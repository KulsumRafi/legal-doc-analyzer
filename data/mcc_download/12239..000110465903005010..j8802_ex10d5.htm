It is recognized that damages in the event of breach of Section 2 by the

Executive would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is

therefore agreed that the Corporation, in addition to and without limiting any

other remedy or right they may have, shall have the right to an injunction or

other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any

such breach, and the Executive hereby waives any and all defenses he may have

on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such

an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right shall not

preclude any other rights and remedies at law or in equity which the

Corporation may have.</p>
