time to time be parties to the Credit Agreement (collectively, together with The

certain credit facilities available to the Borrower upon the terms and
conditions contained in a credit agreement among the Borrower, the Guarantor,

"CREDIT AGREEMENT");

         AND WHEREAS the Borrower has requested of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders that the Credit Agreement be amended as hereinafter provided and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed to permit such amendments to

thereof the following as paragraph (w):

         "(w) Encumbrances, not otherwise permitted in this definition, securing
         Permitted Debt not in excess of $25 million in the aggregate, provided
         such Encumbrances are subordinated to the Security Interests granted to
         the Lenders in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent."

3.       REFERENCE TO AND EFFECT ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. On and after this
