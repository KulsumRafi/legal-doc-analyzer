Section 1:  Policies & Practices

PURPOSE

      company annual business objectives.

      plan does not apply to results achieved in FY2003.

ELIGIBILITY SCOPE

      The following exempt job types with pay grades equal to or higher than E06

                                                                         Rev 4.0

ENROLLMENT

      Annual enrollment is completed at the beginning of the Fiscal Plan year.
      If there is no enrollment sheet on file with Corporate Compensation by
      December 31, 2002 for the FY2003 plan, no portion of the variable
      component will be paid for FY2003 performance.

      All new VIP participants as of the Focal will be enrolled effective
      October 2002. An enrollment sheet for new participants must be completed
      and forwarded to compensation within 30 days of the Focal effective date.

      Any increase in participation level at Focal will be effective April 1,
      2003 and does not require a new enrollment form.

NEW HIRES

      New employees with VIP participation as part of the hire offer will be
      eligible effective the first day of the new quarter following effective
      date of hire. An enrollment sheet must be completed and forwarded to
      compensation within 30 days of the hire date.

INTERNAL TRANSFERS

      Not-applicable

PROMOTION OUTSIDE FOCAL

      When promoted from a non-eligible pay level to a pay level eligible for
      VIP, VIP (if elected by the manager when optional) is effective the first
      day of the new quarter following the promotion effective date. A new
      enrollment sheet must be completed and forwarded to compensation within 30
      days of the promotion date.

PLAN METRICS

      All annual VIP targets are set by executive management, and are subject to
      change during the plan year.

PLAN CHANGES

      In the event of a material change to an existing plan (to be determined by
      the Corporate Compensation Committee), the plan administrator will
      coordinate distribution of new plans and enrollment forms to the affected
      participants.

REORGANIZATIONS

      The Corporate Compensation Committee will make the final decision
      regarding plan changes due to reorganizations.

PAYMENT CYCLES

      Quarterly VIP payouts are paid by the end of the proceeding month
      following the end of the fiscal quarter.

VIP CALCULATIONS

      Quarterly VIP payouts are calculated based on individual target dollars
      and achievement of plan objectives. Individual target dollars are
      determined on an ongoing basis throughout the plan year. If individual
      base pay or quarterly VIP percentage changes, quarterly target dollars
      change. The VIP Plan is intended to recognize group performance.

      Calculation Example:

      (CERTAIN ONE-TIME CHARGES MAY BE EXCLUDED. THE UNPLANNED FINANCIAL IMPACTS
      OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES WILL NOT BE INCLUDED FOR THE YEAR IN
      WHICH THEY WERE ACQUIRED. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL REVIEW QUARTERLY
      RESULTS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS. THE CORPORATE
      COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW PAYOUTS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS).

TERMINATIONS- VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY

      To be eligible for payout under any FY2003 VIP plan, the participant must
      be a Virage Logic employee, or an employee of a subsidiary or branch
      office of Virage Logic Corporation as of the payout date.

      In the event of an employee's death, participation in any VIP plan will
      continue for 30 days following the date of death, or the end of the plan
      year, whichever occurs first. Earned prorated VIP payments will be paid to
      the employee's estate after the end of the quarterly payout schedule.


LEAVES OF ABSENCE-MEDICAL/FAMILY/PERSONAL/SABBATICAL

      Before a personal leave begins, employees must use all accrued PTO hours
      until depleted. Once PTO hours are depleted, employees will be placed on
      an unpaid leave status. VIP payout calculations will include time charged
      to PTO. Quarterly VIP Payouts for employees with leaves of absence less
      than or equal to 90 days during FY2003 will not be prorated to exclude the
      leave of absence.

      Quarterly VIP payouts for employees with unpaid leaves of absence over 90
      days in duration during FY2003 will be prorated to exclude the entire
      leave of absence.

COMMUNICATION

      VIP plan participation is communicated to participants by HR and the
      employees' manager at the beginning of the Plan year. Performance
      objectives are communicated to participants by the CFO and the
      Departmental Managers with approval of the CFO, as soon as the annual
      targets are finalized. The CFO on a quarterly basis communicates updates
      on progress toward objectives to participants.

PLAN YEAR:             FY2003

PLAN PURPOSE:          The purpose of the Virage Logic VIP plan is to link
                       employee contributions and company performance.

FY2003 ELIGIBILITY:    Employees in Pay Grades E06 (with managing positions) -
                       E09

PLAN METRIC:           Payout will be determined on achievement of corporate
                       performance as measured by FY2003 planned revenue and
                       operating profit each quarter of the fiscal year.
                       Operating Profit Dollars will be adjusted for unusual
                       accounting items (stock-based compensation charges,
                       re-valuation of warrants, other one-time charges) as
                       directed by the Board of Directors.

                       payout above Plan is capped at 2X. The payout is

                       calculated as follows: (employee's salary paid during
