     if such Member is a Market Participant, on the same terms and conditions as

     A Units or Class B Units. In the event that the Preemptive  Units are to be

     Members shall be entitled to participate  in such offering by  substituting
     consideration  in cash in an amount  equal to the Fair  Market  Value,  per

     Basic  Amount,  any  additional  Units (if any) that such Member  elects to
     purchase if one or more other Members elect to purchase less than all their
     full Basic Amounts (the "Undersubscription Amount"). If the aggregate Basic
     Amount  subscribed  for by all  Members  is  less  than  the  total  of all
     Preemptive Units then being offered,  then each Member who has set forth an
     Undersubscription  Amount in its Preemptive  Notice of Acceptance  shall be
     entitled   to   purchase,   in   addition   to  its   Basic   Amount,   the
     Undersubscription Amount it has subscribed for; provided,  however, that if
     the  aggregate  Undersubscription  Amounts  subscribed  for by the  Members
     exceed the difference between the total of all of the Preemptive Units then
     being  offered  and  the  aggregate  Basic  Amounts   subscribed  for  (the
     "Available  Undersubscription Amount"), then each Member who has subscribed
     for any  Undersubscription  Amount shall be entitled to purchase  only that
     portion of the Available  Undersubscription Amount as the Undersubscription
     Amount  subscribed for by such Member bears to the total  Undersubscription
     Amounts subscribed for by all Members,  subject to rounding by the Managing
     Member to the extent it deems reasonably necessary.

          (iii)The  Company  shall have one hundred  twenty  (120) days from the
     date of the  Preemptive  Notice  to issue  and sell all or any part of such
     Preemptive Units as to which a Preemptive Notice of Acceptance has not been
     given by the Members, but only upon terms and conditions (including prices)
     which are not, taken as a whole,  more favorable to the acquiring Person or
     Persons  or less  favorable  to the  Company  than  those  set forth in the
     Preemptive Offer, and, promptly following the closing of any such sale, the
     Managing  Member shall provide each Member with written notice of such sale
     which  identifies  the Units sold and the type and amount of  consideration
     received  therefor.  Any  Preemptive  Units not  acquired by the Members or
     other Persons in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence may not
     be offered or issued until they are again  offered to the Members under the
     procedures specified in this Section 3.1(d).

          (iv) All rights  under this  Section 3.1 (d) shall be  suspended  with
     respect to Units proposed to be sold by the Company to  GridAmerica  HoldCo
     in  connection  with a Qualified  Public  Offering,  upon the filing by the
     Company of a  registration  statement  relating  to such  Qualified  Public
     Offering  and  such  suspension  shall  continue  until  such  registration
     statement is  withdrawn,  at which time all rights shall be  reinstated  in
     full, or until the consummation of such Qualified Public Offering, at which
     time all rights of the Members  under this Section 3.1 (d) shall  terminate
     and expire.

     Section 3.2. Unit Classes; Automatic Conversion; Etc.

     (a)  Unit Classes. Membership in the Company shall be represented by Units.
There  shall be two  classes  of Units:  the  "Class A Units"  and the  "Class B
Units," each of which shall have identical rights (including the identical right
to the Profits (or Losses),  distributions and other economic  attributes of the
Company as set forth in Articles V and IX), preferences and designations, except
as hereinafter provided below in this Section 3.2(a):

          (i)  Class A Units:  Except as otherwise provided herein,  each holder
     of Class A Units shall be entitled to vote on all matters  presented to the
     Members for their action or consideration. Class A Units shall be held only
     by Non-Market Participants.

          (ii) Class B Units:  Holders  of Class B Units  shall  have no  voting
     rights,  except (A) as set forth in Section  6.6(b) and (B) on those  other
     matters  that  require  the  approval  of the  holders  of Class B Units as
     specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

     (b)  Registration  of Units.  The Company  shall  maintain a registry  (the
"Unit Registry") upon which all Units issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be
registered in the name of the Member which is the registered holder thereof. The
Unit Registry shall  establish,  as of any time, the owners of Units,  and Units
may not be  Transferred  except  by  notation  of such  Transfer  upon  the Unit
Registry.  The Company and the  Managing  Member shall treat the Person in whose
name a Unit is  registered  in the  Unit  Registry  as the  owner  of the  Units
represented  thereby  for all  purposes.  No Transfer of Units shall be valid as
against the Company unless  registered in the name of the transferee on the Unit
Registry.

     (c)  Automatic  Conversion  of Class A Units.  In the  event  that a Member
holding Class A Units (i) is or becomes a Market  Participant  or (ii) Transfers
Class A Units to a Market Participant, then either (A) all such Member's Class A
Units in the case of clause  (i) above or (B) the Class A Units  Transferred  in
the case of clause  (ii) above,  automatically,  without  the  necessity  of any
action on the part of such Member or the Company  shall be converted  (effective
as of such time that such Member becomes a Market Participant or Transfers Class
A Units to a Market  Participant)  into the same  number of Class B Units,  such
that  the  Percentage  Interest  of any  Member  (other  than,  in the case of a
Transfer,  the transferor  Member) shall remain unchanged.  Promptly,  but in no
event  more than ten (10)  days  after  the date  such  Member  becomes a Market
Participant and no fewer than fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed  effective
date of a Transfer of such Member's Class A Units to a Market Participant,  such
Member (and, in the case of a Transfer, the transferee) will deliver or cause to
be  delivered  to the  Company  notification  of the  foregoing  and the Company
promptly shall make the  appropriate  notation in

                                       24

the Unit Registry and promptly  shall notify such Member and/or such  transferee
and all other Members that such notation has been made.

     (d)  Conversion of Class B Units.  In the event that a Member holding Class
B Units (i) is or becomes a Non-Market Participant or (ii) Transfers its Class B
Units to an  Non-Market  Participant,  then  either  (A) all or any part of such
Member's Class B Units in the case of clause (i) above or (B) all or any part of
the Class B Units  Transferred  in the case of clause (ii) above  shall,  at the
written  request of the holder  thereof,  be  converted  into the same number of
Class A Units,  such that the Percentage  Interest of any Member (other than, in
the case of a Transfer,  the  transferor  Member)  shall remain  unchanged.  Any
written  request  pursuant to this Section  3.2(d),  shall  include a Non-Market
Participation Certification. Upon receipt by the Company of such written request
and Non-Market  Participant  Certification,  the Company promptly shall make the
appropriate  notation in the Unit Registry and promptly shall notify such Member
or such transferee that such notation has been made.

     (e)  Optional  Conversion.  Any Member that acquires Class A Units (whether
from the Company  pursuant to Section  3.1,  by  conversion  pursuant to Section
3.2(d),  or by Transfer from another Member pursuant to Section 3.3) and that is
a Non-Market Participant, shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to elect to have some or all of its Class A Units converted into the same number
of Class B Units by delivering to the Company such Member's  written election to
convert  some or all of its Class A Units for the same  number of Class B Units.
Upon receipt of such election,  the Company  promptly shall make the appropriate
notation in the Unit  Registry and  promptly  shall notify such Member that such
notation has been made.

     (f)  Votes/Approvals  of Members  Holding  Class A Units.  Each time that a
Member  holding  Class A Units votes its Class A Units on any matter  under this
Agreement,  such  Member  automatically,  without the  necessity  of any further
action,  shall be deemed to have represented and warranted to the Company and to
the other  Members that such Member is an Non-Market  Participant  and, upon the
reasonable  request of the  Managing  Member,  as a condition  precedent to such
Member's  right to vote its Class A Units,  such  Member  shall  deliver  to the
Company an Non-Market  Participant  Certification.  Not later than January 15 of
each  year,  each  holder  of Class A Units  shall  deliver  to the  Company  an
Non-Market  Participant  Certification  that  certifies that such holder is and,
during the immediately preceding calendar year, was, a Non-Market Participant.

     (g)  Contest of Holder's Non-Market Participant Status. The Company and any
Member  may at any time  contest  in  accordance  with  Article  X a  Non-market
Participant  Certification delivered by any Person or such Person's status as an
Non-Market  Participant;  provided,  however, that if the Managing Member causes
the Company to  challenge a Person's  Non-Market  Participant  Certification  or
Non-Market  Participant  status,  such challenge (i) shall be made in good faith
and must not involve an  unreasonable  expenditure of Company funds and (ii) the
Company, promptly after the commencement of such a challenge,  shall give notice
of  such  challenge  to all  other  Members,  which  notice  shall  set  forth a
reasonably  detailed  description  of the  basis  for such  challenge  and shall
include copies of any legal opinions or other documentation in the possession of
the Managing Member describing the basis for such challenge.

                                       25

<PAGE>

     (h)  Reliance on Non-Market Participant Certification.  The Managing Member
may rely  without  investigation  on any  Non-Market  Participant  Certification
delivered pursuant hereto.

     Nothing in this  Section 3.2 shall be  construed  to limit the right of the
Commission  to review  Non-Market  Participant  Certifications  and  declare the
Person delivering such Non-Market  Participant  Certification to be a Non-Market
Participant or a Market  Participant,  as the case may be. Any  determination of
the  Commission  to the  effect  that a  Person  is a Market  Participant  shall
supersede and override the  Non-Market  Certification  with respect to which the
determination is made.

     Section 3.3. Transfers of Units; Exclusivity Period.

     (a)  Transferability  of Units.  Subject  to  Sections  3.3(b),  3.3(d) and
3.3(e), Units may be Transferred at any time and from time to time by any Person
to any other Person,  including the Company, without the consent of the Company,
the other  Members  or,  except in the case of a Transfer  to the  Company,  the
Managing Member.  Except as otherwise  provided in this Section 3.3, if a Member
Transfers all or a portion of its Units, the transferee shall be admitted to the
Company as a Member of the Company  without the need for any  additional  act or
consent of the Company or any Member.  Immediately following such admission, the
transferor  shall,  either (i) if such transferor  Transferred all of its Units,
cease to be a Member of the Company or (ii) if such transferor  Transferred less
than all of its Units, have its Percentage  Interest  appropriately  adjusted to
reflect the Transfer to the transferee of such Units.  Any successor to a Member
by  merger  or  consolidation   shall,   subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  the
requirements of Section 3.3(b), be admitted as a Member.

     (b)  Conditions to  Effectiveness  of a Transfer.  In  connection  with any
Transfer of Units,  the  transferor  and its  transferee  shall,  as  conditions
precedent to the  effectiveness  of any such  Transfer,  (i) give prior  written
notice to the Company and to all Members no fewer than  fifteen  (15) days prior
to the proposed effective date of such Transfer, which notice shall identify the
transferee  and  specify  the number and class of the  transferor's  Units to be
Transferred,  (ii) furnish a copy of the Transfer  instrument to the Company and
to all  Members,  (iii)  execute  and  deliver  to the  Company  a  Ratification
Agreement,  (iv) if Class A Units are being  Transferred,  either (A) deliver to
the Company a Non-Market Participant Certification or (B) deliver to the Company
a  written  acknowledgement  of the  transferor  and  the  transferee  that  the
transferred  Units  shall  be,  effective  upon  such  Transfer,   automatically
converted  into the same  number of Class B Units,  (v) deliver to the Company a
Favorable  Opinion of Counsel and (vi) pay, or  reimburse  the Company  for, all
reasonable  costs  and  expenses  of the  Company  incurred  by the  Company  in
connection  with such Transfer or otherwise  make  provision for the same.  Upon
receipt by the Company of the foregoing  documents,  the Company shall  promptly
make the appropriate notations reflecting the Transfer in the Unit Registry.

     (c)  Transfers Not in Compliance.  Any attempted  Transfer of a Unit, other
than in  strict  accordance  with this  Section  3.3,  shall  be,  and is hereby
declared,  null and void ab  initio.  The  Members  agree  that a breach  of the
provisions of this Section 3.3 may cause  irreparable  injury to the Company and
to the  Members  for  which  monetary  damages  (or  other  remedy  at law)  are
inadequate in view of (i) the  complexities  and  uncertainties in measuring the
actual  damages that would be sustained by reason of the failure of a transferor
to comply with such

                                       26

<PAGE>

provisions  and  (ii)  the   uniqueness  of  the  Company's   business  and  the
relationship among the Members.  Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 3.3
may be enforced by specific performance.

     (d)  Exclusivity  Period.  If a Member  proposes to consider  soliciting an
offer to Sell  any  Units or is  approached  by  another  Person  regarding  any
proposed  transaction  in which  such  Member  would  Sell its  Units,  prior to
entering  into  substantive  negotiations  to Sell such Units,  such Member (the
"Selling  Member") shall first submit a written notice to each other Member (the
"Sale  Notice")  that the  Selling  Member  may Sell such  Units  (the  "Subject
Units"),  which notice shall specify whether the Selling Member has received any
third party offer for such Subject Units which it intends to accept. In order to
give the other  Members  the  option to make an offer to  purchase  the  Subject
Units,  the Selling  Member (i) shall not Sell the Subject  Units and (ii) shall
not discuss, negotiate or otherwise provide information concerning such Units to
any other Person,  except in connection  with a transaction in which the Selling
Member does not propose to Sell such  Subject  Units,  for thirty (30) days from
the date of the delivery of the Sale Notice. No Member shall have any obligation
to make an offer to purchase  such  Subject  Units and the Selling  Member shall
have no  obligation to consider,  negotiate or accept any such offer.  After the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Selling Member shall have one (1)
year thereafter to enter into definitive agreements to Sell the Subject Units to
a third party.  If at the end of such period the Selling  Member has not entered
into definitive  agreements to Sell such Subject Units,  the Selling Member will
be obligated to comply with this Section 3.3(d). The rights of the Members under
this Section  3.3(d) shall not apply to any sale of Units in a Qualified  Public
Offering and shall terminate upon the closing of a Qualified Public Offering.

     (e)  Publicly Traded Partnership.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein,  no  transfer  of Units may be made to any Person if as a result of such
transfer the Company would have more than one hundred  (100) Members  determined
in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1) and (3).

     Section  3.4.  Resignation.  A Member  has no right or power to  resign  or
withdraw from the Company except as specifically provided for in this Agreement.

                              ---------------------

     Section 4.1. Capital Contributions to Fund Capital Expenditures and Working
Capital Needs.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.3, the Initial
Member and/or one or more Affiliated  Investors shall (or in the case of Section

follows:

     (a)  Capital  Contributions  on  the  Transmission  Service  Date.  On  the

amount of $50,000 in exchange for 1000 Units.

     (b)  Capital   Contributions  to  Fund  Capital  Expenditures  and  Working
Capital.  Following the Effective Date,  when and as the Initial Member,  in the
performance of its duties or obligations as Managing Member, determines that the
Company is in need of additional funds to

                                       27

<PAGE>

pay for Capital Expenditures relating to System-Wide Capital Expenditures or for
additional  working capital  purposes,  the Initial  Member,  shall and/or shall
cause one or more Affiliated  Investors to, make cash Capital  Contributions  in
exchange for Units in the amount so determined by the Initial Member;  provided,
however,  that the maximum commitment of Initial Member pursuant to this Section
4.1 (b) shall be $25,000,000.

     (c)  Capital   Contributions  to  Fund  Capital  Expenditures  Relating  to
GridAmerica Transmission  Facilities.  Following the Effective Date, when and as
the Initial Member,  in the performance of its duties or obligations as Managing
Member,  determines  that the Company is in need of additional  funds to pay for
Capital  Expenditures  relating to  GridAmerica  Transmission  Facilities  or to
acquire  GridAmerica  Transmission  Facilities,  the Initial  Member may, at its
election  make,  or cause  one or more  Affiliated  Investors  to make,  Capital
Contributions  in exchange for Units in the amount so  determined by the Initial
Member.

     Section  4.2  Capital   Contributions   Upon  Contribution  of  GridAmerica
Transmission Facilities.

     (a)  Subject to the  limitations  set forth in Sections 4.2(c) and 4.3, the
Initial Member shall cause one or more Affiliated Investors to make cash Capital
Contributions  to the  Company in  exchange  for Units upon the  exercise  by an
GridAmerica  Company  of  a  Put  Right  or  the  purchase  by  the  Company  of
Transmission Facilities from a GridAmerica Company as follows:

          (i)  At each Put Closing,  a cash Capital  Contribution equal to 5% of
     the Fair Market Value of the  Transmission  Facilities  in respect of which
     the Put Right has been exercised;

          (ii) At the closing of each purchase of Transmission Facilities from a
     GridAmerica  Company  other than NGUSA or an  Affiliated  Investor,  a cash
     Capital  Contribution  equal  to  5%  of  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  the
     Transmission Facilities to be purchased by the Company; and

          (iii)At the  option  of  either  the  Initial  Member  or the  Putting
     GridAmerica Company (such option being referred to as the "Cash Option"), a
     cash  Capital  Contribution  up  to  an  additional  15%  (or  such  higher
     percentage  as to which the  Initial  Member  and the  Putting  GridAmerica
     Company may agree) of the Fair Market Value of the Transmission  Facilities
     in respect of which the Put Right has been  exercised,  in which  event (i)
     the number of Units received by the Putting  GridAmerica Company at the Put
     Closing shall be reduced by the number of additional Units purchased by the
     Affiliated  Investors and (ii) such Putting  GridAmerica  Company shall, at
     the Put  Closing,  receive a cash  distribution  in an amount  equal to the
     aggregate amount paid to the Company for such additional Units.

     (b)  Exercise of Cash Option. If either the Putting  GridAmerica Company or
the Initial  Member  desires to exercise its Cash Option,  it shall  provide the
other and the Company with written  notice of such  exercise at least sixty (60)
days prior to the Put Closing,  which notice shall specify the percentage of the
Fair Market Value of contributed  Transmission  Facilities to which the exercise
relates.  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  in this

                                       28

<PAGE>

Section 4.2(b),  if the Initial Member exercises the Cash Option and the Putting
GridAmerica Company determines in good faith that the corresponding distribution
of cash by the Company to such Putting  GridAmerica  Company in connection  with
the exercise of the Cash Option would result in the Putting  GridAmerica Company
being required to recognize  income as a result of such  distribution of cash in
the  calendar  year in which  such  cash  distribution  is made in excess of the
difference between the amount of such cash payment and such Putting  GridAmerica
Company's pro rata tax basis in the Transmission Facilities which are subject to
the Put Notice  (determined  pursuant  to the  Master  Agreement),  the  Putting
GridAmerica Company may, at its election,  upon written notice to NGUSA received
at least thirty (30) days prior to the Put Closing, require NGUSA to rescind the
exercise of the Cash Option. Such notice shall provide a detailed explanation of
the income effect of the exercise by NGUSA of the Cash Option.

     (c)  Limitation  on  Capital   Contribution   Commitment.   Notwithstanding
anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  no Affiliated  Investor shall have
any obligation to make or cause to be made any cash Capital  Contribution to the
Company pursuant to Section 4.2(a) if either:

          (i)  (A) the sum of (I)  the  aggregate  amount  of all  cash  Capital
     Contributions  by any  Affiliated  Investor  pursuant to Section 4.2(a) and
     (II) the  Fair  Market  Value  (determined  at the  time  the  Transmission
     Facilities in question are contributed to the Company pursuant to Article V
     of  the  Master   Agreement)  of  all  Capital   Contributions   comprising
     Transmission  Facilities  made  by the  Initial  Member  and/or  any  NGUSA
     Affiliates  would exceed (B) the difference  between (I)  $500,000,000  and
     (II) the  amount of the  aggregate  Capital  Contributions  of the  Initial
     Member  and/or any  Affiliated  Investor  made  pursuant  to  Section  4.1;
     provided,  however,  that there shall be excluded from such calculation the
     amount, if any, of the Excess Cash Amount; or

          (ii) all Affiliated  Investors would have,  after giving effect to the
     purchase of Units  pursuant to Section 4.2(a) and the issuance to a Putting
     GridAmerica  Company of Units in connection with exercise of the Put Right,
     an aggregate Percentage Interest in the Company in excess of twenty percent
     (20%);   provided,   however,  that  there  shall  be  excluded  from  such
     calculation  all Units  issued to such  Affiliated  Investors  pursuant  to
     Sections  4.1 (a) and 4.1 (b) and any Units issued in respect of the Excess
     Cash Amount.

     (d)  Not Applicable to NGUSA Put Right.  The provisions of Sections  4.2(a)
and  4.2(b)  shall  not  apply  to the  exercise  of a Put  Right  by any  NGUSA
Affiliate.

     Section 4.3. Additional Limitations on Commitment. Notwithstanding anything
contained in Sections 4.1 or 4.2 to the contrary, but subject to Section 4.2(c):

          (i)  The Initial Member and/or any  Affiliated  Investor shall have no
     obligation to make Capital  Contributions  pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2
     in excess of the sum of (A) $500,000,000, plus (B) the Excess Cash Amount.

          (ii) The Initial Member and/or any  Affiliated  Investor shall have no
     obligation to make Capital Contributions in connection with the exercise of
     the Put Right (A) during the final six (6) months of the Initial Term if an
     MM  Termination  Notice or a Non-MM  Termination  Notice has been delivered
     pursuant  to  Section  6.1 (c) or (B) if NGUSA

                                       29

<PAGE>


     exercises its resignation  rights pursuant to clause (D) of Section 6.1(d),
     or (C) at any time  after the  Initial  Member  ceases  to be the  Managing
     Member;   provided,   however,   that  the   obligation   to  make  Capital
     Contributions pursuant to Section 4.2(a) shall continue with respect to the
     exercise of the Put Right if the Put Notice relating  thereto was delivered
     prior to (x) in the case of clause (A)  above,  the final six (6) months of
     the Initial Term or (y) in the case of clause (C) above,  the date that the
     Initial Member ceases to be the Managing Member.

     Section 4.4.  Capital  Contributions  After the Effective Date.  Subject to
Section  3.1(d),  the  Managing  Member  (i)  may,  from  time  to  time  in its
discretion,  accept from an existing  Member or a proposed  new Member a Capital
Contribution in exchange for Units consisting of cash,  Transmission  Facilities
and/or other assets and (ii) if a Capital Contribution is being made pursuant to
the Put Right contained in Article V of the Master  Agreement,  shall, from time
to time,  accept  from an  existing  Member or a  proposed  new Member a Capital
Contribution  consisting  primarily of  Transmission  Facilities  over which the
Company exercises  Functional Control. Any such Capital Contribution must have a
Fair Market Value not less than the Fair Market Value of any consideration to be
paid by the  Company to such  Person,  including  the Units to be issued to such
Person. In connection with Capital  Contributions of Transmission  Facilities by
the Managing Member or any Affiliate of the Managing Member (and, in the case of
the Initial Member,  by any Affiliated  Investor),  the Members,  other than the
Managing  Member  and its  Affiliates,  shall  represent  the  interests  of the
Company.

     Section  4.5. No Other  Required  Capital  Contributions.  Unless it agrees
otherwise  and except as set forth in Sections  4.1 and 4.2, no Member  shall be
obligated to make any additional Capital Contributions to the Company.

     Section 4.6. Return of Capital  Contributions.  No Member shall be entitled
to the return of any part of its Capital Contributions or to be paid interest in
respect of either its Capital Account or its Capital Contributions.  An unrepaid
Capital  Contribution  is not a liability  of the  Company or of any  Member.  A
Member is not  required  to  contribute  or to lend any cash or  property to the
Company to enable the Company to return any Member's Capital Contributions.

     Section 4.7. Capital Accounts.

     (a)  A Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Member.
Each Member's  Capital Account (i) shall be increased by (A) the amount of money
contributed  by that  Member  to the  Company,  (B) the Book  Value of  property
contributed  by that Member to the Company (net of  liabilities  secured by such
contributed property that the Company is considered to assume or take subject to
under Code  Section 752) and (C)  allocations  to that Member of Profits and any
items of income or gain  allocated  to such Member  pursuant  to the  Regulatory
Allocations  and (ii) shall be decreased by (A) the amount of money  distributed
to that Member by the  Company,  (B) the Book Value of property  distributed  to
that  Member by the  Company  (net of  liabilities  secured by such  distributed
property  that such Member is considered to assume or take subject to under Code
Section 752) and (C)  allocations to that Member of Losses and any items of loss
or deduction allocated to such Member pursuant to the Regulatory Allocations.  A
Member  that has more than one Unit shall  have a single  Capital  Account  that
reflects all such Units,  regardless  of the class of Units owned by such Member
and regardless of the time or

                                       30

manner in which such Units were acquired. Upon the disposition of any Units, the
Capital Account of the disposing Member that is attributable to such Units shall
carry  over to the  assignee  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(1).

     (b)  The foregoing  provisions  and the other  provisions of this Agreement
relating to the  maintenance  of Capital  Accounts  are  intended to comply with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and applied in
a manner  consistent with such Treasury  Regulations.  In the event the Managing
Member  shall  determine  that it is necessary to modify the manner in which the
Capital  Accounts,  or any debits or credits  thereto,  are computed in order to
comply  with  such  Treasury  Regulations,  the  Managing  Member  may make such
modification;  provided,  however,  that (i) it is not likely to have a material
effect on the amounts  distributed to any Member pursuant to Section 5.6(d) upon
the  liquidation  of the Company and (ii) prior to making any such  modification
(A) the Managing  Member obtains the written  consent of all Members that may be
reasonably  likely to be adversely  affected by such modification or (B) if such
consent or  consents  cannot be  obtained,  the  Managing  Member  obtains a tax
opinion from a nationally  recognized  tax counsel with expertise in partnership
tax matters,  which  counsel is reasonably  acceptable to the Members  holding a
majority  in  interest  of the  Percentage  Interests,  to the  effect  that the
proposed  modifications  of the Managing Member are necessary to comply with the
Treasury  Regulations.  The  Managing  Member  also shall be  entitled  to make,
subject to the  foregoing  proviso,  (i) any  adjustments  that are necessary or
appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of the Members and
the amount of Company  capital  reflected on the  Company's  balance  sheet,  as
computed for book  purposes,  in accordance  with Treasury  Regulations  Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q),  and  (ii)  any  appropriate  modifications  in the  event
unanticipated  events (for example, the acquisition by the Company of oil or gas
properties)  might  otherwise  cause this  Agreement not to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b).

     Section  4.8.  Units Issued In Respect of Capital  Contributions.  A Member
that makes Capital  Contributions shall receive Units having a Fair Market Value
equal to the amount of cash or the Fair  Market  Value of any other  property so
contributed as a Capital Contribution.

                          ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

     Section 5.1. Allocations of Profits and Losses. Profits and Losses shall be
allocated  among the Members in accordance with their Percentage Interests.

     Section 5.2.  Regulatory  Allocations.  The following  allocations shall be
made in the following order:

          (i)  Nonrecourse  Deductions  shall be  allocated  to the  Members  in
     accordance with their Percentage Interests.

          (ii) Member Nonrecourse Deductions  attributable to Member Nonrecourse
     Debt shall be  allocated to the Members  bearing the Economic  Risk of Loss
     for such Member  Nonrecourse Debt as determined  under Treasury  Regulation
     Sections  1.704-2(b)(4)  and  1.752-2.  If more than one  Member  bears the
     Economic  Risk of  Loss  for  such

                                       31

<PAGE>

     Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member Nonrecourse Deductions  attributable to
     such Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be allocated among the Members according
     to the ratio in which they bear the  Economic  Risk of Loss.  This  Section
     5.2(ii) is intended to comply with the  provisions  of Treasury  Regulation
     Section  1.704-2(i)  and  shall be  interpreted  and  applied  consistently
     therewith.

          (iii)Notwithstanding  any other provision  hereof to the contrary,  if
     there is a net decrease in Minimum Gain for a taxable year (or if there was
     a net decrease in Minimum Gain for a prior taxable year and the Company did
     not have  sufficient  amounts  of income  and gain  during  prior  years to
     allocate  among the Members under this Section  5.2(iii)),  items of income
     and gain  shall be  allocated  to each  Member in an  amount  equal to such
     Member's  share of the net  decrease in such  Minimum  Gain (as  determined
     pursuant  to  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.704-2(g)(2)).  This  Section
     5.2(iii) is intended to constitute a minimum gain chargeback under Treasury
     Regulation   Section  1.704-2(f)  and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied
     consistently therewith.

          (iv) Notwithstanding  any  provision  hereof  to the  contrary  except
     Section 5.2(iii) (dealing with Minimum Gain), if there is a net decrease in
     Member  Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain for a taxable year (or if there was a
     net decrease in Member  Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum Gain for a prior  taxable
     year and the  Company  did not have  sufficient  amounts of income and gain
     during  prior  years to  allocate  among the  Members  under  this  Section
     5.2(iv),  items of income and gain shall be  allocated to each Member in an
     amount  equal  to  such  Member's  share  of the  net  decrease  in  Member
     Nonrecourse   Debt  Minimum  Gain  (as  determined   pursuant  to  Treasury
     Regulation  Section  1.704-2(i)(4)).  This  Section  5.2(iv) is intended to
     constitute  a  partner  nonrecourse  debt  minimum  gain  chargeback  under
     Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.704-2(i)(4)  and shall be interpreted  and
     applied consistently therewith.

          (v)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  hereof  to the  contrary  except
     Sections   5.2(iii)  and  (iv)   (dealing  with  Minimum  Gain  and  Member
     Nonrecourse  Debt  Minimum  Gain),  a Member who  unexpectedly  receives an
     adjustment,  allocation or  distribution  described in Treasury  Regulation
     Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),  (5) or (6) shall be  allocated  items of
     income and gain  (consisting  of a pro rata portion of each item of income,
     including  gross  income,  and gain for the taxable  year) in an amount and
     manner  sufficient  to  eliminate  any  deficit  balance  in such  Member's
     Adjusted  Capital  Account as quickly as possible.  This Section  5.2(v) is
     intended to constitute a qualified income offset under Treasury  Regulation
     Section   1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)   and  shall  be  interpreted   consistently
     therewith.

          (vi) In the event  that any Member  has a  negative  Adjusted  Capital
     Account at the end of any  taxable  year,  such Member  shall be  allocated
     items of  income  and gain in the  amount of such  deficit  as  quickly  as
     possible;  provided,  however,  that an allocation pursuant to this Section
     5.2(vi) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have
     a negative  Adjusted Capital Account after all other  allocations  provided
     for in this Article V have been  tentatively  made as if Section 5.2(v) and
     this Section 5.2(vi) were not in this Agreement.

          (vii)To the  extent an  adjustment  to the  adjusted  tax basis of any
     asset  pursuant to Code Section  734(b) or Code Section  743(b) is required
     pursuant  to  Treasury   Regulation  Section   1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2)   or
     1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4)  to be taken into  account in  determining  Capital
     Accounts  as the  result  of a  distribution  to  any  Member  in  complete
     liquidation  of such  Member's  Units,  the  amount of such  adjustment  to
     Capital  Accounts  shall be treated  as an item of gain (if the  adjustment
     increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
     basis)  and  such  gain  or loss  shall  be  allocated  to the  Members  in
     accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) if such
     Section  applies,  or to the Member to whom such  distribution  was made if
     Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.

          (viii)  If  the  Treasury  Regulations  incorporating  the  Regulatory
     Allocations  are  hereafter  changed  or if new  Treasury  Regulations  are
     hereafter  adopted,  and such changed or new Treasury  Regulations,  in the
     opinion of tax counsel for the  Company,  make it  necessary  to revise the
     Regulatory Allocations or provide further special allocation rules in order
     to avoid a significant  risk that a material  portion of any allocation set
     forth in this  Article V would not be  respected  for  federal  income  tax
     purposes,  the  Members  shall  make  such  reasonable  amendments  to this
     Agreement as, in the opinion of such  counsel,  are necessary or desirable,
     taking into  account the  interests of the Members as a whole and all other
     relevant factors, to avoid or reduce  significantly such risk to the extent
     possible   without   materially   changing   the  amounts   allocable   and
     distributable to any Member pursuant to this Agreement.

     Section 5.3. Curative Allocations.  The Regulatory Allocations are intended
to comply with  certain  requirements  of the  Treasury  Regulations.  It is the
intent of the Members that, to the extent possible,  all Regulatory  Allocations
shall be  offset  either  with  other  Regulatory  Allocations  or with  special
allocations of other items of Company income,  gain, loss or deduction  pursuant
to this  Section 5.3.  Therefore,  notwithstanding  any other  provision of this
Article V (other than the  Regulatory  Allocations),  the Managing  Member shall
make such  offsetting  special  allocations  of Company  income,  gain,  loss or
deduction in whatever manner it determines to be appropriate so that, after such
offsetting  allocations are made,  each Member's  Capital Account balance is, to
the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Member would have
had if the  Regulatory  Allocations  were  not  part  of the  Agreement  and all
Partnership  items were  allocated  pursuant to Section 5.1. In  exercising  its
discretion  under this Section 5.3, the Managing  Member shall take into account
future Regulatory Allocations under Sections 5.2(iii) and 5.2(iv) that, although
not yet made, are likely to offset other Regulatory  Allocations previously made
under Sections 5.2(i) and 5.2(ii).

     Section 5.4. Income Tax Allocations.

     (a)  All items of income,  gain,  loss and deduction for federal income tax
purposes  shall be  allocated  in the same manner as the  corresponding  item of
Profits and Losses is allocated, except as provided in Section 5.4(b).

     (b)  In accordance  with Code Section  704(c) and the  applicable  Treasury
Regulations  thereunder,  income,  gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any
property contributed to the Company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated
among the Members so as to take  account of

                                       33

<PAGE>

any  variation  between the adjusted  basis of such  property to the Company for
federal  income tax purposes  and its initial Book Value.  In the event that any
property is adjusted  pursuant to clause (ii) or (iv) of the  definition of Book
Value,  subsequent  allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect
to such property shall take account of any variation  between the adjusted basis
of such property for federal  income tax purposes and its Book Value in the same
manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the applicable  Regulations  thereunder.
For  purposes  of such  allocations,  the  Company  shall  elect the  Designated
Allocation  Method,  and  in  applying  the  Designated   Allocation  Method  to
depreciable property, the Company shall compute allocations using the method set
forth on Schedule B. Subject to the provisions of Treasury  Regulations  Section
1.704-3,  the Company may use different  methods with respect to different items
of property.

     (c)  Any (i) recapture of depreciation  deductions  shall be allocated,  in
accordance with Treasury  Regulations  Section  1.1245-1(e),  to the Members who
received the benefit of such  deductions  (taking into account the effect of the
Designated  Allocation  Method) and (ii) recapture of credits shall be allocated
to the Members in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section  1.704-1(b)(4)(ii)
unless the applicable Code section shall otherwise require.

     (d)  Allocations  pursuant to this  Section 5.4 are solely for  purposes of
federal,  state,  and local taxes and shall not  affect,  or in any way be taken
into account in  computing,  any Member's  Capital  Account or share of Profits,
Losses,  other  items  or  distributions  pursuant  to  any  provision  of  this
Agreement.

     Section 5.5. Other Allocation Rules.

     (a)  All items of income,  gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable to an
interest  in the  Company  that may have  been  transferred  shall be  allocated
between the transferor and the transferee in accordance with the interim closing
of the books method as provided in the Treasury  Regulations  under Code Section
706(d).

     (b)  The  Members'   proportionate   shares  of  the  "excess   nonrecourse
liabilities" of the Company,  within the meaning of Treasury  Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3),   shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  their   Percentage
Interests.

     Section 5.6. Distributions.

     (a)  Distributions   Upon   Contributions   of   GridAmerica   Transmission
Facilities.   The   Managing   Member  shall  cause  the  Company  to  make  the
distributions required by Section 4.2(a)(iii).

     (b)  Regular Distributions.  The Managing Member shall cause the Company to
distribute  simultaneously  to  each  Member  in  proportion  to its  respective
Percentage Interest, not less frequently than each calendar month, not less than
eighty percent (80%) of Available Cash and (ii) the Managing  Member may, in its
discretion make additional  distributions  of Available Cash, but any such other
distributions  must be made  simultaneously  to each Member in proportion to its
respective Percentage Interest.

                                       34

<PAGE>

     (c)  Tax Distribution.  As soon as practicable  following the close of each
taxable period, the Company shall, to the extent it has Available Cash therefor,
distribute  to each  Member the  excess,  if any,  of (i) the product of (A) the
Cumulative Net Profits  allocated to such Member,  multiplied by (B) the highest
marginal federal ordinary income tax rate applicable to corporations,  over (ii)
the amount of any  distributions  previously made pursuant to Section 5.6(b) and
this Section  5.6(c) to such Member.  In the event that adequate  Available Cash
does not exist to make the  distributions  required by this Section 5.6(b),  the
Company shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to incur Debt in at least the
amount necessary to make such distributions.

     (d)  Distributions  on Dissolution and Winding Up. Upon the dissolution and
winding  up of the  Company,  after  adjusting  the  Capital  Accounts  for  all
distributions made under Sections 5.6(a), 5.6(b) and 5.6(c), and all allocations
under this  Article V, all  available  assets  distributable  to the  Members as
determined  under  Section  9.2(v)  shall  be  distributed  to  the  Members  in
accordance with their positive Capital Account balances.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                   MANAGEMENT
                                   ----------

     Section 6.1. Management of the Company.

     (a)  Managing Member.  The management of the Company shall be vested in the
Member that is designated as the "Managing  Member" in accordance  with Sections
6.1(b) and 6.1(e). Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Managing  Member shall have full power and  authority to manage the business and
affairs of the Company to the extent  provided in the Act,  and no other  Member
shall have any such  management  power and authority.  The Managing Member shall
use commercially  reasonable  efforts to employ or otherwise secure the services
of Persons  responsible  for the  management  and  system-wide  operation of the
Transmission  Facilities owned and/or Functionally Controlled by the Company and
to  appoint  any of  such  Persons  as  officers  of  the  Company  having  such
responsibilities and obligations as the Managing Member shall specify; provided,
however, that except for Excluded Employees,  such Persons shall be employees of
the Managing  Member or the Company and not  employees  of any  Affiliate of the
Managing Member (other than the Company or any subsidiary of the Managing Member
or the  Company).  Initially  (x)  Nick  Winser  of  NGUSA  will  serve as chief
executive officer of the Company and will devote  significant time and attention
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and (y) Paul Halas of NGUSA will
serve as general  counsel of the Company and will  devote  significant  time and
attention to the business and affairs of the Company, provided, that Nick Winser
and Paul  Halas  may each  also  serve  in a  similar  or  different  roles  and
capacities  for other ITCs as well as for NGUSA and its  Affiliates.  Subject to
the right of the Initial  Member to resign as Managing  Member as  permitted  by
Section 6.1(d),  for so long as the Initial Member is the Managing  Member,  the
Initial Member and its Affiliates will maintain Non-Market Participant status.

     (b)  Designation and Removal of Managing  Member.  The Initial Member shall

be the initial Managing  Member.  It shall serve for a term (the "Initial Term")
that commences on the Effective Date and shall end upon the fifth anniversary of
the  Transmission  Service Date (the "Scheduled  Termination  Date");  provided,
however, that the Initial Member's term as Managing

                                       35

<PAGE>

Member shall terminate prior to the Scheduled  Termination  Date or prior to the
end of any Additional Term (i) if it (or any of its Affiliates that are required
to  maintain  Non-Market  Participant  status)  shall  have  been  found  by the
Commission,  in a final  order of the  Commission  that is no longer  subject to
rehearing,  to be a Market  Participant or (ii) for Cause if a Super Majority of
Transmission  Owners shall have delivered  written notice that they have elected
to remove the Managing  Member for Cause  pursuant to this  Agreement or a Super
Majority of  Transmission  Owners shall have delivered  written notice that they
have  elected to cause the  Company to remove the  Managing  Member for  "cause"
pursuant to Section 4.4.3 of the Operation Agreement, which removal shall become
effective  on the date  specified  in, but no sooner than sixty (60) days after,
delivery to the Managing  Member,  each  GridAmerica  Company and each NDTO of a
written notice of such election to remove (each, an "Early Termination  Event").
Notwithstanding  anything in clause (ii) of the immediately  proceeding sentence
to the contrary,  (x) if the Managing  Member  disputes  whether the grounds for
removal  exist by  written  notice  to each  GridAmerica  Company  and each NDTO
delivered  within  thirty  (30) days of  receipt by the  Managing  Member of the
election to remove the  Managing  Member,  no Early  Termination  Event shall be
deemed to occur until sixty (60) days after receipt of a final arbitration award
pursuant to Section 10.3 finding that such grounds for removal  exist and (y) no
removal of the Managing  Member shall be effective  unless and until approved by
the Commission.  The initial term of any successor Managing Member (a "Successor
Initial Term") shall be as set forth in the instrument appointing such successor
Managing Member,  but, in any event,  shall terminate upon an Early  Termination
Event.

     (c)  Automatic  Extension of Managing  Member's Term.  Notwithstanding  the
expiration of the Initial Term on the Scheduled  Termination  Date,  the Initial
Term and,  unless  otherwise  provided in the instrument  appointing a successor
Managing Member,  the Successor  Initial Term of any successor  Managing Member,
automatically  shall be extended for an additional  term of two (2) years at the
end of the Initial  Term or  Successor  Initial Term (as the case may be) unless
written notice of  termination of the Managing  Member is given to all the other
Members  at least  six  months  prior to the  last  day of the  Initial  Term or
Successor  Initial  Term  (as the  case may be) by the  Managing  Member  (a "MM
Termination  Notice")  or a Majority  of Class A Members (a "Non-MM  Termination
Notice").  Following  any such  additional  term,  the  Managing  Member's  term
automatically shall be extended for successive additional terms of two (2) years
each (any  additional  term,  whether  following  the Initial  Term, a Successor
Initial Term or an additional term,  being an "Additional  Term") unless written
notice of termination  of the Managing  Member is given to all the other Members
at least six months prior to the end of the then existing Additional Term by the
Managing Member or a Majority of Class A Members.

     (d)  Resignation.  The  Managing  Member shall not be entitled to resign or
withdraw  from its  position as Managing  Member prior to the end of the Initial
Term or any Successor  Initial Term or any Additional Term;  provided,  however,
that (i) the  Initial  Member may (x) upon thirty  (30) days  notice,  resign as
Managing Member after March 31, 2003 if, as of the date of such resignation, the
Transmission Service Date has not occurred and (y) may resign as Managing Member
as permitted  by Section  2.2(c) of the Master  Agreement  and (ii) the Managing
Member  shall  resign as  Managing  Member  (A) if  required  by the  Company in
accordance  with the  Operation  Agreement,  (B) if  required  under the  Master
Agreement,  (C) effective as of the time set forth in Section 6.1 (b) if removed
pursuant to such  Section  6.1(b)

                                       36

<PAGE>

unless,  in the case of either  clause (A) or clause (C),  the  Managing  Member
contests  its removal  under  Article X of this  Agreement or Article XII of the
Master  Agreement or Article VI of the  Operation  Agreement,  in which case the
Managing  Member shall  resign at the time  directed in any order or judgment of
the  arbitrator  issued  pursuant to such Article X of this Agreement or Article
XII of the Master  Agreement  or Article VI of the  Operation  Agreement,  if so
directed, or (D) as permitted pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Master Agreement.

     (e)  Replacement  of Managing  Member.  If a Member's  term as the Managing
Member ends (i) at the expiration of the Initial Term or Successor  Initial Term
because the Initial Term or Successor Initial Term is not automatically extended
to an  Additional  Term or (ii) at the end of any  Additional  Term because such
Additional Term is not automatically  extended to a subsequent  Additional Term,
then a Majority of Class A Members shall select the replacement  Managing Member
who may not be such Member or an Affiliate  thereof.  If the  Managing  Member's
Initial Term or Successor  Initial Term or any Additional  Term ends pursuant to
an Early Termination Event, a Super Majority of Transmission Owners shall select
the replacement Managing Member.

     (f)  Transitional  Provisions.  If a Person's term as Managing Member ends,
such Person  shall,  at the request of the  Company,  negotiate in good faith to
provide  transition  services on  commercially  reasonable  terms and conditions
(including  compensation) to facilitate a smooth transition of the management of
the Company.

     Section 6.2.  Redemption  of Units Upon  Termination  of Initial  Member as
Managing Member; Rights of the Company.

     (a)  Redemption  of  Units  Upon  Non-Renewal  of Term by  Members.  If the
Initial  Member's term as Managing  Member ends at the expiration of the Initial
Term because a Majority of Class A Members elect not to extend  automatically to
an Additional  Term or at the end of any  Additional  Term because a Majority of
Class A Members  elect not to extend  automatically  to a subsequent  Additional
Term, then the Initial Member may, by written notice delivered within sixty (60)
days after the end of the Initial Member's term as Managing Member,  require the
Company to redeem any Units  issued to and held by any  Affiliated  Investor  in
respect of Capital  Contributions  made pursuant to Sections 4.1 (a) and 4.1 (b)
(to the  extent  such  Units are still  held by an  Affiliated  Investor)  for a
redemption  price  equal to the Fair  Market  Value of such Units on the date of
delivery of the notice referred to above. Subject to Section 6.2(b), on the date
set forth in the  request for  redemption,  which date must be not more than one
hundred  eighty (180) days but not less than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the date of such  notice,  the  Company  shall  purchase  such  Units  from such
Affiliated  Investors and such Affiliated  Investors shall sell such Units, free
and clear of all  Encumbrances  for cash for their Fair  Market  Value,  and the
Managing  Member  shall  make  the  appropriate  notation  thereof  in the  Unit
Registry.  The right of  redemption  described in this Section  6.2(a) shall not
apply (i) to Units issued under any other provision of this Agreement other than
Sections 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), (ii) to Units held by any other Person other than the
Initial  Member and/or such  Affiliated  Investors,  (iii) upon a removal of the
Managing Member upon an Early Termination Event or if the Initial Member resigns
pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Master  Agreement or (iv) if the Initial  Member,
any  Affiliated  Investor  and/or any  Affiliate  thereof voted any of the Units
owned by them in favor of not  extending  the Initial  Member's term as Managing
Member.

                                       37

<PAGE>

     (b)  Conditions to Closing Redemption. In connection with any redemption of
Units by the Company  from any Person  pursuant to this  Agreement,  such Person
must deliver such Units to the Company on the date set for  redemption  free and
clear  of any  Encumbrances,  and  the  closing  of  such  redemption  shall  be
conditioned upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including (i)
execution  and  delivery  to the  Company  by such  Person of an  instrument  or
agreement  of  transfer  in form and  substance  reasonably,  satisfactory  to a
Majority of Non-Managing  Members and which contains  customary  representations
and warranties in respect of due  authorization,  title,  enforceability  and no
conflicts with agreements or applicable Laws and the need for any third-party or
Governmental  consents,  (ii) delivery to the Company of a Favorable  Opinion of
Counsel,  (iii) the redemption not violating any Laws or agreements to which the
Company or such Person is a party and (iv) receipt of any necessary  consents or
approvals of any Governmental Authorities.

     (c)  Acquisition of Managing Member's Assets and Employees.  If the Initial
Member  ceases  to be  the  Managing  Member  for  any  reason  (including  upon
resignation or removal if the Transmission  Service Date shall not have occurred
on or before  March 31,  2003),  the Company  shall have the right,  but not the
obligation,  to either (i) acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding
Equity  Interests  of the Initial  Member or one hundred  percent  (100%) of the
assets and  liabilities  of the Initial Member for a price equal to the Net Book
Value of the  Initial  Member  determined  as of the date on which  the  Initial
Member ceases to be Managing  Member or (ii) offer (or a designee of the Company
may offer) employment to any employee of the Initial Member, other than Excluded
Employees. The Company may exercise the rights granted by this Section 6.2(c) by
delivering notice within sixty (60) days of the date on which the Initial Member
ceases to be Managing Member.

     (d)  Closing of  Acquisition.  If the Company  elects to acquire the Equity
Interests or assets and  liabilities of the Initial  Member,  the Initial Member
shall cause such Equity Interests or assets and liabilities to be transferred to
the  Company  free and  clear of all  Encumbrances  (except,  in the case of the
assets of the  Initial  Member,  Encumbrances  that have been  disclosed  to the
Company), and the Initial Member shall cause NGUSA and the seller of such Equity
Interests to make  customary  representations  and  warranties in respect of due
authorization, title, enforceability, no conflicts with agreements or applicable
Laws,  the need for any third  party or  Governmental  consents  and  disclosing
material assets, contracts and liabilities.  The "Net Book Value" of the Initial
Member shall be the  difference,  but not less than zero,  between the aggregate
assets of the  Initial  Member  less the  aggregate  liabilities  of the Initial
Member,  both determined in accordance with GAAP. Any dispute  regarding the Net
Book  Value of the  Initial  Member  shall be finally  determined  by the Agreed
Accounting  Firm  designated  in  accordance  with  the  Master  Agreement.  The
acquisition  of the Equity  Interests  of the  Initial  Member or the assets and
liabilities  of the  Initial  Member by the  Company or its  designee  shall not
include any Units or Shares or any indebtedness incurred to acquire any Units or
Shares,  and (i)  immediately  prior to the  closing  of such  acquisition,  the
Initial Member shall  distribute or otherwise  transfer any Units or Shares held
by it to its  member(s)  or  shareholder(s)  (as the case may be) and  cause the
Initial  Member to be  released  from any  indebtedness  incurred to acquire any
Units or  Shares,  and shall  cause any  Encumbrances  on assets of the  Company
securing  acquisition  indebtedness  for such Units or Shares to be released and
(ii) any such Units or Shares and any such indebtedness shall not be included in
determining the Net Book Value of the Initial Member.

         (e) Hiring of Employees. If the Company or its designee elects to offer
employment to any employees of the Initial Member (or, in the case of a purchase
of the Equity  Interests of the Initial  Member,  if the Company or its designee
elects to retain the  services  of any such  employees),  it shall do so on such
terms  and  subject  to such  conditions  as it may  from  time  to time  elect;
provided, however, that no such offer shall be deemed to be a "Qualifying Offer"
with  respect to any such  employee  unless  such offer is made during the sixty
(60) day period referred to in Section 6.2(c),  and such offer offers employment
in a position  of  comparable  authority  with an overall  compensation  package
which, taken as a whole, is comparable to the overall  compensation package then
provided by the Initial Member.  During the sixty (60) day period referred to in
Section  6.2(c),  the Initial  Member  shall not,  and shall cause NGUSA and the
NGUSA  Affiliates  (other  than the  Company)  not to,  offer  employment  to or
otherwise  directly or  indirectly  retain or seek to retain the services of any
employee  of the  Initial  Member,  other than any  Excluded  Employee,  and the
Initial Member shall not, and shall cause NGUSA and the NGUSA Affiliates  (other
than the Company) not to, engage in any such activities. After the expiration of
such sixty (60) day period,  NGUSA and any NGUSA Affiliate may offer  employment
to any  employee  of the Initial  Member;  provided,  however,  that the Initial
Member shall not, and shall cause NGUSA and the NGUSA Affiliates (other than the
Company) not to, offer employment to or otherwise  directly or indirectly retain
or seek to retain the services of any employee of the Initial  Member other than
any Excluded  Employee who receives a Qualifying  Offer for a period of one year
after the date such  Qualifying  Offer is made.  The Company shall provide NGUSA
with copies of all  Qualifying  Offers of  employment  made to  employees of the
Initial  Member.  The  Initial  Member  shall have no  obligation  to retain any
employee  of the  Initial  Member as an  employee  after the  expiration  of the
Initial Member's term as Managing Member or the removal of the Initial Member as
Managing Member.

     (f)  Exercise of Rights of Company.  In the event that there are holders of
Class A Units other than NGUSA or  Affiliated  Investors at the time the Initial
Member ceases to be the Managing  Member,  then such holders shall represent the
interests of the Company in  connection  with the exercise by the Company of the
rights contained in Sections 6.2(c) through 6.2(e).  In the event that there are
no holders of Class A Units other than NGUSA or Affiliated  Investors,  then (i)
if the  Company  has  issued at least  $250,000,000  in Class B Units to Persons
other than the Initial  Member and/or its  Affiliates,  then the holders of such
Units shall  represent the  interests of the Company and (ii)  otherwise a Super
Majority of Transmission Owners may, if they so elect, by giving notice to NGUSA
and the Initial  Member  delivered  not fewer than  fifteen  (15) days after the
receipt of a MM Termination Notice, a Non-MM Termination Notice or the notice of
removal  delivered  pursuant to Section  6.1(b),  represent the interests of the
Company in connection  with the exercise by the Company of the rights  contained
in Sections 6.2(c) through 6.2(e) to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

     (g)  Consents and Approvals.  The Initial Member shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates  to, use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to obtain any  necessary
consents or approvals of any  Governmental  Authorities and of any third parties
in connection  with an acquisition  pursuant to Sections  6.2(c) through 6.2(e).
The Initial Member shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, enter into
or suffer to exist any agreement  that would  prohibit,  hinder or frustrate the
Company's rights under Sections 6.2(c) through 6.2(e); provided,  however, that,
the Company may enter into one or more  agreements in respect of financings  for
the Company that provide for aggregate  borrowings of not more than $100,000,000
prior to the date the Company first owns

                                       39

<PAGE>

GridAmerica  Transmission  Facilities  and  $250,000,000  thereafter,  unless  a
Majority  of  Non-Managing  Members  shall  have  approved  a greater  amount of
borrowings,  that  contain a covenant  prohibiting  a  change-in-control  of the
Managing  Member if the Initial  Member,  in the good faith  performance  of its
duties and  obligations as Managing  Member  determines that such provisions are
necessary in order to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms.

     Section 6.3.  Compensation of Managing Member; Expenses.


     (a)  General.  The Initial  Member,  commencing on the  Effective  Date and
continuing  until the end of the Initial Term,  shall be entitled to receive the

     Initial Term and $2.5 million for each  subsequent year of the Initial Term
     and each  year of any  Additional  Term  (the  "Initial  Management  Fee"),
     payable monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar month,
     subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6.3(b); and

          (ii) subject to Section  11.8(b),  reimbursement  of compensation  and

          (i)  the Initial Management Fee; plus

          (ii) the product of (A) the Initial Management Fee,  multiplied by the
     percentage  change,  if any,  in the CPI Index for  December of the year in

     value for the December immediately proceeding such January 1.

The annual management fee, if adjusted as aforesaid, shall remain unchanged
until it is adjusted again pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.3(b) or is
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or Section 6.3(d).

     (c)  Adjustment of Initial  Management Fee Upon Admission of New Members or

Transmission  Owners as parties to the Operation Agreement as agreed between the
Managing  Member  and such new  Member  or  party  to the  Operation  Agreement;
provided, however, that (i) no such increase in the Initial Management Fee shall
result in an increase in the  aggregate  amount of the  Initial  Management  Fee
payable by the Original GridAmerica Companies under Section 4.3 of the Operation
Agreement  without the consent of the Original  GridAmerica  Companies  and (ii)
after giving

                                       40

effect to such increase in the Initial Management Fee, the several obligation of
each Transmission Owner (under and as defined in the Operation Agreement) to pay
its pro rata share of the Initial  Management Fee pursuant to Section 4.3 of the
Operation  Agreement  shall not exceed a  percentage  of the  increased  Initial
Management Fee equal to the percentage that such Transmission  Owner's Net Plant
bears to the aggregate Net Plant in such year, adjusted to include the Net Plant
of the additional  Transmission  Owner as of the effective date of such increase
in the Initial Management Fee.

     (d)  Incentive Compensation. In addition to the amounts payable pursuant to
Sections  6.3(a),  (b) and (c),  the  Initial  Member  shall  receive  incentive
compensation pursuant to such incentive compensation  arrangements as are agreed
from time to time between the Initial Member and such of the other  participants
in GridAmerica ITC as shall agree thereto. Notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing,  any incentive  compensation  arrangements agreed between the Initial
Member and the other participants in GridAmerica ITC shall provide that not less

exercise of  Functional  Control over the  GridAmerica  Transmission  Facilities
pursuant to the Operation  Agreement  shall be payable to the Initial  Member as
incentive  compensation  and  the  balance  of  such  net  incentives  shall  be
distributed to the participants in GridAmerica ITC as set forth in Section 4.3.2
of the Operation Agreement.

     (e)  Prorated  Payments.  Any amounts  payable to the  Managing  Member for

actual number of days elapsed.

     (f)  Compensation of Successor  Managing  Member.  The  compensation of any
Managing  Member (other than the Initial Member as Managing  Member) shall be as
set forth in the instrument appointing such successor Managing Member.

     Section 6.4. Obligations of the Company.

     (a)  General. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall:

Members.

     (d)  Insurance. At all times during the effectiveness of this Agreement and
the Operation  Agreement,  the Company shall maintain insurance of the types and
in the  amounts as shall be agreed  between  the  Company  and the  Transmission

as aforesaid, the Company shall obtain such insurance provided such Transmission
Owner pays the cost thereof.

     (e)  Debt Securities.  Subject to Section  6.4(a)(v),  the Company may from

GridAmerica ITC  participants,  including,  without  limitation,  their electric
generation businesses and activities.

     Commission  orders and policies,  the Company shall execute and deliver and
     perform its obligations  under the MISO ITC Agreement  which  contemplates,

     Organizations  assumes  responsibility for any aspect of Functional Control
     of any Transmission  Facilities or for the operation thereof,  and it shall
     be an absolute  defense to any allegation of a breach by the Initial Member

     any similar agreement or under applicable Law.

notwithstanding,  the  approval  of a Super  Majority  of  Non-Managing  Members
referenced above shall not be required until such time as the Company has issued
an aggregate of  $250,000,000 in Units to Persons other than the Managing Member

provided in Section  6.8(c),  the Company  shall not enter into any agreement or
contract  with a Member,  an NDTO or any  Affiliate  thereof  providing  for the
provision of goods and/or  services to the Company  unless any such agreement or
contract  contains  in all  respects  terms  and  conditions  that  are no  less
favorable to the Company than could be obtained from a comparable,  unaffiliated
disinterested third party in a similar agreement or contract entered into by the
Company as the result of arm's-length negotiations with such third party.

     (c)  Contracts for Transitional Services.  Notwithstanding  Sections 6.8(a)

improper.  Except as expressly  provided herein,  no Member or Affiliate thereof
(other than the Managing  Member (but  including its  Affiliates  other than its
subsidiaries))   shall  be  obligated  to  present  any  particular   investment
opportunity to the Company even if such  opportunity is of a character which, if
presented  to the  Company,  could be taken by the  Company,  and any  Member or
Affiliate  thereof (other than the Managing Member (but including its Affiliates
other than its subsidiaries)),  shall have the right to take for its own account
(individually  or as a partner or  fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such
particular investment opportunity.

     Section 6.10. Power of Attorney.

     (a)  Power of Attorney.  Each Member  hereby  irrevocably  constitutes  and
appoints the Managing Member as its true and lawful  attorney-in-fact  and agent
of such Member, to execute,  acknowledge,  verify, swear to, deliver, record and
file, in its or its assignee's name, place and stead, all in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement,  all instruments,  documents and certificates that may,
from time to time be required by  applicable  Law to  effectuate,  implement and
continue the valid existence and affairs of the Company.

     (b)  Other  Provisions.  The power of attorney  granted pursuant to Section
6.10(a)  shall  terminate  upon the  bankruptcy or  dissolution  of the Managing
Member.  The power of  attorney  granted  pursuant to Section  6.10(a)  shall be
deemed to be coupled with an interest,  shall be irrevocable,  shall survive and
not be affected by the liquidation,  dissolution, bankruptcy or legal disability
of the Member or the transfer of all or any part of the Member's interest in the
Company and shall extend to its successors  and assigns;  and may be exercisable
by such  attorney-in-fact  and agent for the Member by listing the Member's name
on any such instrument and executing such instrument acting as attorney-in-fact.
Any person dealing with the Company may  conclusively  presume and rely upon the
fact that any instrument  referred to above,  executed by such  attorney-in-fact
and agent,  is authorized,  regular and binding,  without  further  inquiry.  If
required,  a Member shall  execute and deliver to the Managing  Member  promptly
after the receipt of a request therefor,  such further  designations,  powers of
attorney or other  instruments  as the  Managing  Member shall  reasonably  deem
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Section 6.10.

Agreement  in  accordance  with its  terms  to allow  the  Company  to  exercise
Functional  Control over the  Transmission  Facilities  of any other Person that
meets the requirements of this Section 6.14; provided,  however,  that the terms
of such  amendment  must  either (i) not be  materially  more  favorable  to the
counterparty  thereto  than the terms  applicable  to the  Original  GridAmerica
Companies  or (ii) the  Company  must  offer to make such more  favorable  terms
available  to all parties to the  Operation  Agreement  on a  non-discriminatory

Agreement  with  an  owner  of  Transmission  Facilities  that  is a  Non-Market
Participant on terms different than those set forth in the Operation  Agreement.
For any Person  other than a  GridAmerica  Company to be eligible to subject its
Transmission  Facilities to the Functional Control of the Company pursuant to an
Operation  Agreement,   (i)  the  Company  must  determine,  in  its  reasonable
discretion,  that subjecting the  Transmission  Facilities of such Person to the
Functional  Control  of the  Company  (x) will  not  result  in any  significant
detriment to the other parties to the Operation  Agreement in their  capacity as
such and (y) is likely to result in  long-term  benefits to the Company and (ii)
such Person must enter into an amendment  to the  Operation  Agreement  with the
Company in form and substance  satisfactory to the Managing Member.  Such Person

                     DISSOLUTION, WINDING-UP AND TERMINATION
                     ---------------------------------------

     Section 9.1. Dissolution.  The Company shall dissolve and its affairs shall
be wound, only upon the -----------  approval of the Managing Member and a Super
Majority of the Non-Managing Members.

     Section 9.2.  Winding-Up  and  Termination.  On the  occurrence of an event
described in Section 9.1, the Managing Member shall appoint a Person,  which may
be the Managing Member, to act as liquidator (the "Liquidator").  The Liquidator
shall  proceed  diligently  to wind up the affairs of the Company in  accordance
with this Section 9.2 and to make the final distributions described herein, with
the costs of winding up being borne as a Company  expense.  The Liquidator shall
have a  reasonable  period of time in which to conduct such winding up, in order
to facilitate an orderly liquidation of the Company's assets and to minimize any
losses  that may be caused by the sale of such  assets in  connection  with such
liquidation. The steps to be accomplished by the Liquidator are as follows:

          (i)  as  promptly as possible  after the  dissolution  and again after
     final winding up, the Liquidator shall cause a proper accounting to be made
     by a  recognized  firm of certified  public  accountants  of the  Company's
     assets,  liabilities  and  operations  through the last calendar day of the
     month in which the dissolution occurs or the final winding up is completed,
     as applicable;

                                       50

<PAGE>

          (ii) the Liquidator shall pay or discharge from Company funds, or make
     adequate  provisions  for the future  payment or  discharge  of, the debts,
     liabilities and obligations of the Company;

          (iii)the  Liquidator may sell any or all Company  property,  including
     to Members, and any resulting gain or loss from each sale shall be computed
     and  allocated to the Capital  Accounts of Members in  accordance  with the
     provisions of Section 5.1;

          (iv) with respect to all Company  property that has not been sold, the
     fair market  value of that  property  shall be  determined  and the Capital
     Accounts  of Members  shall be  adjusted to reflect the manner in which the
     unrealized income,  gain, loss, and deduction inherent in property that has
     not been reflected in the Capital  Accounts  previously  would be allocated
     among Members under Section 5.1 if there were a taxable disposition of that
     property  for the  fair  market  value  of  that  property  on the  date of
     distribution; and

          (v)  all remaining  assets of the Company shall be  distributed to the
     Members in accordance with Section 5.6(d). Such distributions shall be made
     by the end of the taxable year of the Company during which the  liquidation
     of the Company occurs (or, if later, ninety (90) days after the date of the
     liquidation);  provided,  however, that, in selling Transmission Facilities
     pursuant to Section  9.2(iii) and in distributing  Transmission  Facilities
     pursuant to this Section 9.2(v), in the event that the Liquidator  receives
     written  notice  from  a  Member  of  such  Member's  desire  to  reacquire
     Transmission  Facilities  previously  contributed  to the  Company  by such
     Member,  the Liquidator,  consistent with its other obligations  hereunder,
     shall endeavor to sell or distribute (as the case may be) such Transmission
     Facilities to such Member.

     All distributions in kind to Members shall be made subject to the liability
of each distributee for costs, expenses, and liabilities theretofore incurred or
for which the Company has committed  prior to the date of termination  and those
costs,  expenses, and liabilities shall be allocated to the distributee pursuant
to this  Section 9.2. The  distribution  of cash and/or  property to a Member in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.2 constitutes a complete return
to the Members of their Capital Contributions and a complete distribution to the
Members in respect of their Units and all the Company's property and constitutes
a compromise to which all Members have  consented  within the meaning of Section
18-502(b) of the Act. To the extent that a Member  returns funds to the Company,
it has no claim against any other Member for those funds.

     Section 9.3. Deficit Capital Accounts. No Member will be required to pay to
the  Company,  to any other  Member or to any other  Person any deficit  balance
which may exist from time to time in the Member's Capital Account.

     Section 9.4.  Certificate of  Cancellation.  On completion of the preceding
actions,  the  Managing  Member  shall  cause  to  be  filed  a  Certificate  of
Cancellation  with the Secretary of State of Delaware,  cancel any other filings
made pursuant to Section 2.5, and take such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the existence of the Company.

                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                               ------------------

     Section 10.1.  Negotiations.  If a dispute  between any two or more Parties
arises out of or relates to this Agreement, any such Party may notify each other
Party that it intends to initiate the dispute  resolution  procedures  set forth
herein.  Immediately  upon the  receipt of such  notice,  the Party  sending the
notice and each other Party  receiving  the notice shall refer such dispute to a
senior  executive  officer (the "SEOs") of each such Party for  consultation and
advice prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings.  The SEOs shall
meet in person or by teleconference as soon as mutually  practicable to consider
such  matters.  If the SEOs fail to resolve such dispute or  controversy  within
thirty (30) days of such notice being sent, any Party to the dispute may declare
the consultation procedure set forth in this Section 10.1 terminated,  whereupon
this dispute or controversy shall be referred to arbitration pursuant to Section
10.2.

     Section 10.2. Arbitration. Except as provided in Section 10.3, if a dispute
between any two or more Parties arises out of or relates to this Agreement or to
the relationship between the Parties created by this Agreement, and such Parties
have not successfully resolved such dispute through negotiation on or before the
thirtieth (30th) day following the notice referred to in Section 10.1, then such
dispute  shall be resolved  according to this Section  10.2.  If such dispute is
subject to the  jurisdiction  of the  Commission,  then any Party to the dispute
may,  within sixty (60) days of the notice  referred to in Section  10.1,  bring
such  dispute  before the  Commission  for  resolution.  If no Party  brings the
dispute before the Commission  within sixty (60) days of the notice  referred to
in Section  10.1,  or if the dispute is not subject to the  jurisdiction  of the
Commission,   then  such  dispute  shall  be  resolved  by  binding  arbitration
("Arbitration") under the following provisions.

     (a)  All Claims To Be  Arbitrated.  Except as provided  in the  immediately
preceding  sentence and in Sections 10.2(1),  11.8(a) and 11.15(a),  any and all
claims,  counterclaims,  demands, causes of action, disputes,  controversies and
other  matters in question  arising out of or  relating to this  Agreement,  any
provision  hereof,  the alleged  breach  hereof,  or in any way  relating to the
subject matter hereof or the  relationship  between the Parties  created hereby,
involving  the  Parties  ("Claims"),   shall  be  finally  resolved  by  binding
arbitration by a panel of arbitrators  under the  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules
(the "Arbitration Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") to
the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, regardless of
whether  some or all of such  Claims  allegedly  (i)  are  extra-contractual  in
nature,  (ii) sound in  contract,  tort,  or  otherwise,  (iii) are  provided by
federal or state  statute,  common law or  otherwise or (iv) seek damages or any
other relief, whether at law, in equity or otherwise.

     (b)  Referral of Claims to  Arbitration.  Subject to Section  10.1,  one or
more  Parties  may  refer a Claim  to  arbitration  (the  "Claimant  Party")  by
providing  notice  (an  "Arbitration  Notice")  to each  other  Party or Parties
against  which  the  Claim  is  asserted  (whether  one  or  more  parties,  the
"Respondent  Party")  in the  manner  set forth in the  Arbitration  Rules.  The
Arbitration  Notice must  include a general  description  of the Claim and shall
identify all Respondent  Parties and the reasons for asserting the Claim against
each Respondent  Party. The Arbitration is commenced  between the Claimant Party
and the Respondent Party ("Dispute  Parties") by sending the Arbitration  Notice
to the Respondent Party.

<PAGE>

     (c)  Stay  for  Commission   Proceedings;   Effect  of  Commission  Orders.
Following commencement of the Arbitration, if a Party other than a Dispute Party
institutes a proceeding  before the Commission  that involves one or more of the
Dispute  Parties  and the relief  sought in that  proceeding  would  require the
Commission  to  resolve  one or more  issues  presented  in the  Arbitration  (a
"Related Proceeding"), then the Dispute Parties agree that the Arbitration shall
be stayed during the pendency of such Related  Proceedings.  The Dispute Parties
further agree that the  Commission's  resolution in Related  Proceedings  of any
issue  that is also  presented  in the  Arbitration  shall be and is  final  and
binding as to that issue in the Arbitration.

     (d)  Number and Qualification of Arbitrators. The panel of arbitrators (the
"Panel") shall consist of three  arbitrators  appointed in accordance  with this
Section   10.2  and  the   Arbitration   Rules.   Arbitrators   shall  meet  the
qualifications  for arbitrators  established by the AAA and, in addition,  shall
have  significant   experience  in  the  electric  industry  and/or  significant
experience as an arbitrator in complex commercial matters. The arbitrators shall
each take an oath of neutrality.

     (e)  Appointment of Arbitrators.  By the fifteenth (15th) day following the
day on  which  the  Arbitration  Notice  is sent to the  Respondent  Party,  the
Claimant  Party shall  submit its  appointment  of the first  arbitrator  to the
Respondent  Party and the AAA. If the Claimant  Party  consists of more than one
Party,  then those Parties shall jointly  appoint the first  arbitrator.  By the
fifteenth  (15th) day following the  appointment  of the first  arbitrator,  the
Respondent  Party shall submit its  appointment of the second  arbitrator to the
Claimant  Party and the AAA. If the  Respondent  Party consists of more than one
Party, then those Parties shall jointly appoint the second  arbitrator.  The two
arbitrators  appointed by the Dispute Parties shall appoint a third  arbitrator,
who shall be the chairperson of the Panel, by the fifteenth (15th) day following
the appointment of the second arbitrator.  If the second arbitrator has not been
appointed by the fifteenth  (15th) day following  the  appointment  of the first
arbitrator,  or if the  first  two  arbitrators  have not  appointed  the  third
arbitrator by the fifteenth  (15th) day following the  appointment of the second
arbitrator,  any Dispute Party may request the AAA to appoint the  arbitrator(s)
in question.  If any arbitrator  resigns,  becomes  incapacitated,  or otherwise
refuses or fails to serve or to continue to serve as an arbitrator,  the Dispute
Party or  arbitrators  entitled to  designate  that  arbitrator  shall  promptly
designate a  successor.  In the event that either of the  Claimant  Party or the
Respondent  Party consist of more than one Party and those Parties are unable to
agree on the appointment of an arbitrator,  then all three  arbitrators shall be
appointed by the AAA; provided, however, that the arbitrators so appointed shall
meet the qualifications set forth in Section 10.2(d).

     (f)  Governing Law. In deciding the substance of the Parties'  Claims,  the
arbitrators  shall first rely upon the  provisions  of this  Agreement and shall
then apply the  substantive  laws governing  this Agreement  pursuant to Section
11.2.

     (g)  Powers of the  Arbitrators;  Limitations  On Remedies.  The  validity,
construction  and  interpretation  of  this  agreement  to  arbitrate,  and  all
procedural  aspects of the arbitration  conducted  pursuant to this agreement to
arbitrate,  including  the  determination  of the  issues  that are  subject  to
arbitration  (i.e.,   arbitrability),   the  scope  of  the  arbitrable  issues,
allegations  of "fraud in the  inducement"  to enter into this Agreement or this
arbitration provision, allegations of waiver, laches, delay or other defenses to
arbitrability, and the rules governing the conduct of the

arbitration (including the time for filing an answer, the time for the filing of
counterclaims,  the times for amending the  pleadings,  the  specificity  of the
pleadings,  the extent and scope of discovery,  the issuance of  subpoenas,  the
times for the  designation of experts,  whether the  arbitration is to be stayed
pending  resolution of related  litigation  involving third parties not bound by
this  arbitration  agreement,  the receipt of evidence  and the like),  shall be
decided by the arbitrators to the extent not provided for in this Article X. The
arbitrators  shall decide the Claims based on this  Agreement,  the  Arbitration
Rules, and the governing law, and not ex aqueo et bono, as amiable compositeurs,
or in  equity.  The  arbitrators  shall not have the power to award any of those
remedies  which are precluded by Section 11.8. The  arbitrators  shall also have
the power to enter such interim orders as they deem necessary,  including orders
to preserve the subject  matter of the Claim or to preserve or adjust the status
of  the  Parties  pending  resolution  of the  Claim  in  the  Arbitration.  The
chairperson  is  empowered  to  issue  interim  order  on his own  authority  in
emergency situations and where necessary to ensure the efficient  administration
of the  Arbitration  on  application  from a Dispute  Party,  which orders shall
remain in effect until a meeting of all  arbitrators may be convened to consider
the application.  The arbitrators  shall have the power to assess the attorneys'
fees (in accordance  with Section 11.9),  costs and expenses of the  Arbitration
(including  the  arbitrators'  fees  and  expenses)  against  one or more of the
Parties in whatever manner or allocation the arbitrators deem appropriate.

     (h)  Venue;  Procedural  Issues.  The seat of the Arbitration  shall be New
York,  New York,  or such other  place as the  Dispute  Parties  may agree.  The
arbitrators  shall set the date,  the time and the place of the  hearing,  which
must commence on or before the one hundred  twentieth  (120th) day following the
designation  of the third  arbitrator.  All  decisions of the three  arbitrators
shall be made by majority  vote. In  determining  the extent of  discovery,  the
number  and  length  of  depositions  and all  other  pre-hearing  matters,  the
arbitrators  shall  endeavor,   to  the  extent  possible,   to  streamline  the
proceedings and minimize the time and cost of the proceedings. There shall be no
transcript of the hearing.  The final hearing shall not exceed ten (10) business
days, with the Claimant Party and Respondent  Party each granted one-half of the
allocated time to present its case to the arbitrators. All proceedings conducted
hereunder and the decision of the arbitrators  shall be kept confidential by the
arbitrators, the AAA and any Persons participating in the Arbitration.

     (i)  Additional  Claims.  After the Arbitration has commenced and the Panel
has been  appointed,  if a further Claim arises under this Agreement that is not
successfully  settled  pursuant  to  Section  10.1,  and the  further  Claim (an
"Additional  Claim") is related to the Claim in the  Arbitration or involves the
same Dispute  Parties,  then any Party to the Additional Claim may ask the Panel
to  accept  jurisdiction  over  the  Additional  Claim  and  include  it in  the
Arbitration  by  submitting  an  Arbitration  Notice in the  manner set forth in
Section  10.2(b)  (an  "Additional   Arbitration   Request")  and  submitting  a
concurrent  request to the Panel to accept the  Additional  Claim.  The  Parties
agree that the Panel should accept  jurisdiction over an Additional Claim if the
resolution  of the Claim  before the Panel will  involve some or all of the same
legal and factual  issues  presented  by the  Additional  Claim or if  accepting
jurisdiction  over the  Additional  Claim would  facilitate or help minimize the
costs of resolving  the disputes at issue and not unduly delay the  Arbitration.
The Parties  agree,  however,  that the Panel alone shall  determine  whether it
should accept  jurisdiction  over an Additional Claim and that its determination
shall be final and  unappealable.  If the Panel  refuses  jurisdiction  over the
Additional  Claim,  then the Additional  Arbitration  Request shall constitute a
separate request for arbitration, which shall proceed

                                       54

<PAGE>

independently  and  under  this  Section  10.2 as if filed on the date the Panel
denied  the  request  to  accept  jurisdiction.  So long as there is no  pending
Additional Arbitration Request to the Panel to accept jurisdiction, any Party to
an Additional Claim may commence a separate arbitration proceeding in the manner
set forth in this Section 10.2.

     (j)  Arbitration  Awards.  The  arbitrators  shall render their award on or
before the thirtieth  (30th) day following the last session of the hearing fully
resolving all Claims that are the subject of the Arbitration. The award shall be
in writing,  shall give reasons for the  decision(s)  reached by the arbitrators
and shall be signed and dated by the arbitrators,  and a copy of the award shall
be delivered to each of the Dispute  Parties.  A Party  against  which the award
assesses a monetary  obligation  or enters an  injunctive  order  shall pay that
obligation or comply with that order on or before the thirtieth  (30th) calendar
day  following  the  receipt of the award or by such other date as the award may
provide.  Any award of the arbitrators  shall be consistent with the limitations
and terms of this  Agreement.  The  arbitrators'  award may be confirmed in, and
judgment  upon the award  entered  by, any court  having  jurisdiction  over the
Parties.

     (k)  Binding Nature.  The decisions of the  arbitrators  shall be final and
binding on the Parties and  non-appealable  to the maximum  extent  permitted by
Law.

     (l)  Assistance  of  Courts.  It is the  intent  of the  Parties  that  the
Arbitration  shall be conducted  expeditiously,  without initial recourse to the
courts and without  interlocutory  appeals of the arbitrators'  decisions to the
courts.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, however, a Party
may seek court assistance in the following circumstances: (i) if a Party refuses
to honor its obligations under this agreement to arbitrate,  any other Party may
obtain   appropriate   relief   compelling   arbitration  in  any  court  having
jurisdiction over the refusing Party, and the order compelling arbitration shall
require that the arbitration proceedings take place in Washington,  D.C., and in
the  manner  specified  herein,  (ii) a Dispute  Party may apply to any state or
federal court having relevant  jurisdiction  for orders  requiring  witnesses to
obey subpoenas issued by the arbitrators,  including  requests for documents and
(iii) a Party may apply at any time  before or  during  the  Arbitration  to any
court having relevant  jurisdiction  for an order preserving the status quo ante
and/or  evidence  in  anticipation  of  arbitration  (for  avoidance  of  doubt,
preservation  of the status quo ante  includes  an order  compelling  a Party to
continue to fulfill an obligation under this Agreement or to refrain from taking
an action that would  constitute  a default  under this  Agreement;  for further
avoidance  of doubt,  such an  application  to the courts is not intended to and
does not constitute waiver of the right to arbitrate  Claims,  nor does it refer
any Claim to court for  decision).  The Parties agree to comply with any interim
order  issued  by the  arbitrators  or by the  chairperson.  Any  and all of the
arbitrators' orders and decisions,  including interim orders, may be enforced by
any  state  or  federal  court  having  jurisdiction.  Each  Party  agrees  that
arbitration  pursuant to this  Section  10.2 shall be the  exclusive  method for
resolving  all Claims  and that it will not  commence  an action or  proceeding,
except as provided in this Section 10.2.

     Section 10.3.  Arbitration of Certain Claims Regarding  Removal of Managing
Member.  If a Super  Majority of  Transmission  Owners  shall have  attempted to
remove the  Managing  Member for Cause  pursuant to Section  6.1(b)(ii)  of this
Agreement,  and the Managing Member disputes whether Cause for removal exists (a
"Removal  Claim"),  then the issue of whether Cause exists  immediately shall be
referred  to  and  resolved  by  binding  arbitration  ("Removal

                                       55

<PAGE>

Arbitration") according to this Section 10.3. The Removal Claim shall be finally
resolved by one  arbitrator  appointed in accordance  with this Section 10.3 and
the Arbitration Rules to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement.  The  Expedited  Procedures  of the  Arbitration  Rules shall be used
unless  the  arbitrator  determines  that  they  would  be  inappropriate.   The
arbitrator shall take an oath of neutrality.

     (a)  Application  to Removal Claim;  Relation to Other Claims.  Any dispute
other than a Removal Claim must be resolved in a separate  Arbitration  pursuant
to Section 10.2. A Removal Arbitration may not be joined to or consolidated with
an Arbitration without the consent of all parties in the Removal Arbitration and
the  Arbitration(s).  The decision of the arbitrator on a Removal Claim shall be
final and conclusive and bind any arbitrators in an Arbitration  commenced under
Section 10.2.

     (b)  Referral of Claims to  Arbitration.  A Managing  Member who receives a
written  notice of removal as  contemplated  in Section  6.1(b)(ii)  (a "Removal
Notice"),  and who  disputes  that Cause for removal  exists or a Member or NDTO
upon  receipt of notice from the  Managing  Member  that it disputes  that Cause
exists  (the  "Removal  Claimant"),   may  refer  a  Removal  Claim  to  Removal
Arbitration by providing notice (a "Notice of Removal  Dispute") to the Managing
Member, all Members and all NDTOs that are not the Removal Claimant (whether one
or more parties, the "Removal Respondent Party"), in the manner set forth in the
Arbitration  Rules.  The Notice of Removal  Dispute  also must contain a list of
five (5) proposed arbitrators.  The Removal Arbitration is commenced between the
Removal Claimant and the Removal Respondent Party ("Removal Dispute Parties") by
sending the Notice of Removal Dispute to the Removal Respondent Party.

     (c)  Appointment  of  Arbitrator.  Within ten (10) days of  delivery of the
Notice of Removal  Dispute,  the Removal  Respondent  Party shall deliver to the
Removal  Claimant  and the AAA a list of five (5) proposed  arbitrators.  If the
lists  provided by the Removal  Claimant and the Removal  Respondent  Party both
contain  a  common  proposed  arbitrator,  such  person  shall  be  selected  as
arbitrator;  otherwise,  the AAA shall appoint the  arbitrator  according to the
procedures  contained  in the  Arbitration  Rules.  If the  arbitrator  resigns,
becomes incapacitated,  or otherwise refuses or fails to serve or to continue to
serve as an arbitrator,  the Removal Dispute Parties shall promptly  designate a
successor  using the procedures  established in this Section 10.3. An arbitrator
appointed  pursuant  to this  Section  10.3(c) may not also be  appointed  as an
arbitrator pursuant to Section 10.2.

     (d)  Governing  Law. In deciding the substance of the Removal  Claims,  the
arbitrator shall first rely upon the provisions of this Agreement and shall then
apply the substantive laws governing this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3.

     (e)  Powers of the Arbitrators;  Limitations On Remedies. The arbitrator in
a Removal  Arbitration  shall decide solely the Removal Claim, and shall have no
power to decide any other Claim.  The arbitrator  shall decide the Removal Claim
based on this Agreement,  the Arbitration  Rules, and the governing law, and not
ex aqueo et bono, as amiable  compositeur,  or in equity.  The arbitrator  shall
have the power to assess the attorneys' fees (in accordance with Section 11.11),
costs and expenses of the Removal  Arbitration  (including the arbitrators' fees
and

                                       56

<PAGE>

expenses)  against one or more of the Parties in whatever  manner or  allocation
the arbitrator deems appropriate.

     (f)  Venue; Procedural Issues. The seat of the Removal Arbitration shall be
New York,  New York,  or such other  place as the  Removal  Dispute  Parties may
agree. The arbitrator shall set the date, the time and the place of the hearing,
which  must  commence  on or before  the  thirtieth  (30th)  day  following  the
appointment of the arbitrator.  There shall be no transcript of the hearing. The
final hearing shall not exceed ten (10) business days, with the Removal Claimant
and Removal  Respondent  Party each granted  one-half of the  allocated  time to
present its case to the arbitrator.  All proceedings conducted hereunder and the
decision of the arbitrator shall be kept confidential by the arbitrator, the AAA
and any Persons participating in the Removal Arbitration.

     (g)  Arbitration Awards. The arbitrator shall render his award on or before
the tenth (10th) day following the  hearing(s) on the Removal  Claim.  The award
shall be in writing, shall give a reasonably detailed description of the reasons
for the  decision(s)  reached by the arbitrator and shall be signed and dated by
the  arbitrator,  and a copy of the  award  shall  be  delivered  to each of the
Removal Dispute  Parties.  Any award of the arbitrator  shall be consistent with
the  limitations  and terms of this  Agreement.  The  arbitrator's  award may be
confirmed  in,  and  judgment  upon the  award  entered  by,  any  court  having
jurisdiction over the Parties.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                     GENERAL
                                     -------

     Section 11.1. Not for Benefit of Third Parties.  This Agreement is intended
to be solely for the benefit of the  Members,  their  successors  and  permitted
assignees, and is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or benefits on
any Person not a signatory hereto.

     Section  11.2.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THE VALIDITY  AND  INTERPRETATION  OF THIS
AGREEMENT  SHALL BE  GOVERNED  BY THE LAWS OF THE  STATE  OF  DELAWARE,  WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES  THEREOF,  EXCEPT THAT THE TERMS GROSS
NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT  SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     Section  11.3.  Effect of Waiver.  No waiver by a Member of any one or more
defaults  by another  party  hereto or the  Company in the  performance  of this
Agreement  shall  operate or be construed  as a waiver of any future  default or
defaults, whether of alike or different character.

     Section 11.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which  shall be  deemed an  original,  but all of which  together  shall
constitute one and the same instrument,  notwithstanding that all of the Members
are not signatories to the original or to the same counterpart.

     Section 11.5.  Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the entire
agreement  between the Members and the Company  pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,  representations and understandings,
written or oral,  pertaining  thereto,

                                       57

<PAGE>

including  that  certain  letter of intent dated as of June 20, 2002 among NGUSA
and the Original GridAmerica Companies.

     Section  11.6.  Severability.  Any  provision  of  this  Agreement  that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of that  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof or  affecting  the  validity or
enforceability of that provision in any other jurisdiction.

     Section 11.7. Notices. Every notice, request, or other statement to be made
or  delivered  to a Member or the Company  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be
directed to such Member's  representative at the address or facsimile number for
such Member set forth on Schedule A or to such other address or facsimile number
as the Member may  designate  by written  notice to the  Company  and each other
Member  from time to time.  All  notices  or other  communications  required  or
permitted to be given  pursuant to this Agreement must be in writing and will be
considered  as  properly   given  if  sent  by  facsimile   transmission   (with
confirmation  notice sent by first class mail,  postage  prepaid),  by reputable
nationwide   overnight  delivery  service  that  guarantees  next  business  day
delivery, by personal delivery,  or, if mailed from within the United States, by
first class United States mail,  postage  prepaid,  registered or certified with
return receipt requested.  Any notice hereunder will be deemed to have been duly
given  (i) on the date  personally  delivered,  (ii) when  received,  if sent by
certified or registered mail,  postage prepaid,  return receipt  requested or if
sent by overnight delivery service; and (iii) if sent by facsimile transmission,
on the date sent,  provided  confirmation  notice is sent by  first-class  mail,
postage prepaid promptly thereafter.

     Section 11.8. Remedies; Limitation on Damages; Indemnification.

     (a)  Specific  Performance.  The  Members  agree that a default  under this
Agreement will result in irreparable  damage to the  non-defaulting  Members for
which no money damages  could  adequately  compensate.  In addition to all other
remedies  to  which  the  non-defaulting  Members  may  be  entitled,  including
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses  pursuant  to Section  11.9 and court
costs, any non-defaulting  Member shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or
specific performance to restrain or compel the defaulting Member or the Company.
Each of the Members and the Company  expressly waives any claim that an adequate
remedy at law exists for such a breach.

     (b)  Remedies Upon Early Termination  Event. If a Managing Member ceases to
serve as Managing  Member,  the Managing  Member shall forfeit,  and the Company
shall not be obligated to pay, the unearned  amount of the Management Fee or any
incentive compensation.

     (c)  All Other Remedies. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to
be exclusive  of any other  available  right or remedy,  but each and every such
right or remedy  shall be  cumulative  and shall be in  addition  to every other
right or remedy given  hereunder or hereafter  existing  under law or in equity.
The  exercise of any one right or remedy shall not be deemed an election of such
right or remedy or  preclude  the  exercise  of any other  right or remedy.  The
resort to any right or remedy  provided  for herein or provided for by law or in
equity shall not prevent the  concurrent or  subsequent  employment of any other
right or remedy.

                                       58

<PAGE>

     (d)  Limitation on Damages.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to
the contrary:

          (i)  No  Person  shall be liable  under  this  Agreement  to any other
     Person for indirect, consequential,  special or punitive damages on account
     of any action or proceeding brought hereunder or related hereto; and

          (ii) The Managing  Member shall be liable under this Agreement only as
     provided  in  Section  11.8(e)  or in the case of the Gross  Negligence  or
     Willful Misconduct of the Managing Member.

     (e)  Indemnification by Managing Member.

          (i)  The Managing Member shall indemnify and hold harmless each Member
     from all Damages  suffered or incurred by such Member and arising out of or
     caused by any  breach by the  Managing  Member of  Section  6.5;  provided,
     however,  that,  except as  hereinafter  provided,  the Initial  Member (as
     Managing  Member)  shall not be liable for Damages from any claim or series
     of related claims involving a breach of Section 6.5 (i) unless such Damages
     exceed  $150,000  in the  aggregate,  and then only to the extent that such
     Damages  exceed  $150,000  or (ii) if and to the  extent  that the  Damages
     arising  from any  claim or  series  of  related  claims  occurring  in any
     calendar year plus all Managing  Member  Payments with respect to all other
     claims  occurring in such  calendar year are greater than the Liability Cap
     Amount for such calendar year.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  none of the
     limitations on liability  contained in this Section  11.8(e)(i) shall apply
     in  respect  of any  Damages  arising  out of Gross  Negligence  or Willful
     Misconduct (and the Managing Member shall be fully liable for any breach of
     any  provision  of  this  Agreement  arising  out  of or  caused  by  Gross
     Negligence or Willful  Misconduct or breaches by the Managing Member of its
     obligations  under Section 4.1 or 4.2). To the extent that a claim asserted
     against the Managing  Member  relates to Damages  suffered by more than one
     Member,  then the Member that  asserted  such claim and such other  Members
     shall share the  indemnification  payments  made by the Managing  Member in
     respect thereof in proportion to the Damages suffered by each.

          (ii) For the  avoidance of doubt,  the  Managing  Member shall have no
     indemnification obligation under Section 11.8(e)(i) with respect to Damages
     arising out of any claim  occurring in any calendar year involving any Good
     Business  Practice  Breach to the extent that the amount of such Damages in
     respect of such claim plus all Managing Member Payments with respect to all
     other claims  occurring in such calendar year is greater than the Liability
     Cap Amount for such calendar year.

     (f)  "Managing Member  Payments" means,  with respect to any calendar year,
the sum of the following determined as of the time in question:

          (i)  the aggregate  amount of all  indemnification  payments  actually
     made by the Managing Member under Section  11.8(e)(i)  (excluding  payments
     made out of insurance  proceeds)  with respect to claims  occurring in such
     calendar year with respect to breaches of Sections  6.5(i),  (ii), (iv) and
     (v) ("Good Business Practice Breaches"); plus

                                       59

<PAGE>

          (ii) the  aggregate  amount of all  Damages  actually  paid or due and
     payable by the Managing  Member  (excluding  payments made out of insurance
     proceeds and excluding the application of any indemnification payments from
     the Company  pursuant to Section  11.8(h)(ii))  with respect to Third Party
     Claims  (other than claims by the Members  pursuant to Section  11.8(e)(i))
     occurring  in such  calendar  year to the extent such claims  involve  Good
     Business Practice Breaches;

provided,  however,  that no amount paid by the  Managing  Member as a result of
Gross  Negligence  or Willful  Misconduct  shall  constitute  a Managing  Member
Payment and no amount paid to any Person, other than amounts paid to a Protected
Member in its capacity as Protected  Member,  shall constitute a Managing Member
Payment.  For purposes of determining the amount of the Managing Member Payments
in respect of any  calendar  year,  a claim shall be deemed to have  occurred in
such calendar year if the facts,  circumstances  or events which first gave rise
to Damages occurred during such calendar year,  regardless of when the claim was
asserted or when any particular element of such Damages was incurred.

     (g)  Notice,  Joinder of Claims.  Any Member  asserting a claim for damages
against the Company or the Managing Member shall,  promptly after the initiation
of  such  claim,   give  notice  thereof  to  the  other  Members  and  to  each
Non-Divesting  Transmission  Owner,  which  notice  must  include  a  reasonably
detailed  description  of the basis for such claim.  The Company and each Member
agree that if any NDTO  asserts a claim  against the Company  arising out of the
same  facts and  circumstances  that  give  rise to the  claim by the  Member or
Members  asserting  a claim  against  the  Managing  Member  pursuant to Section
11.8(e),  such claim may,  at the written  request of such NDTO  received by the
Company  within thirty (30) days of the date on which such NDTO received  notice
of the  initiation of such claim,  be  consolidated  with, and determined in the
same proceeding as the claim for indemnity  asserted against the Managing Member
pursuant to Section 11.8(e).

     (h)  Indemnification by the Company.

          (i)  Except as otherwise  provided with respect to the Managing Member
     pursuant to Section 11.8(e)(i), no Member or former Member shall be liable,
     accountable or  responsible  for Damages or otherwise to the Company or the
     other  Members  for any action  taken or failure to act to the extent  such
     action  is taken or such  failure  to act was made by such  Member  in good
     faith on behalf  of the  Company  and  within  the  scope of the  authority
     conferred on the Member by this  Agreement or by Law unless any such action
     or omission,  was  performed or omitted in bad faith or  constituted  Gross
     Negligence or Willful Misconduct.

          (ii) The  Company  shall,  but  only  to the  extent  of  its  assets,
     indemnify and hold harmless each Member (including the Managing Member) and
     each officer,  director,  employee,  partner or controlling  person of each
     Member  (collectively,  the  "Indemnified  Parties")  from and  against any
     Damages paid or due and payable to a third-party  and reasonable  costs and
     expenses of  defending  any claim by any  third-party  that are suffered or
     sustained  by such  Indemnified  Party  and  resulting  from any claim by a
     third-party  by reason of any acts,  omissions or alleged acts or omissions
     arising out of such Member's activities as a Member ("Third Party Claims"),
     including as Managing Member;

                                       60

<PAGE>

     provided, however, such indemnity does not extend to Damages arising out of
     any action or inaction of the Member or Indemnified  Party (i) taken in bad
     faith or (ii) that constitutes Gross Negligence or Willful  Misconduct or a
     breach of Section 4.1 or 4.2. Additionally, and notwithstanding anything to
     the  contrary,  the  Company  shall have no  obligation  to  indemnify  the
     Managing Member with respect to any Third Party Claim occurring in any year
     involving any Good Business  Practice Breach to the extent the Damages paid
     or due and  payable by the  Managing  Member in respect of such Third Party
     Claim plus all  Managing  Member  Payments  with  respect  to other  claims
     occurring in such  calendar year are less than the Liability Cap Amount for
     such calendar year.

          (iii)The  Company  shall have the right to assume  the  defense in any
     action or claim with  respect to which it is  indemnifying  an  Indemnified
     Party hereunder.

     (j)  Survival. The obligations of a Person who ceases to be Managing Member
shall  survive such Person's  resignation  or removal with respect to any claims
arising prior to such Person's resignation or removal.

     Section 11.9. Attorneys' Fees. In any dispute arising hereunder,  the party
prevailing at final  judgment  shall be entitled to recover from the other party
all of its reasonable  attorneys'  fees and costs incurred in such a proceeding,
in addition to any affirmative or injunctive relief that it may receive.

     Section  11.10.  Time is of the  Essence.  Time is of the  essence  of each
provision of this Agreement.

     Section 11.11. Amendments to this Agreement.

     (a)  General.  This  Agreement  may  be  amended,   modified  or  otherwise
supplemented  upon the  affirmative  approval  of a Majority of Class A Members;
provided,  however, that the foregoing  notwithstanding,  in no event shall this
Agreement  (i) be amended,  modified or  otherwise  supplemented  to require any
Member to make any additional  Capital  Contribution to the Company without that
Member's  prior  written  consent,  (ii)  be  amended,   modified  or  otherwise
supplemented  (or any  provision  hereof  be  waived)  in a  manner  that  would
adversely  affect a Member's  preferences  or rights as a Member in any material
respect (including any rights to  indemnification) or the effect of which (A) is
that the  Company  is able to enter into or engage in a  transaction,  contract,
agreement or arrangement  that would have  contravened  this Agreement  prior to
such  amendment or (B) impairs the ability to carry out the Permitted  Purposes,
unless, in each such case, the affirmative  written approval of a Super Majority
of  Non-Managing  Members is obtained prior to such amendment or waiver or (iii)
be amended,  modified or  otherwise  supplemented  (or any  provision  hereof be
waived) that would alter the rights or obligations of the Managing Member solely
in its capacity as Managing  Member without the  affirmative  written consent of
the Managing Member.

tax  returns,  and other  documents  as may be  required  of the  Company or its
Members  by the Laws of the  United  States  or any  jurisdiction  in which  the

     Section 11.15. Fair Market Value.

     (a)  Valuation  Procedure.  Whenever used in this  Agreement,  "Fair Market
Value" means,  with respect to the valuation of any property,  the value of such
property at the time in question as determined  in good faith by the  interested
parties;  provided,  however, that if such parties fail to agree in writing upon
the value of such property  before the earlier of (i) twenty

                                       62

<PAGE>

(20) days after the first request to make such a determination  or (ii) the date
sixty (60) days prior to the  transaction in question,  then the following shall
apply:

          (i)  Each  interested  party  shall  select  a  nationally  recognized
     investment  banking  firm to make  such  determination  on such  interested
     party's behalf in accordance with the standards, procedures and assumptions
     set forth in this Section 11.15. Each interested party shall pay all of the
     fees and expenses of the investment  banking firm selected by it (each such
     firm being  referred to as an  "Interested  Party  Valuation  Firm").  Each
     interested  party  promptly  shall  make  available  to each  other and any
     investment  banking firms  involved in such process such  information as is
     reasonably  necessary  to reach a Fair  Market  Value  determination.  Each
     Interested  Party  Valuation Firm shall  determine its proposed fair market
     value of the property being valued.

          (ii) If the proposed fair market values  determined by the  Interested
     Party  Valuation  Firms are within  10% of each  other,  then "Fair  Market
     Value" shall mean the average of such proposed fair market values.

          (iii)If the proposed fair market values  determined by the  Interested
     Party Valuation Firms are not within 10% of each other, then the Interested
     Party Valuation Firms shall select a third nationally recognized investment
     banking  firm  (the  "Neutral  Valuation  Firm"),  which  shall be paid for
     equally by both  interested  parties.  (If the Interested  Party  Valuation
     Firms fail to appoint a Neutral  Valuation  Firm within twenty (20) days of
     the date the last of the  Interested  Party  Valuation  Firms  rendered its
     opinion of fair market value, then either interested party may apply to any
     court or arbitration panel having  jurisdiction to make such  appointment.)
     The Neutral  Valuation  Firm shall also propose a fair market value for the
     property being valued. If:

               (a)  the fair market value proposed by the Neutral Valuation Firm
          is higher than the fair  market  values  proposed  by both  Interested
          Party Valuation Firms,  then "Fair Market Value" shall mean the higher
          of the  two  fair  market  values  proposed  by the  Interested  Party
          Valuation Firms;

               (b)  the  proposed  fair market value  determined  by the Neutral
          Valuation  Firm is lower than the fair market values  proposed by both
          Interested Party Valuation Firms,  then "Fair Market Value" shall mean
          the lower of the two fair market  values  proposed  by the  Interested
          Party Valuation Firms; and

               (c)  the fair market value proposed by the Neutral Valuation Firm
          is between the fair market values  proposed by both  Interested  Party
          Valuation  Firms,  then "Fair Market Value" shall mean the fair market
          value proposed by the Neutral Valuation Firm.

          (iv) In any case  where an  investment  banking  firm is  required  to
     render an opinion of fair  market  value,  such  opinion  shall be rendered
     within 30 days of being engaged.

                                       63

     (b)  General  Principles of  Application.  The following  principles  shall
apply  generally  to any  determination  of "fair market  value"  under  Section
11.15(a),  whether such determination is made by the interested parties or by an
investment banking firm:

          (i)  Fair market  value shall mean the price at which the  property in
     question  would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing  seller,
     neither being under any compulsion and both having reasonable  knowledge of
     the relevant facts,  including the relevant  regulatory policies and, where
     the item in  question  is an  interest,  or a group of  assets  used,  in a
     business, such item shall be valued based on its going-concern value.

          (ii) Any  expected tax  benefits of either  interested  party shall be
     considered in determining fair market value.

          (iii)In  computing  the fair market value of a Unit or group of Units,
     such values  shall be  determined  by reference to the fair market value of
     the Company and the  presence or absence of voting or control  rights shall
     be ignored.

          (iv) All property will be valued on a stand-alone basis without regard
     to any expected cost savings or other synergies resulting from any proposed
     transaction.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (i) if as a  result  of the
     failure of a Putting  GridAmerica  Company  to  include in its  Contributed
     Transmission Facilities all Transmission Facilities necessary or reasonably
     appropriate  to operate  the  Contributed  Transmission  Facilities  in the
     manner in which such  Transmission  Facilities  were  operated  immediately
     prior to the  determination  of the fair market value of such  Transmission
     Facilities, the cost to the Company of replacing those omitted Transmission
     Facilities shall be taken into account in determining Fair Market Value and
     (ii) the  economic  and  operational  effect of any  assets or  contractual
     arrangements for the provision of services offered by a Putting GridAmerica
     Company in  connection  with the  exercise  of any Put Right shall be taken
     into  account  in  determining  the fair  market  value of any  Contributed
     Transmission Facilities.

     (c)  Participation  by Managing  Member.  When the Fair Market  Value to be
determined is in connection  with a contribution of assets to the Company by the
Managing  Member or one of its  Affiliates,  the Members other than the Managing
Member and its Affiliates  acting  collectively  will represent the interests of
the Company in such valuation process.

     Section 11.16. Late Payments.  If a Party does not pay within ten (10) days
of the date  required  hereunder,  all or any portion of an amount such Party is
required  to pay as provided  in this  Agreement  then (i) the amount such owing
Party is  required  to pay shall bear  interest  at (A) the sum of (I) a varying
rate per annum that is equal to the interest  rate  publicly  quoted by The Wall
Street Journal,  from time to time as the prime commercial or similar  reference
interest rate with  adjustments in that varying rate to be made on the same date
as any  change  in that  rate  plus  (II) 2% per  annum or (B) such  lower  rate
required under  applicable  law,  compounded  annually and (ii) a Party to which
payment is due may take any  action,  at the cost and expense of the owing Party
to obtain  payment by such  owing  Party of the  portion  of such owing  Party's
payment that is in default, together with interest thereon as provided above.
