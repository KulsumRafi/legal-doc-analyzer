follows:

         1.  Amendments.

                  (a) Section 1 of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended
         and restated in its entirety as follows:

                           "1. Employment Period. Subject to Section 3 hereof,
         the Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive
         hereby agrees to be employed by the Company, in accordance with the
         terms and provisions of this Agreement, for the period commencing as of
         the date of this Agreement and continuing until January 1, 2004;
         provided, however, that such Employment Period shall be extended for
         successive terms of one (1) year each unless either party advises the
         other, at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of the
         initial term or annual extension, as the case may be, that it will not
         agree to extend this Agreement (the "Employment Period")."

                  (b) Section 2(b)(i) of the Employment Agreement is hereby and
         restated in its entirety as follows:

                           "(i) Base Salary. During the Employment Period, the
         Executive shall receive, at such intervals and in accordance with such
         Company policies as may be in effect from time to time, an annual
         salary (pro rata for any partial year) equal to $300,000, payable in
         equal installments no less often than monthly (the "Annual Base
         Salary"), which Annual Base Salary shall be subject to appropriate
         increase, as determined by the sole discretion of the Board of
         Directors of the Company."

         2.  Certain Definitions.  Capitalized terms used without definition in
