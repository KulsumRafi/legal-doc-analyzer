time pursuant to Section&nbsp;5 hereof (the "Warrant Price"), subject to the provisions and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and callable by the Company upon the terms and
conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;l hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

hereafter be converted or exchanged. </FONT></P>

or combination), or in case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation, other than a Merger with another corporation in which the Company is a continuing
corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the Company, or such successor, as the case may be, shall
execute a new Warrant, providing that the Holder of this Warrant shall have the right to exercise such new Warrant and procure upon such exercise, in lieu of each share of Common Stock theretofore
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, or merger by a Holder
of one share of Common Stock; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company may determine that, upon the occurrence of any of the following listed events, this Warrant will become
immediately exercisable, in whole or in part, on such date of occurrence and if unexercised, in whole or in part, by the Holder, will thereupon terminate: (i)&nbsp;a stockholder approved dissolution
or liquidation of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;a stockholder approved sale of substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets to a person or entity that is not a subsidiary or affiliate of the
Company; or (iii)&nbsp;any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into one or more entities that are not subsidiaries or other affiliates of the Company where the Company does not survive.
Any new Warrant shall provide for adjustments, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section&nbsp;5. The provisions of this subparagraph
(a)&nbsp;shall similarly apply to successive reclassification, changes, consolidations, and mergers. </FONT></P>
