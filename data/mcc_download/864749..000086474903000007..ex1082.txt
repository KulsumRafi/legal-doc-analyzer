         obligations  hereunder  to make its  Tranche C  Revolving  Loan on such

         any Swing Line Loan, that any applicable  condition precedent set forth
         in  Sections  5.1,  5.2 and  5.3,  as  applicable,  had not  then  been
         satisfied,  such Lender's  obligation to make Tranche C Revolving Loans
         pursuant  to this  Section  2.3(d) to repay  Swing Line Loans  shall be
         unconditional,  continuing,  irrevocable  and absolute and shall not be
         affected by any circumstances,  including,  without limitation, (a) any
         set-off,  counterclaim,  recoupment,  defense or other right which such
         Lender may have against the  Administrative  Agent, the Swing Line Bank
         or any other Person, (b) the failure to satisfy any condition set forth
         herein or the  occurrence  or  continuance  of a Default  or  Unmatured
         Default,  (c)  any  adverse  change  in  the  condition  (financial  or
         otherwise) of the Company, or (d) any other circumstances, happening or
         event whatsoever. In the event that any Lender fails to make payment to
         the  Administrative  Agent of any amount due under this Section 2.3(d),
         the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, retain and apply
         against such obligation the principal and interest otherwise payable to
         such Lender  hereunder  until the  Administrative  Agent  receives such
         payment  from  such  Lender  or  such  obligation  is  otherwise  fully
         satisfied.  In addition to the foregoing,  if for any reason any Lender
         fails to make  payment  to the  Administrative  Agent of any amount due
         under this Section  2.3(d) or may not make any Revolving  Loan required
         by this Section 2.3, such Lender shall be deemed,  at the option of the
         Administrative  Agent or the Swing Line Bank,  to have  unconditionally
         and irrevocably purchased from the Swing Line Bank, without recourse or
         warranty,  an undivided  interest and  participation  in the Swing Line
         Loan in the  amount  of such  Revolving  Loan,  and such  interest  and
         participation  shall be paid by such  Lender  upon  demand by the Swing
         Line Bank together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate for each day during the  period  commencing  on the date of demand

         Revolving  Loan  Termination  Date, the Company shall repay in full the
         outstanding principal balance of the Swing Line Loans.

         2.4    Rate  Options for all  Advances;  Maximum  Interest  Periods.

     The  Revolving  Loans  and Term  Loans may be  Floating  Rate  Advances  or
Eurocurrency Rate Advances, or a combination thereof, selected by the Company or

         Days'  prior  written  notice  to  the  Administrative  Agent  of  such
         prepayment.  Each Subsidiary Borrower may, upon prior written notice to
         the Administrative  Agent and to the applicable Alternate Currency Bank
         as  prescribed  in  the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Addendum  and

               Credit Obligations, the Tranche C Revolving Credit Obligations or
               the Tranche D Revolving  Credit  Obligations  is greater than the

               Administrative  Agent shall  calculate  the Dollar  Amount of all
               outstanding  Alternate Currency Loans, Tranche B Revolving Credit
               Obligations and Tranche D Revolving Credit Obligations using, for

               of exchange of the  Administrative  Agent in the London interbank
               market (or other market where the Administrative  Agent's foreign

                           Tranche B Revolving  Credit  Obligations is less than
                           or equal to the  Aggregate  Tranche B Revolving  Loan
                           Commitment; or

                  (B)      the Dollar  Amount of the Tranche D Revolving  Credit

                           principal  amount of Alternate  Currency Loans in the
                           same   Alternate   Currency   exceeds  the  aggregate
                           Alternate  Currency  Commitments with respect thereto
                           as a result  of  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange
                           rates,  the applicable  Borrowers  shall on such date
                           prepay  Alternate  Currency  Loans in such  Alternate
                           Currency  in an  aggregate  amount  such  that  after

               its Subsidiaries  from a condemnation of such Person's  property,
               to the extent any of the  foregoing  amounts  are not applied (or
               committed to be applied) within one hundred and twenty (120) days
               after the consummation or receipt thereof, as applicable,  to the
               purchase  of similar  assets that are not  classified  as current
               assets  under  Agreement  Accounting  Principles  and are used or
               useful in the business of the Company or its  Subsidiaries  or to
               the repair or restoration  of the Company's or its  Subsidiaries'
               property. If the Company or the applicable Subsidiary does intend
               to so reinvest any such amounts, the Company shall give notice of
               such intent (and the amount  intended  to be  reinvested)  to the
               Administrative Agent upon receipt of such proceeds.  Pending such
               reinvestment,  the Company shall use such amounts to pay down the
               principal  amount of the  Revolving  Loans to the extent  thereof
               (but  without  a  permanent   reduction  of  the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments).  If the Company or the applicable  Subsidiary  does
               not  intend to so  reinvest  such  proceeds  or if the period set
               forth in the immediately  preceding  sentence expires without the
               Company or such Subsidiary having  reinvested such proceeds,  the
               Company  shall prepay the Term Loans (within one (1) Business Day
               of the  expiration  of said one  hundred  and  twenty  (120)  day
               period) in an amount equal to such  proceeds  after giving effect
               to all reinvestments permitted by this subsection.

                    (v) At any time prior to the Trigger  Event Date and so long
               as any Term Loans are outstanding,  within ninety (90) days after
               the end of each fiscal  year,  the Company  shall prepay the Term
               Loans in an amount  equal to fifty  percent  (50%) of the  Excess
               Cash Flow, if any,  generated by the Company and its Subsidiaries
               during the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Company.

                    (vi) At any time prior to the Trigger Event Date and so long
               as  any  Term  Loans  are  outstanding,  if  the  Company  or any
               Subsidiary  shall  issue new  Equity  Interests  or  receive  any
               capital  contributions  other than Equity Interests issued to the
               Company or another Subsidiary and capital contributions  received
               from  the  Company  or  another  Subsidiary,  the  Company  shall
               promptly  notify the  Administrative  Agent of the  estimated Net
               Proceeds of such issuance or of such capital  contribution  to be
               received in respect thereof. Promptly upon, and in no event later
               than one (1) Business  Day after,  receipt by the Company or such
               Subsidiary  of Net  Proceeds of such  issuance or of such capital
               contribution,  the  Company  shall  prepay  the Term  Loans in an
               amount equal to 50% of such Net Proceeds or capital  contribution
               (unless a Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be
               continuing, in which case the Company shall prepay the Term Loans
               in an  amount  equal  to 100% of such  Net  Proceeds  or  capital
               contribution).  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  in no event shall
               the Company's  obligation to prepay the Term Loans pursuant to an
               issuance under this Section  2.5(b)(vi) exceed an amount equal to
               the Net  Proceeds of such  issuance  less any  prepayment  of the
               Subordinated  Seller Note made with respect to such  issuance and
               required under Section 4.2 of the  Subordinated  Seller Note (but
               only  to the  extent  otherwise  permitted  by the  subordination
               provisions of the Subordinated Seller Note).

                    (vii) At any time  prior to the  Trigger  Event  Date and so
               long  as any  Term  Loans  are  outstanding,  the  Company  shall
               immediately  prepay the Term Loans in an amount  equal to 100% of
               the Net Proceeds of any Indebtedness issued by the Company or any
               Subsidiary (excluding  Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section
               7.3(c)).

                    (viii) All of the mandatory  prepayments  made under Section
               2.5(b)(i)-(iii)  shall be  applied  to the  Tranche  A  Revolving
               Credit  Obligations,  the Tranche B Revolving Credit Obligations,
               the  Tranche C  Revolving  Credit  Obligations  or the  Tranche D
               Revolving Credit  Obligations,  as applicable,  first to Floating
               Rate  Loans and to any  Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans  and  Alternate
               Currency  Loans  maturing  on such date and then to  subsequently
               maturing  Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Alternate Currency Loans in
               order of maturity.

                    (ix) Any prepayments  pursuant to Sections  2.5(b)(iv)-(vii)
               shall be applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Term
               Loans against all remaining scheduled  principal  installments in
               inverse order of maturity.

          2.6      Reductions and Adjustments of Revolving Loan Commitments.

          (a) The Company may  permanently  reduce (i) the  Aggregate  Tranche A
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in whole,  or in part  ratably  among the
          Lenders with a Tranche A Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  in an aggregate
          minimum amount of $5,000,000  and in integral  multiples of $1,000,000
          in excess of that  amount  (unless the  Aggregate  Tranche A Revolving
          Loan  Commitment is reduced in whole),  (ii) the  Aggregate  Tranche B
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in whole,  or in part  ratably  among the
          Lenders with a Tranche B Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  in an aggregate
          minimum amount of $5,000,000  and in integral  multiples of $1,000,000
          in excess of that  amount  (unless the  Aggregate  Tranche B Revolving
          Loan  Commitment is reduced in whole),  (iii) the Aggregate  Tranche C
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in whole,  or in part  ratably  among the
          Lenders with a Tranche C Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  in an aggregate
          minimum amount of $5,000,000  and in integral  multiples of $1,000,000
          in excess of that  amount  (unless the  Aggregate  Tranche C Revolving
          Loan  Commitment is reduced in whole),  (iv) the  Aggregate  Tranche D
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in whole,  or in part  ratably  among the
          Lenders with a Tranche D Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  in an aggregate
          minimum amount of $5,000,000  and in integral  multiples of $1,000,000
          in excess of that  amount  (unless the  Aggregate  Tranche D Revolving
          Loan Commitment is reduced in whole) or (v) the Swing Line Commitments
          in whole or in part in amounts of  $1,000,000  upon at least three (3)
          Business  Day's prior written notice to the  Administrative  Agent and
          the Swing Line Bank, which notice shall specify the amount of any such
          reduction;  provided  that (a) the amount of the  Aggregate  Tranche A
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  may not be  reduced  below the  aggregate
          principal Dollar Amount of the outstanding  Tranche A Revolving Credit
          Obligations,  (b) the amount of the Aggregate Tranche B Revolving Loan
          Commitment  may not be reduced  below the aggregate  principal  Dollar
          Amount of the outstanding  Tranche B Revolving  Credit  Obligations or
          below the aggregate amount of Alternate Currency Commitments,  (c) the
          amount of the Aggregate Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitment may not be
          reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the outstanding
          Tranche C Revolving  Credit  Obligations or below the aggregate amount
          of the Swing  Line  Commitment  and (d) the  amount  of the  Aggregate
          Tranche D  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  may not be  reduced  below the
          aggregate  principal  Dollar  Amount  of  the  outstanding  Tranche  D
          Revolving  Credit   Obligations  or  below  the  aggregate  amount  of
          Alternate Currency  Commitments.  All accrued commitment fees shall be
          payable on the effective  date of any  termination  of all or any part
          the  obligations  of  the  Lenders  to  make  Loans  hereunder.   Each
          Subsidiary  Borrower  may,  upon three (3) Business Days prior written
          notice to the  Administrative  Agent and to the  applicable  Alternate
          Currency Bank,  terminate  entirely at any time or reduce from time to
          time by an aggregate  amount of $5,000,000  or any larger  multiple of
          $1,000,000  (or as set  forth  on the  applicable  Alternate  Currency
          Addendum),  the unused portions of the applicable  Alternate  Currency
          Commitment as specified by the applicable  Subsidiary Borrower in such
          notice  to the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  applicable  Alternate
          Currency Bank;  provided that at no time shall the Alternate  Currency
          Commitment  of any  Lender in  respect of any  Alternate  Currency  be
          reduced to an amount less than the total outstanding  principal amount
          of all Alternate  Currency Loans of such Lender made in such Alternate
          Currency.

          (b) Any Lender (i) with a Tranche A  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  may,
          upon  three  (3)   Business   Day's  prior   written   notice  to  the
          Administrative  Agent and the  Company,  convert  all of its Tranche A
          Revolving Loan Commitment to a Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitment and
          upon such conversion such Lender shall have a Tranche C Revolving Loan
          Commitment  in an  amount  equal  to such  Lender's  prior  Tranche  A
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  such Lender's  prior Tranche A Revolving
          Loan Commitment shall be permanently reduced to zero and the Aggregate
          Tranche A Revolving Loan Commitment shall be permanently reduced by an
          amount equal to such Lender's new Tranche C Revolving Loan  Commitment
          and (ii) with a Tranche B Revolving  Loan  Commitment  may, upon three
          (3) Business  Day's prior written notice to the  Administrative  Agent
          and  the  Company,  convert  all  of  its  Tranche  B  Revolving  Loan
          Commitment  to a Tranche D  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  and upon such
          conversion   such  Lender  shall  have  a  Tranche  D  Revolving  Loan
          Commitment  in an  amount  equal  to such  Lender's  prior  Tranche  B
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  such Lender's  prior Tranche B Revolving
          Loan Commitment shall be permanently reduced to zero and the Aggregate
          Tranche B Revolving Loan Commitment shall be permanently reduced by an
          amount equal to such Lender's new Tranche D Revolving Loan Commitment.

          (c) If any  prospective  Lender  has  indicated  its desire to provide
          commitments (i) with respect to Tranche C Revolving Loans, the Company
          may,  simultaneously  with the execution by such prospective Lender of
          an Assignment  Agreement pursuant to Section 14.3,  permanently reduce
          the Aggregate  Tranche A Revolving Loan  Commitment  ratably among the
          Lenders with a Tranche A Revolving Loan  Commitment in an amount equal
          to the new Tranche C Revolving  Loan  Commitment  of such  prospective
          Lender with a concurrent ratable transfer of any outstanding Tranche A
          Revolving  Loans to Tranche C Revolving Loans and (ii) with respect to
          Tranche D Revolving  Loans, the Company may,  simultaneously  with the
          execution  by  such  prospective  Lender  of an  Assignment  Agreement
          pursuant to Section 14.3,  permanently  reduce the Aggregate Tranche B
          Revolving Loan  Commitment  ratably among the Lenders with a Tranche B
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in an amount  equal to the new  Tranche D
          Revolving Loan Commitment of such prospective Lender with a concurrent
          ratable  transfer  of any  outstanding  Tranche B  Revolving  Loans to
          Tranche D Revolving Loans.

     2.7 Method of  Borrowing.  Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on each
Borrowing  Date,  each  Lender  shall  make  available  its  Revolving  Loan  in
immediately   available   funds  in  the  applicable   Agreed  Currency  to  the
Administrative Agent at its address specified on its signature page hereto or as
otherwise specified pursuant to Article XV, unless the Administrative  Agent has
notified  the Lenders that such Loan is to be made  available to the  applicable
Borrower at the  Administrative  Agent's  Eurocurrency  Payment office, in which
case each Lender shall make  available its Loan or Loans,  in funds  immediately
available to the  Administrative  Agent at its Eurocurrency  Payment Office, not
later than  12:00 noon  (local  time in the city of the  Administrative  Agent's
Eurocurrency   Payment  Office)  in  the  Agreed  Currency   designated  by  the
Administrative  Agent. The Administrative  Agent will promptly make the funds so
received  from  the  Lenders  available  to  the  applicable   Borrower  at  the
Administrative  Agent's  aforesaid  address or Eurocurrency  Payment Office,  as
applicable.

         2.8 Method of Selecting  Types and Interest  Periods for Advances.  The
applicable  Borrower  shall  select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each
Eurocurrency Rate Advance, the Interest Period, Agreed Currency and/or Alternate
Currency  applicable to each Advance from time to time. The applicable  Borrower
shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice in substantially the form
of  Exhibit B hereto (a  "Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice")  not later
than 11:00 a.m.  (New York time) (a) one (1) Business  Day before the  Borrowing
Date of each Floating  Rate Advance,  and (b) three (3) Business Days before the
Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Rate Advance to be made in Dollars, and (c)
four (4) Business  Days before the  Borrowing  Date for each  Eurocurrency  Rate
Advance to be made in any Agreed  Currency  other than Dollars and (d) three (3)
Business Days before the  Borrowing  Date for each  Alternate  Currency Loan (or
such  other  period  as may be  agreed  to by the  Administrative  Agent and the
applicable  Borrower),  and the  applicable  Borrower  shall give the applicable
Alternate  Currency Bank irrevocable notice by 11:00 a.m. (local time) three (3)
Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date for such  Alternate  Currency Loan (or
such other period as may be agreed to by the applicable  Alternate Currency Bank
or specified in the applicable Alternate Currency Addendum), specifying: (i) the
Borrowing  Date  (which  shall  be a  Business  Day) of such  Advance;  (ii) the
aggregate  amount of such  Advance;  (iii) the Type of  Advance  selected;  (iv)
whether the Advance will be a Tranche A Advance,  a Tranche B Advance, a Tranche
C Advance or a Tranche D Advance;  and (v) in the case of each Eurocurrency Rate
Loan, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency or Alternate  Currency  applicable
thereto.  Each  Floating Rate Advance,  each  Alternate  Currency Loan bearing a
fluctuating  Alternate  Currency Rate and all Obligations other than Loans shall
bear interest from and including the date of the making of such Advance,  in the
case of Loans, and the date such Obligation is due and owing in the case of such
other  Obligations,  to (but not including) the date of repayment thereof at the
Floating Rate or Alternate  Currency Rate, as  applicable,  changing when and as
such Floating Rate or Alternate Currency Rate, as applicable,  changes.  Changes
in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance  maintained as a Floating
Rate Loan will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base
Rate.  Changes in the rate of interest on any portion of any Alternate  Currency
Loan  bearing  a   fluctuating   Alternate   Currency   Rate  will  take  effect
simultaneously   with  each  change  in  such  Alternate   Currency  Rate.  Each
Eurocurrency  Rate Advance  shall bear interest from and including the first day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of
such  Interest  Period at the interest  rate  determined  as  applicable to such
Eurocurrency   Rate  Advance  and  shall  change  as  and  when  the  Applicable
Eurocurrency Margin changes.

         2.9 Minimum Amount of Each Advance. Each Advance (other than an Advance
to repay a Swing Line Loan or Reimbursement  Obligation) shall be in the minimum
Dollar Amount of $5,000,000 (or the Approximate  Equivalent Amount of any Agreed
Currency  other than Dollars or any  Alternate  Currency)  and in Dollar  Amount
multiples of  $1,000,000  (or the  Approximate  Equivalent  Amount of any Agreed
Currency other than Dollars or any Alternate  Currency) if in excess thereof (or
such other  amounts as may be specified  in the  applicable  Alternate  Currency
Addendum),  provided  that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the
unused  Aggregate  Tranche A  Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  Aggregate  Tranche B
Revolving Loan  Commitment,  Aggregate  Tranche C Revolving  Loan  Commitment or
Aggregate Tranche D Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be.

     2.10 Method of Selecting  Types and  Interest  Periods for  Conversion  and
Continuation of Advances.

         (a) Right to Convert.  The  applicable  Borrower may elect from time to
         time,  subject to the  provisions of Section 2.4 and this Section 2.10,
         to convert  all or any part of a Loan (other than a Swing Line Loan) of
         any Type into any other Type or Types of Loans (other than a Swing Line
         Loan);  provided that any conversion of any  Eurocurrency  Rate Advance
         shall be made on,  and only  on,  the last day of the  Interest  Period
         applicable thereto.

         (b) Automatic  Conversion and  Continuation.  Floating Rate Loans shall
         continue as Floating  Rate Loans  unless and until such  Floating  Rate
         Loans are converted into  Eurocurrency  Rate Loans.  Eurocurrency  Rate
         Loans shall  continue as  Eurocurrency  Rate Loans until the end of the
         then  applicable   Interest  Period   therefor,   at  which  time  such
         Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be automatically  converted into Floating
         Rate Loans unless the Company shall have given the Administrative Agent
         notice in accordance with Section 2.10(d)  requesting  that, at the end
         of such Interest  Period,  such  Eurocurrency  Rate Loans continue as a
         Eurocurrency  Rate  Loan.  Unless  a  Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation
         Notice  shall have  timely been given in  accordance  with the terms of
         this Section 2.10,  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances in an Agreed  Currency
         other than Dollars and  Alternate  Currency  Loans shall  automatically
         continue as  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances in the same Agreed Currency or
         Alternate Currency Loans in the same Alternate Currency, as applicable,
         with an Interest Period of one (1) month.

         (c)   No   Conversion    Post-Default   or   Post-Unmatured    Default.
         Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in Section 2.10(a)
         or Section  2.10(b),  no Loan may be  converted  into or continued as a
         Eurocurrency  Rate  Loan  (except  with  the  consent  of the  Required
         Lenders)  when any Default or  Unmatured  Default has  occurred  and is
         continuing.

         (d)  Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice.  The Company shall give
         the  Administrative  Agent a  Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice
         with  respect  to  each  conversion  of a  Floating  Rate  Loan  into a
         Eurocurrency  Rate Loan or continuation of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan not
         later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) (i) three (3) Business Days prior
         to the date of the requested  conversion or continuation,  with respect
         to any Loan to be converted or continued as a Eurocurrency Rate Loan in
         Dollars, (ii) four (4) Business Days prior to the date of the requested
         conversion or continuation  with respect to any Loan to be converted or
         continued as a Eurocurrency  Rate Loan in an Agreed Currency other than
         Dollars,  and  (iii)  five (5)  Business  Days  before  the date of the
         requested conversion or continuation Borrowing Date with respect to the
         conversion  or  continuation  of any  Alternate  Currency Loan (or such
         other period as may be agreed to by the Administrative  Agent), and the
         applicable  Subsidiary  Borrower  shall give the  applicable  Alternate
         Currency Bank  irrevocable  notice by 11:00 a.m. (local time) three (3)
         Business Days prior to the conversion or continuation of such Alternate
         Currency Loan (or such other period as may specified in the  applicable
         Alternate Currency Addendum), specifying: (x) the requested date (which
         shall be a Business Day) of such  conversion or  continuation;  (y) the
         amount and Type of the Loan to be converted or  continued;  and (z) the
         amount of Eurocurrency Rate Loan(s) or Alternate  Currency Loan(s),  as
         applicable,  into which such Loan is to be converted or continued,  the
         Agreed Currency or Alternate Currency, as applicable,  and the duration
         of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         (e) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,  (i) Eurocurrency
         Rate  Advances in an Agreed  Currency may be continued as  Eurocurrency
         Rate Advances only in the same Agreed Currency, (ii) Alternate Currency
         Loans in an Alternate  Currency may be continued as Alternate  Currency
         Loans only in the same Alternate Currency, (iii) Tranche A Advances may
         only be  continued  as Tranche A Advances,  (iv) Tranche B Advances may
         only be  continued  as Tranche B Advances,  (v) Tranche C Advances  may
         only be continued as Tranche C Advances and (vi) Tranche D Advances may
         only be continued as Tranche D Advances.

         2.11 Default Rate. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default,  each  outstanding Loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate
otherwise  applicable  thereto  (giving  effect  to the  provisions  of  Section
2.15(d)(ii)) plus 2% per annum.

         2.12 Method of Payment.  All  payments of  principal,  interest,  fees,
commissions,  and other amounts payable hereunder shall be made, without setoff,
deduction or counterclaim in immediately  available funds to the  Administrative
Agent (a) at the Administrative Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XV
with respect to Advances or other Obligations  denominated in Dollars and (b) at
the  Administrative  Agent's  Eurocurrency  Payment  Office with  respect to any
Advance  or other  Obligations  denominated  in an Agreed  Currency  other  than
Dollars,  or at any  other  Lending  Installation  of the  Administrative  Agent
specified in writing by the  Administrative  Agent to the Company,  by 1:00 p.m.
(New  York  time) on the date when due and shall be  applied  ratably  among the
applicable  Lenders with respect to any principal and interest due in connection
with Loans.  Each Advance  shall be repaid or prepaid in the Agreed  Currency in
which it was made in the amount borrowed and interest payable thereon shall also
be paid in such currency. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for
the account of any Lender  shall be  delivered  promptly  by the  Administrative
Agent to such  Lender in the same type of funds which the  Administrative  Agent
received  at its  address  specified  pursuant  to Article XV or at any  Lending
Installation  specified in a notice  received by the  Administrative  Agent from
such  Lender.  The Company  authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to charge the
account  of the  Company  maintained  with BNS for each  payment  of  principal,
interest,  fees,  commissions  and L/C  Obligations as it becomes due hereunder.
Each  reference to the  Administrative  Agent in this Section 2.12 shall also be
deemed to refer,  and shall apply equally,  to each Issuing Bank, in the case of
payments  required  to be made by the Company to any  Issuing  Bank  pursuant to
Article III.

         All  payments to be made by the  Borrowers  hereunder in respect of any
Alternate Currency Loans shall be made in the currencies in which such Loans are
denominated  and in funds  immediately  available,  at the office or branch from
which the Loan was made  pursuant to Section 2.20 and the  applicable  Alternate
Currency  Addendum  not later than 3:00 p.m.  (local  time) on the date on which
such  payment  shall  become  due.  Promptly,  and in any event  within  two (2)
Business  Days after  receipt,  upon  receipt of any payment of principal of the
Alternate  Currency  Loans the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Bank shall give
written notice to the  Administrative  Agent by telex or telecopy of the receipt
of such payment.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the
making of any Advance in any currency  other than Dollars,  currency  control or
exchange  regulations  are  imposed in the  country  which  issues  such  Agreed
Currency or Alternate  Currency,  as applicable,  with the result that different
types of such Agreed Currency or Alternate  Currency,  as applicable,  (the "New
Currency") are introduced and the type of currency in which the Advance was made
(the  "Original  Currency") no longer exists or any Borrower is not able to make
payment to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders or Alternate
Currency Bank, as applicable, in such Original Currency, then all payments to be
made  by  the  Borrowers  hereunder  in  such  currency  shall  be  made  to the
Administrative  Agent or Alternate Currency Bank, as applicable,  in such amount
and such type of the New  Currency  or  Dollars  as shall be  equivalent  to the
amount of such payment  otherwise  due  hereunder in the Original  Currency,  it
being the intention of the parties  hereto that the Borrowers  take all risks of
the  imposition  of any  such  currency  control  or  exchange  regulations.  In
addition,  notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions of this Section,  if, after
the making of any Advance in any currency  other than  Dollars,  the  applicable
Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Lenders or the applicable Alternate Currency Bank in the type of currency
in which such Advance was made because of the  imposition  of any such  currency
control or exchange  regulation,  then such Advance shall instead be repaid when
due in Dollars in a principal  amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date
of repayment) of such Advance.

         2.13     Evidence of Debt.

         (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
         account or accounts (a "Loan Account")  evidencing the  indebtedness of
         the  Borrowers  owing  to such  Lender  hereunder  from  time to  time,
         including  the amounts of principal  and  interest  payable and paid to
         such Lender from time to time hereunder.

         (b) The Register  maintained by the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant to
         Section  14.3(c) shall reflect (i) the date and the amount of each Loan
         made  hereunder,  the Type  thereof and the  Interest  Period,  if any,
         applicable  thereto,  (ii) the amount and the currency of any principal
         or  interest  due and  payable  or to become due and  payable  from the
         Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the effective date and amount
         of each  Assignment  Agreement  delivered to and accepted by it and the
         parties  thereto  pursuant to Section 14.3,  (iv) the amount of any sum
         received by the  Administrative  Agent hereunder for the account of the
         Lenders and each Lender's share thereof,  and (v) all other appropriate
         debits and credits as provided in this  Agreement,  including,  without
         limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest.

         (c) The entries  made in the Loan  Account,  the Register and the other
         accounts  maintained pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) of this Section
         shall be presumptively correct for all purposes, absent manifest error;
         provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative  Agent to
         maintain  such  accounts or any error  therein  shall not in any manner
         affect the  obligation  of the  Borrowers to repay the  Obligations  in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (d) Any Lender may  request  that the Tranche A  Revolving  Loans,  the
         Tranche B Revolving Loans, the Tranche C Revolving Loans, the Tranche D
         Revolving  Loans or the Term  Loans made by it each be  evidenced  by a
         promissory note in substantially the forms of Exhibit I-1, Exhibit I-2,
         Exhibit I-3, Exhibit I-4 or Exhibit I-5, respectively, to evidence such
         Lender's Tranche A Revolving Loans,  Tranche B Revolving Loans, Tranche
         C  Revolving  Loans,  Tranche  D  Revolving  Loans  or Term  Loans,  as
         applicable.  In such event,  the  applicable  Borrower  shall  promptly
         prepare,  execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note for such
         Loans payable to the order of such Lender and in a form approved by the
         Administrative  Agent and consistent  with the terms of this Agreement.
         Thereafter,  the Loans  evidenced by such  promissory note and interest
         thereon  shall at all times  (including  after  assignment  pursuant to
         Section 14.3) be  represented by one or more  promissory  notes in such
         form payable to the order of the payee named therein.

         2.14 Telephonic  Notices.  The Borrowers  authorize the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent to extend Loans, effect selections of Types of Advances and
to transfer funds based on telephonic  notices made by any person or persons the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf
of the  applicable  Borrower.  The  Borrowers  agree to deliver  promptly to the
Administrative Agent a written confirmation, signed by an Authorized Officer. If
the written  confirmation  differs in any material respect from the action taken
by the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders,  the records of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

        2.15 Promise to Pay;  Interest and Fees;  Interest Payment Dates;
Interest and Fee Basis; Taxes; Loan and Control Accounts.

         (a) Promise to Pay. Each Borrower  unconditionally promises to pay when
         due the  principal  amount  of each  Loan  and  all  other  Obligations
         incurred  by it, and to pay all unpaid  interest  accrued  thereon,  in
         accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
         Documents.

         (b) Interest Payment Dates. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Loan
         and each  Alternate  Currency  Loan  bearing  a  fluctuating  Alternate
         Currency  Rate shall be payable on each Payment Date,  commencing  with
         the first such date to occur after the date hereof, upon any prepayment
         whether by  acceleration  or  otherwise,  and at  maturity  (whether by
         acceleration  or otherwise).  Interest  accrued on each Fixed-Rate Loan
         shall be payable on the last day of its applicable  Interest Period, on

         acceleration or otherwise,  and at maturity.  Interest  accrued on each
         Fixed-Rate  Loan having an  Interest  Period  longer than three  months
         shall  also be  payable  on the last day of each  three-month  interval
         during such Interest Period.  Interest accrued on the principal balance
         of all other  Obligations  shall be payable in arrears  (i) on the last
         day of each calendar month,  commencing on the first such day following
         the incurrence of such Obligation,  (ii) upon repayment thereof in full
         or in part, and (iii) if not theretofore paid in full, at the time such
         other  Obligation  becomes due and payable  (whether by acceleration or
         otherwise).

         (c)      Fees.

                  (i) The Company shall pay to the Administrative  Agent (A) for
         the account of the Lenders in accordance  with their Pro Rata Tranche A
         Revolving  Shares,  from and after the date of this Agreement until the

         the  rate of the  then  Applicable  Commitment  Fee  Percentage  on the
         unutilized   portion  of  such  Lender's   Tranche  A  Revolving   Loan
         Commitment, (B) for the account of the Lenders in accordance with their
         Pro Rata  Tranche B Revolving  Shares,  from and after the date of this
         Agreement  until the  Tranche B  Revolving  Loan  Termination  Date,  a
         commitment fee accruing at the rate of the then  Applicable  Commitment
         Fee  Percentage on the  unutilized  portion of such Lender's  Tranche B
         Revolving Loan (treating  Alternate  Currency Loans as usage),  (C) for
         the account of the Lenders in accordance  with their Pro Rata Tranche C
         Revolving  Shares,  from and after the date of this Agreement until the
         Tranche C Revolving Loan Termination Date, a commitment fee accruing at
         the  rate of the  then  Applicable  Commitment  Fee  Percentage  on the
         unutilized portion of such Lender's Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitment
         (treating  Letters of Credit,  but not Swing Line Loans,  as usage) and
         (D) for the  account of the Lenders in  accordance  with their Pro Rata
         Tranche D Revolving  Shares,  from and after the date of this Agreement
         until the Tranche D Revolving Loan  Termination  Date, a commitment fee
         accruing at the rate of the then  Applicable  Commitment Fee Percentage
         on the  unutilized  portion of such Lender's  Tranche D Revolving  Loan
         (treating  Alternate Currency Loans as usage). The commitment fee shall
         be payable in arrears on each Payment Date hereafter, and, in addition,
         on any date on which  the  Tranche A  Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  the
         Tranche B Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  the  Tranche C  Revolving  Loan
         Commitment or the Tranche D Revolving Loan  Commitment,  as applicable,
         shall be  terminated  in whole  or,  with  respect  to such  terminated
         amount, in part.

                  (ii) The Company  agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent,
         for the sole  account of the  Administrative  Agent  (unless  otherwise
         agreed  between the  Administrative  Agent and any Lender) the fees set
         forth in the  Original  Fee  Letter,  payable  at the  times and in the
         amounts set forth therein.

                  (iii) The applicable  Borrower agrees to pay to each Alternate
         Currency Bank,  for its sole account,  a fronting fee equal to 0.25% of
         the average daily outstanding  Dollar Amount of all Alternate  Currency
         Loans made by such Alternate Currency Bank.


          (d)  Interest  and Fee Basis;  Applicable  Floating  Rate Margin,
          Applicable   Eurocurrency   Margin  and   Applicable   Commitment  Fee
          Percentage.

                  (i)  Interest  on all  Fixed-Rate  Loans  (except as  provided
         otherwise in the applicable  Alternate Currency Addendum in the case of
         an Alternate  Currency  Loan) and fees shall be  calculated  for actual
         days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day  year.  Interest on all Floating
         Rate Loans shall be calculated  for actual days elapsed on the basis of
         a 365-, or when appropriate  366-, day year.  Interest shall be payable
         for  the  day an  Obligation  is  incurred  but  not for the day of any
         payment on the amount  paid if payment is  received  prior to 3:00 p.m.
         (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or
         interest on a Loan or any payment of any other Obligations shall become
         due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
         the  next  succeeding  Business  Day and,  in the  case of a  principal
         payment,  such  extension  of  time  shall  be  included  in  computing
         interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment.

                  (ii)  The   Applicable   Floating   Rate  Margin,   Applicable
         Eurocurrency  Margin and Applicable  Commitment Fee Percentage shall be
         determined  from  time to  time on the  basis  of the  then  applicable
         Leverage Ratio in accordance with the following table:

                                     APPLICABLE    APPLICABLE    APPLICABLE
                                   FLOATING RATE  EUROCURRENCY   COMMITMENT
        LEVERAGE RATIO               MARGIN          MARGIN     FEE PERCENTAGE
        Less than 1.50                0.25%           1.25%       0.375%
        1.50 or greater,
        but less than 2.00            0.75%           1.75%       0.375%
        2.00 or greater,

        2.50 or greater,
        but less than 2.75            1.75%           2.75%       0.500%
        2.75 or greater,
        but less than 3.00            2.00%           3.00%       0.500%
        3.00 or greater               2.25%           3.25%       0.500%

                  Upon receipt of the  financial  statements  to be delivered by
         the  Company  in  accordance   with  Section   7.1(a)(i)  or  (ii),  as
         applicable,  for any fiscal quarter or, if earlier, upon receipt of the
         Company's  audited  financial  statements  for  any  fiscal  year,  the
         Applicable  Floating Rate Margin,  Applicable  Eurocurrency  Margin and
         Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage shall be adjusted, such adjustment
         being  effective  five (5) Business Days  following the  Administrative
         Agent's  receipt  of  such  financial  statements  and  the  compliance
         certificate  required to be delivered in connection  therewith pursuant
         to Section  7.1(a)(iii);  provided  that if the Company  shall not have
         timely  delivered its financial  statements in accordance  with Section
         7.1(a)(i) or (ii),  as  applicable,  then  commencing  on the date upon
         which  such  financial   statements  should  have  been  delivered  and
         continuing until such financial  statements are actually delivered,  it
         shall be assumed for purposes of determining  the  Applicable  Floating
         Rate Margin,  Applicable  Eurocurrency Margin and Applicable Commitment
         Fee  Percentage  that the Leverage  Ratio was greater than 2.50 to 1.0.
         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  for so long as any Default shall have
         occurred  and be  continuing,  the  Applicable  Floating  Rate  Margin,
         Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage
         shall  be the  highest  Applicable  Floating  Rate  Margin,  Applicable
         Eurocurrency  Margin and Applicable  Commitment Fee Margin set forth in
         the foregoing table.


         (e)      Taxes.

                  (i) Any and all payments by the Borrowers  hereunder  (whether
         in respect of principal,  interest,  fees or  otherwise)  shall be made
         free and clear of and  without  deduction  for any and all  present  or
         future taxes, levies, imposts,  deductions,  charges or withholdings or
         any  interest,  penalties  and  liabilities  with  respect  thereto but
         excluding,  in the case of each  Lender and the  Administrative  Agent,
         such taxes (including  income taxes,  franchise taxes and branch profit
         taxes)  as  are  imposed  on  or  measured  by  such  Lender's  or  the
         Administrative  Agent's,  as the case may be,  net income by the United
         States of America or any  Governmental  Authority  of the  jurisdiction
         under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
         case  may be,  is  organized  (all  such  non-excluded  taxes,  levies,
         imposts, deductions,  charges,  withholdings, and liabilities which the
         Administrative  Agent or a Lender  determines  to be applicable to this
         Agreement,  the other Loan Documents,  the Revolving Loan  Commitments,
         the Loans or the  Letters of Credit  being  hereinafter  referred to as
         "Taxes").  If any  Borrower  shall  be  required  by law to  deduct  or
         withhold  any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable  hereunder or
         under the other  Loan  Documents  to any  Lender or the  Administrative
         Agent,  (i) the sum payable  shall be  increased as may be necessary so
         that after making all required  deductions or  withholdings  (including
         deductions  applicable  to  additional  sums payable under this Section
         2.15(e))  such Lender or Agent (as the case may be)  receives an amount
         equal to the sum it  would  have  received  had no such  deductions  or
         withholdings  been made,  (ii) the applicable  Borrower shall make such
         deductions or withholdings, and (iii) the applicable Borrower shall pay
         the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority
         or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (ii) In addition,  the  Borrowers  agree to pay any present or
         future  stamp or  documentary  taxes or any other  excise  or  property
         taxes,  charges,  or similar  levies  which arise from any payment made
         hereunder,  from the issuance of Letters of Credit  hereunder,  or from
         the execution,  delivery or registration  of, or otherwise with respect
         to,  this  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents,  the  Revolving  Loan
         Commitments,  the Loans or the Letters of Credit (hereinafter  referred
         to as "Other Taxes").

                  (iii) The Company and each Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify
         each Lender and the  Administrative  Agent for the full amount of Taxes
         and Other  Taxes  (including,  without  limitation,  any Taxes or Other
         Taxes imposed by any  Governmental  Authority on amounts  payable under
         this Section 2.15(e)) paid by such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent
         (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties,  interest,
         and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
         such Taxes or Other  Taxes were  correctly  or legally  asserted.  This
         indemnification  shall be made  within  thirty (30) days after the date
         such  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent  (as the case may be) makes
         written demand  therefor.  A certificate  as to any  additional  amount
         payable to any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent under this  Section
         2.15(e)  submitted to the  applicable  Borrower and the  Administrative
         Agent  (if  a  Lender  is  so   submitting)   by  such  Lender  or  the
         Administrative Agent shall show in reasonable detail the amount payable
         and the  calculations  used to determine such amount and shall,  absent
         manifest  error,  be final,  conclusive  and  binding  upon all parties
         hereto.

                  (iv) Within  thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of
         Taxes or Other Taxes by the  Company or any  Subsidiary  Borrower,  the
         Company  shall  furnish to the  Administrative  Agent the original or a
         certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (v) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
         of the Company and the Subsidiary Borrowers  hereunder,  the agreements
         and  obligations  of the  Borrowers  contained in this Section  2.15(e)
         shall survive the payment in full of all  Obligations,  the termination
         of the Letters of Credit and the termination of this Agreement.

                  (vi)  Each  Lender   (including  any  Replacement   Lender  or
         Purchaser)  that is not  created  or  organized  under  the laws of the
         United  States of America or a political  subdivision  thereof  (each a
         "Non-U.S.  Lender") shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative
         Agent on or before the Closing  Date,  or, if later,  the date on which
         such Lender becomes a Lender  pursuant to Section 14.3 hereof (and from
         time  to  time  thereafter  upon  the  request  of the  Company  or the
         Administrative  Agent, but only for so long as such Non-U.S.  Lender is
         legally entitled to do so), either (A) two (2) duly completed copies of
         either (x) IRS Form W-8BEN,  or (y) IRS Form W-8ECI,  or in either case
         an applicable  successor  form or (B) in the case of a Non-U.S.  Lender
         that is not legally  entitled  to deliver  either form listed in clause
         (vi)(A)(I),  (I) a  certificate  of a duly  authorized  officer of such
         Non-U.S.  Lender to the effect that such  Non-U.S.  Lender is not (x) a
         "bank" within the meaning of Section  881(c)(3)(A)  of the Code,  (y) a
         "10  percent  shareholder"  of the Company or any  Subsidiary  Borrower
         within  the  meaning  of  Section  881(c)(3)(B)  of the Code,  or (z) a
         controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a related person
         within  the  meaning  of  Section   881(c)(3)(C)   of  the  Code  (such
         certificate,   an  "Exemption  Certificate")  and  (II)  two  (2)  duly
         completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or applicable  successor form. Each
         such  Lender   further  agrees  to  deliver  to  the  Company  and  the
         Administrative  Agent from time to time a true and accurate certificate
         executed in duplicate by a duly authorized  officer of such Lender in a
         form satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative  Agent,  before
         or promptly upon the occurrence of any event  requiring a change in the
         most recent certificate  previously  delivered by it to the Company and
         the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.15(e)(vi). Further,
         each  Lender  which  delivers a form or  certificate  pursuant  to this
         clause  (vi)  covenants  and agrees to deliver to the  Company  and the
         Administrative  Agent within  fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration
         of such form, for so long as this Agreement is still in effect, another
         such  certificate   and/or  two  (2)  accurate  and  complete  original
         newly-signed  copies of the  applicable  form (or any successor form or
         forms required under the Code or the applicable regulations promulgated
         thereunder).

                  Each  Lender  shall  promptly  furnish to the  Company and the
         Administrative  Agent such  additional  documents as may be  reasonably
         required by any Borrower or the  Administrative  Agent to establish any
         exemption  from or reduction of any Taxes or Other Taxes required to be
         deducted or withheld and which may be obtained without undue expense to
         such  Lender.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this  Section
         2.15(e), no Borrower shall be obligated to gross up any payments to any
         Lender  pursuant  to Section  2.15(e)(i),  or to  indemnify  any Lender
         pursuant to Section  2.15(e)(iii),  in respect of United States federal
         withholding  taxes to the extent imposed as a result of (x) the failure
         of such Lender to deliver to the  Company  the form or forms  and/or an
         Exemption  Certificate,  as  applicable  to such  Lender,  pursuant  to
         Section  2.15(e)(vi),  or (y)  such  form  or  forms  and/or  Exemption
         Certificate  not  establishing a complete  exemption from U.S.  federal
         withholding  tax or the information or  certifications  made therein by
         the Lender  being  untrue or  inaccurate  on the date  delivered in any
         material  respect,  provided  that  the  applicable  Borrower  shall be
         obligated  to gross up any  payments  to any such  Lender  pursuant  to
         Section  2.15(e)(i),  and to  indemnify  any such  Lender  pursuant  to
         Section  2.15(e)(iii),  in respect of United States federal withholding
         taxes  if (x)  any  such  failure  to  deliver  a form or  forms  or an
         Exemption Certificate or the failure of such form or forms or exemption
         certificate  to  establish  a  complete  exemption  from  U.S.  federal
         withholding  tax or inaccuracy or untruth  contained  therein  resulted
         from a change in any applicable  statute,  treaty,  regulation or other
         applicable law or any interpretation of any of the foregoing  occurring
         after the date  hereof,  which  change  rendered  such Lender no longer
         legally entitled to deliver such form or forms or Exemption Certificate
         or otherwise  ineligible  for a complete  exemption  from U.S.  federal
         withholding tax, or rendered the information or the certifications made
         in such form or forms or Exemption  Certificate untrue or inaccurate in
         any material respect, or (y) the obligation to gross up payments to any
         such Lender  pursuant to Section  2.15(e)(i),  or to indemnify any such
         Lender pursuant to Section 2.15(e)(iii), is with respect to a Purchaser
         that  becomes  a  Purchaser  as a result of an  assignment  made at the
         request of the Company.

         2.16  Notification  of  Advances,   Interest  Rates,   Prepayments  and
Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof,
the  Administrative  Agent  will  notify  each  Lender of the  contents  of each
Aggregate       Revolving      Loan      Commitment       reduction      notice,
Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice,  and repayment  notice received by it
hereunder.  The  Administrative  Agent  will  notify the  Company or  applicable
Borrower and each Lender of the interest rate and Agreed Currency  applicable to
each  Fixed-Rate  Loan  promptly  upon  determination  of such interest rate and
Agreed  Currency and will give each Lender  prompt  notice of each change in the
Alternate Base Rate.

         2.17 Lending  Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans or Letters
of Credit at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its
Lending  Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply
to any such  Lending  Installation.  Each Lender  may,  by written or  facsimile
notice  to the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Company,  designate  a  Lending
Installation  through  which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan
payments and/or payments of L/C Obligations are to be made.

         2.18  Non-Receipt  of  Funds  by the  Administrative  Agent.  Unless  a
Borrower or a Lender,  as the case may be,  notifies  the  Administrative  Agent
prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender,  the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case
of any Borrower,  a payment of principal,  interest fees or other Obligations to
the Administrative Agent for the account of any of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such  payment,  the  Administrative  Agent may  assume  that such
payment has been made. The Administrative  Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, make the amount of such  payment  available  to the  intended  recipient  in
reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the applicable Borrower, as the
case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative  Agent, the
recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to
the  Administrative  Agent the amount so made  available  together with interest
thereon in respect  of each day  during the period  commencing  on the date such
amount was so made  available  by the  Administrative  Agent  until the date the
Administrative  Agent  recovers  such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in
the case of payment by a Lender,  the Federal Funds  Effective Rate for such day
or (ii) in the case of payment by a Borrower,  the interest  rate  applicable to
the relevant Loan.

         2.19 Termination Date. This Agreement shall be effective until the date
(the "Facility  Termination  Date") upon which (a) all of the Obligations (other
than contingent  indemnity  obligations)  shall have been fully and indefeasibly
paid  and  satisfied,  (b) all  commitments  of the  Lenders  to  extend  credit
hereunder  have  expired or have been  terminated  and (c) all of the Letters of
Credit shall have expired,  been  canceled or  terminated.  Notwithstanding  the
occurrence of the Facility  Termination  Date,  obligations of the Borrowers and
other terms  hereof  which by the terms of this  Agreement  survive  termination
shall survive the Facility Termination Date.

         2.20 Replacement of Certain Lenders.  In the event a Lender  ("Affected
Lender") shall have: (a) failed to fund its Pro Rata Tranche A Revolving  Share,
Pro Rata Tranche B Revolving  Share,  Pro Rata Tranche C Revolving  Share or Pro
Rata  Tranche D  Revolving  Share of any  Advance  requested  by the  applicable
Borrower, or to make payment in respect of any Alternate Currency Loan purchased
by such Lender  pursuant to Section  2.21(e),  which such Lender is obligated to
fund under the terms of this Agreement and which failure has not been cured, (b)
requested  compensation from any Borrower under Sections 2.15(e),  4.1 or 4.2 to
recover  Taxes,  Other Taxes or other  additional  costs incurred by such Lender
which are not being  incurred  generally by the other Lenders except as provided
under any  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Addendum,  or (c) delivered a notice
pursuant  to  Section  4.3  claiming  that  such  Lender  is  unable  to  extend
Eurocurrency  Rate Loans to the Company for reasons not generally  applicable to
the other Lenders,  then, in any such case,  after the engagement of one or more
"Replacement   Lenders"   (as  defined   below)  by  the   Company   and/or  the
Administrative  Agent, the Company or the Administrative  Agent may make written
demand on such Affected Lender (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent in the
case of a  demand  by the  Company  and a copy to the  Company  in the case of a
demand by the Administrative  Agent) for the Affected Lender to assign, and such
Affected Lender shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to assign pursuant to
one or more duly executed Assignment Agreements five (5) Business Days after the
date of such demand, to one or more financial  institutions that comply with the
provisions of Section 14.3(a) which the Company or the Administrative  Agent, as
the case may be,  shall have  engaged for such  purpose  (each,  a  "Replacement
Lender"),  all of such  Affected  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under this
Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  (including,  without  limitation,  its
Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  all Loans  owing to it,  all of its  participation
interests in existing  Letters of Credit,  and its  obligation to participate in
additional  Letters  of  Credit  and  Alternate  Currency  Loans  hereunder)  in
accordance with Section 14.3. The Administrative  Agent is authorized to execute
one or more of such assignment  agreements as attorney-in-fact  for any Affected
Lender  failing to execute and deliver  the same within five (5)  Business  Days
after the date of such  demand.  With  respect to such  assignment  the Affected
Lender shall be entitled to receive,  in cash,  all amounts due and owing to the
Affected Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document,  including,  without
limitation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans owed to such
Lender,  together  with  accrued  interest  thereon  through  the  date  of such
assignment, amounts payable under Sections 2.15(e), 4.1, and 4.2 with respect to
such Affected Lender and compensation payable under Section 2.15(c) in the event
of any replacement of any Affected Lender under clause (b) or clause (c) of this
Section  2.20;  provided  that upon such  Affected  Lender's  replacement,  such
Affected  Lender  shall  cease to be a party  hereto  but shall  continue  to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections  2.15(e),  4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 11.6, as well
as to any fees  accrued for its account  hereunder  and not yet paid,  and shall
continue to be obligated under Section 12.8.

         2.21     Alternate Currency Loans.

         (a) Upon the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  precedent  set forth in
         Article V hereof  and set forth in the  applicable  Alternate  Currency
         Addendum,  from and including  the later of the date of this  Agreement
         and the date of execution of the applicable Alternate Currency Addendum
         and prior to the termination of the Aggregate  Tranche B Revolving Loan
         Commitment or the Aggregate  Tranche D Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  as
         applicable (or such earlier  termination  date as shall be specified in
         or  pursuant  to the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Addendum),  each
         Alternate  Currency Bank agrees,  on the terms and conditions set forth
         in this Agreement and in the applicable Alternate Currency Addendum, to
         make Alternate Currency Loans under such Alternate Currency Addendum to
         the applicable  Borrower party to such Alternate Currency Addendum from
         time to time in the applicable Alternate Currency,  in an amount not to
         exceed  each  such  Alternate  Currency  Bank's  applicable   Alternate
         Currency  Commitment;  provided that at no time shall the Dollar Amount
         of the Alternate  Currency  Loans for any specific  Alternate  Currency
         exceed the maximum  amount  specified  as the  maximum  amount for such
         Alternate Currency in the applicable  Alternate Currency Addendum other
         than as a result of currency  fluctuations  and then only to the extent
         permitted in Section 2.5(b)(ii) and provided,  further, that at no time
         shall  (i)  the  Dollar  Amount  of  the  Tranche  B  Revolving  Credit
         Obligations  exceed the Aggregate  Tranche B Revolving Loan Commitments
         or (ii) the Dollar Amount of the Tranche D Revolving Credit Obligations
         exceed the Aggregate Tranche D Revolving Loan  Commitments.  Subject to
         the  terms of this  Agreement  and the  applicable  Alternate  Currency
         Addendum,  the  applicable  Borrowers  may borrow,  repay and  reborrow
         Alternate  Currency Loans in the applicable  Alternate  Currency at any
         time prior to the termination of the Aggregate Tranche B Revolving Loan
         Commitment or the Aggregate  Tranche D Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  as
         applicable (or such earlier  termination  date as shall be specified in
         or pursuant to the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Addendum).  On the
         termination of the Aggregate Tranche B Revolving Loan Commitment or the
         Aggregate  Tranche D Revolving Loan Commitment,  as applicable (or such
         earlier  termination  date as shall be  specified in or pursuant to the
         applicable  Alternate  Currency  Addendum),  the outstanding  principal
         balance of the  Alternate  Currency  Loans shall be paid in full by the
         applicable  Borrower  and  prior to the  termination  of the  Aggregate
         Tranche  B  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  or  the  Aggregate  Tranche  D
         Revolving Loan Commitment,  as applicable (or such earlier  termination
         date as shall be specified in or pursuant to the  applicable  Alternate
         Currency Addendum) prepayments of the Alternate Currency Loans shall be
         made  by the  applicable  Borrower  if and to the  extent  required  by
         Section  2.5(b)(ii).  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that
         no Lender shall have any  obligation  hereunder to execute an Alternate
         Currency Addendum and so to become an Alternate Currency Bank.

         (b) Borrowing  Notice.  When the applicable  Borrower desires to borrow
         under this Section 2.21, the  applicable  Borrower shall deliver to the
         applicable  Alternate  Currency  Bank  and the  Administrative  Agent a
         Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice, signed by it, as provided in
         Section 2.8  specifying  that such  Borrower is requesting an Alternate
         Currency Loan pursuant to this Section 2.21 and whether such  borrowing
         shall be made as a  Tranche B  Revolving  Loan or  Tranche D  Revolving
         Loan,  and the  Administrative  Agent shall give  prompt  notice to the
         Lenders  with a  Tranche B  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  or a Tranche D
         Revolving Loan  Commitment,  as applicable,  of any such request for an
         Alternate Currency Loan. Any  Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation  Notice
         given pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be irrevocable.

         (c) Termination.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in no
         event shall any  Alternate  Currency  Bank have the right to accelerate
         the Alternate  Currency Loans outstanding under any Alternate  Currency
         Addendum or to terminate its  commitments  (if any)  thereunder to make
         Alternate  Currency  Loans  prior  to the  stated  termination  date in
         respect  thereof,  except that each Alternate  Currency Bank shall have
         such rights upon an  acceleration of the Loans and a termination of the
         Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to Article IX.

         (d)  Statements.  Each  Alternate  Currency  Bank shall  furnish to the
         Administrative  Agent not less frequently  than monthly,  at the end of
         each calendar quarter,  and at any other time at the reasonable request
         of the Administrative  Agent, a statement setting forth the outstanding
         Alternate  Currency  Loans made and repaid  during the period since the
         last such report under such Alternate Currency Addendum.

         (e)  Risk   Participation.   Immediately  and  automatically  upon  the
         occurrence of a Default under Sections 8.1(a),  (e) or (f), each Lender
         with a Tranche B  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  or a Tranche D Revolving
         Loan Commitment, as applicable, shall be deemed to have unconditionally
         and irrevocably  purchased from the applicable Alternate Currency Bank,
         without   recourse  or   warranty,   an   undivided   interest  in  and
         participation  in each  Alternate  Currency  Loan  ratably in an amount
         equal to such  Lender's Pro Rata Tranche B Revolving  Share or Pro Rata
         Tranche D Revolving  Share,  as applicable,  of the amount of principal
         and accrued  interest of such Loan, and immediately  and  automatically
         all Alternate Currency Loans shall be converted to and redenominated in
         Dollars equal to the Dollar Amount of each such Alternate Currency Loan
         determined  as of the  date of such  conversion;  provided  that to the
         extent such conversion shall occur other than at the end of an Interest
         Period, the applicable  Borrower shall pay to the applicable  Alternate
         Currency  Bank,  all  losses  and  breakage  costs  related  thereto in
         accordance  with  Section  4.4.  Each of the  Lenders  shall pay to the
         applicable Alternate Currency Bank not later than two (2) Business Days
         following a request for payment from such  Alternate  Currency Bank, in
         Dollars, an amount equal to the undivided interest in and participation
         in the  Alternate  Currency Loan  purchased by such Lender  pursuant to
         this  Section  2.21(e).  In the  event  that any  Lender  fails to make
         payment to the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Bank of any amount due
         under this Section 2.21(e),  the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
         to receive,  retain and apply against such obligation the principal and
         interest   otherwise   payable  to  such  Lender  hereunder  until  the
         Administrative  Agent receives from such Lender an amount sufficient to
         discharge  such  Lender's  payment  obligation  as  prescribed  in this
         Section  2.21(e)  together with  interest  thereon at the Federal Funds
         Effective Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of
         demand by the applicable Alternate Currency Bank and ending on the date
         such  obligation  is fully  satisfied.  The  Administrative  Agent will
         promptly  remit  all  payments   received  as  provided  above  to  the
         applicable  Alternate  Currency  Bank.  In  consideration  of the  risk
         participations  prescribed in this Section  2.21(e),  each Lender shall
         receive,  from  the  accrued  interest  paid for  periods  prior to the
         conversion  of any Alternate  Currency  Loan as described  above by the
         applicable  Borrower on each  Alternate  Currency  Loan, a fee equal to
         such Lender's Pro Rata Tranche B Revolving  Share or Pro Rata Tranche D
         Revolving Share, as applicable,  of the Applicable  Eurocurrency Margin
         component of the interest  accrued on such Loan, as in effect from time
         to time during the period such  interest  accrued.  Such portion of the
         interest paid by the applicable Borrower on Alternate Currency Loans to
         the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  Bank shall be paid as promptly as
         possible by such Alternate Currency Bank to the  Administrative  Agent,
         and the Administrative Agent shall as promptly as possible convert such
         amount into Dollars at the spot rate of exchange in accordance with its
         normal banking  practices and apply such resulting amount ratably among
         the Lenders  (including the Alternate  Currency Banks) in proportion to
         their  Pro  Rata  Tranche  B  Revolving  Share or Pro  Rata  Tranche  D
         Revolving Share, as applicable.

         (f) Other  Provisions  Applicable  to  Alternate  Currency  Loans.  The
         specification  of payment of  Alternate  Currency  Loans in the related
         Alternate Currency at a specific place pursuant to this Agreement is of
         the essence. Such Alternate Currency shall, subject to Section 2.21, be
         the currency of account and payment of such Loans under this  Agreement
         and  the  applicable   Alternate  Currency  Addendum.   Notwithstanding
         anything in this Agreement,  the obligation of the applicable  Borrower
         in respect of such Loans shall not be  discharged  by an amount paid in
         any other currency or at another place,  whether pursuant to a judgment
         or otherwise,  to the extent the amount so paid,  on prompt  conversion
         into the  applicable  Alternate  Currency  and  transfer to such Lender
         under  normal  banking  procedure,  does not yield  the  amount of such
         Alternate Currency due under this Agreement or the applicable Alternate
         Currency Addendum. In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a
         judgment or otherwise, upon conversion and transfer, does not result in
         payment  of the  amount  of such  Alternate  Currency  due  under  this
         Agreement or the applicable  Alternate Currency  Addendum,  such Lender
         shall have an independent cause of action against each of the Borrowers
         for  the  currency  deficit.  In  the  event  that  any  payment,  upon
         conversion and transfer,  results in payment in excess of the amount of
         such  Alternate  Currency due under this  Agreement  or the  applicable
         Alternate  Currency  Addendum,  such Lender shall refund such excess to
         the applicable Borrower.

         2.22 Judgment  Currency.  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in
any court,  it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower  hereunder in
the currency  expressed to be payable  herein (the  "specified  currency")  into
another currency,  the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively  do so,  that the rate of  exchange  used  shall be that at which in
accordance  with  normal  banking  procedures  the  Administrative  Agent  could
purchase the specified  currency with such other currency at the  Administrative
Agent's office in New York, New York on the Business Day preceding that on which
the final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of each Borrower in
respect  of any sum due to any  Lender  or the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder
shall,  notwithstanding  any  judgment  in a currency  other than the  specified
currency,  be  discharged  only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent (as the case may be) of any
sum  adjudged  to  be  so  due  in  such  other  currency  such  Lender  or  the
Administrative  Agent  (as  the  case  may be) may in  accordance  with  normal,
reasonable  banking  procedures  purchase the specified currency with such other
currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent, as the case may
be, in the specified currency,  each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that
it may effectively do so, as a separate  obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment,  to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified  currency so purchased
exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other
Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate  payment
to such Lender under Section 13.2, such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent, as
the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.

         2.23  Market  Disruption;   Denomination  of  Amounts  in  Dollars;
Dollar Equivalent of Reimbursement Obligations.

         (a)  Notwithstanding  the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in
         this  Article  II with  respect to any  Advance in any Agreed  Currency
         other than Dollars or an Alternate  Currency,  as applicable,  if there
         shall  occur  on or prior to the date of such  Advance  any  change  in
         national or international  financial,  political or economic conditions
         or  currency  exchange  rates or exchange  controls  which would in the
         reasonable  opinion  of  the  Company,  any  Subsidiary  Borrower,  any
         Alternate  Currency  Bank,  the  Administrative  Agent or the  Required
         Lenders  make it  impracticable  for the  Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans  or
         Alternate  Currency Loans  comprising such Advance to be denominated in
         the Agreed Currency or Alternate Currency, as applicable,  specified by
         the applicable Borrower,  then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith
         give notice  thereof to the Company or such  Borrower,  the  applicable
         Alternate  Currency Bank and the Lenders,  or the  applicable  Borrower
         shall give notice to the Administrative Agent, the applicable Alternate
         Currency  Bank  and  the  Lenders,   as  the  case  may  be,  and  such
         Eurocurrency  Rate  Loans or  Alternate  Currency  Loans  shall  not be
         denominated  in such currency but shall be made on such  Borrowing Date
         in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount
         of the aggregate  principal amount  specified in the related  Borrowing
         Notice, as Floating Rate Loans, unless the applicable Borrower notifies
         the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Day before such date
         that (i) it  elects  not to  borrow  on such  date or (ii) it elects to
         borrow  on a date at least  three (3)  Business  Days  thereafter  in a
         different Agreed Currency or Alternate Currency, as the case may be, in
         which  the  denomination  of such  Loans  would in the  opinion  of the
         Administrative  Agent, any Alternate Currency Bank, if applicable,  and
         the  Required  Lenders be  practicable  and in an  aggregate  principal
         amount equal to the Dollar  Amount of the  aggregate  principal  amount
         specified in the related Borrowing Notice.

         (b) Except as set forth in  Sections  2.1,  2.5 and 2.21,  all  amounts
         referenced  in this  Article  II shall be  calculated  using the Dollar
         Amount  determined based upon the Equivalent Amount in effect as of the
         date of any  determination  thereof;  provided  to the extent  that any
         Borrower  shall be  obligated  hereunder  to pay in Dollars any Advance
         denominated in a currency other than Dollars, such amount shall be paid
         in Dollars  using the Dollar  Amount of the Advance  (calculated  based
         upon the  Equivalent  Amount in effect on the date of payment  thereof)
         and in the event that the  applicable  Borrower  does not reimburse the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders are required to fund a purchase of
         a participation in such Advance, such purchase shall be made in Dollars
         in an amount  equal to the Dollar  Amount of such  Advance  (calculated
         based  upon the  Equivalent  Amount in  effect  on the date of  payment
         thereof).  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the contrary,  the full
         risk of currency  fluctuations  shall be borne by the Borrowers and the
         Borrowers  agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuing Bank,  the
         Alternate Currency Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders from
         and against any loss  resulting  from any  borrowing  denominated  in a
         currency  other  than in  Dollars  and for  which the  Lenders  are not
         reimbursed on the day of such borrowing.

         2.24 Subsidiary Borrowers.  The Company may at any time or from time to
time,  with the  consent  of the  Administrative  Agent,  add as a party to this
Agreement any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary to be a "Subsidiary Borrower" hereunder by
the execution and delivery to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders of (a) a
duly completed Assumption Letter by such Subsidiary, with the written consent of
the  Company at the foot  thereof  and (b) such  other  guaranty,  security  and
subordinated   intercompany   indebtedness   documents   (and  related   closing
documentation) as may be reasonably  required by the Administrative  Agent, such
documents  with  respect  to any  additional  Subsidiaries  to be  substantially
similar in form and  substance  to the Loan  Documents  executed on or about the
Closing  Date by or in  respect  of the  Subsidiaries  parties  hereto as of the
Closing Date.  Upon such execution,  delivery and consent such Subsidiary  shall
for all purposes be a party  hereto as a  Subsidiary  Borrower as fully as if it
had executed  and  delivered  this  Agreement.  So long as the  principal of and
interest on any Advances made to any  Subsidiary  Borrower  under this Agreement
shall have been paid in full,  all  Letters of Credit  issued for the account of
such  Subsidiary  Borrower have expired or been returned and  terminated and all
other  obligations of such  Subsidiary  Borrower under this Agreement shall have
been fully performed,  the Company may, by not less than five (5) Business Days'
prior  notice to the  Administrative  Agent  (which  shall  promptly  notify the
Lenders thereof),  terminate such Subsidiary  Borrower's status as a "Subsidiary
Borrower".

         2.25 Security.  All  Obligations of the Borrowers  under this Agreement
and all other Loan Documents  shall be secured in accordance with the Collateral
Documents.

         2.26 Assignment and  Reallocation of Existing  Commitments and Existing
Loans.  Each of the parties  hereto  severally and for itself agrees that on the
Amendment  Effective  Date,  each  Existing  Lender  hereby  irrevocably  sells,
transfers,  conveys and assigns,  without  recourse,  representation or warranty
(except as expressly set forth  herein),  to each Lender that is not an Existing
Lender,  and each such Lender hereby  irrevocably  purchases  from such Existing
Lender,  a portion of the rights and  obligations of such Existing  Lender under
the Existing  Credit  Agreement  and each other Loan  Document in respect of its
Existing  Loans and  Commitments  under (and as defined in) the Existing  Credit
Agreement  such  that,  after  giving  effect to the  foregoing  assignment  and
delegation, each Lender's Revolving Loan Commitments and portion of the Existing
Loans for the purposes of this Agreement and each other Loan Document will be as
set forth opposite such Person's name on Exhibit A to this Agreement.

         (a) Each Existing Lender hereby represents and warrants to each Lender,
         that  immediately  before  giving  effect  to the  provisions  of  this
         Section,  (i) such Existing Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of
         the portion of its rights and  obligations  in respect of its  Existing
         Loans being  assigned to each Lender as set forth above;  and (ii) such
         rights and obligations  being assigned and sold by such Existing Lender
         are free and clear of any adverse claim or encumbrance  created by such
         Existing Lender.

         (b) Each of the Lenders hereby  acknowledges  and agrees that (i) other
         than the representations and warranties  contained above, no Lender nor
         the Administrative  Agent has made any representations or warranties or
         assumed  any  responsibility   with  respect  to  (A)  any  statements,
         warranties  or  representations  made  in or in  connection  with  this
         Agreement  or  the  execution,   legality,  validity,   enforceability,
         genuineness  or  sufficiency  of this  Agreement,  the Existing  Credit
         Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B) the financial  condition of
         any Borrower or the  performance  by any  Borrower of the  Obligations;
         (ii) it has received such  information as it has deemed  appropriate to
         make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement;
         and (iii) it has made and continues to make its own credit decisions in
         taking or not taking  action under this  Agreement,  independently  and
         without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender.

         (c) The  Borrowers,  each of the Lenders and the  Administrative  Agent
         also  agree  that  each  of the  Lenders  shall,  as of  the  Amendment
         Effective  Date,  have all of the rights and  interests  as a Lender in
         respect of the Loans  purchased and assumed by it, to the extent of the
         rights and obligations so purchased and assumed by it.

         (d) Each Lender which is purchasing  any portion of the Existing  Loans
         shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent immediately  available funds
         in the full amount of the  purchase  made by it and the  Administrative
         Agent  shall,  to the extent of the funds so  received,  disburse  such
         funds to the Existing  Lenders that are making sales and assignments in
         the amount of the portions so sold and assigned.

ARTICLE III:  THE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY

         3.1  Obligation  to Issue  Letters of Credit.  Subject to the terms and
conditions  of  this  Agreement  and  in  reliance  upon  the   representations,
warranties  and  covenants  of the Company  herein set forth,  each Issuing Bank
hereby agrees to issue for the account of the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower
through such Issuing  Bank's  branches as it and the Company may jointly  agree,
one or more Letters of Credit  denominated  in Dollars in  accordance  with this
Article III,  from time to time during the period,  commencing  on the Amendment
Effective  Date and ending on the Business Day prior to the  termination  of the
Aggregate Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitment.

         3.2 Transitional Provision. Schedule 3.2 contains a schedule of certain
letters of credit  issued for the account of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries
prior to the Amendment  Effective Date.  From and after the Amendment  Effective
Date,  such  letters of credit  shall be deemed to be  Letters of Credit  issued
pursuant to this Article III.

          3.3 Types and Amounts. No Issuing Bank shall have any obligation to
and no Issuing Bank shall:

          (a) issue (or amend)  any Letter of Credit if on the date of  issuance
          (or amendment),  before or after giving effect to the Letter of Credit
          requested hereunder,  (i) the amount of the Tranche C Revolving Credit
          Obligations  at  such  time  would  exceed  the  Aggregate  Tranche  C
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment  at  such  time,  or  (ii)  the  aggregate
          outstanding amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed $25,000,000; or

          (b) issue (or amend) any Letter of Credit which has an expiration date
          later  than the date  which is the  earlier  of one (1) year after the
          date of issuance  thereof or the Tranche C Revolving Loan  Termination
          Date;  provided  that any Letter of Credit  with a one-year  tenor may
          provide for the renewal thereof for additional  one-year  periods (not
          to extend beyond the Tranche C Revolving Loan  Termination  Date) with
          the consent of the applicable Issuing Bank.

          3.4 Conditions. In addition to being subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, the obligation of an
Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit is subject to the satisfaction in
full of the following conditions:

          (a) the Company shall have  delivered to the  applicable  Issuing Bank
          (at such times and in such manner as such Issuing Bank may  reasonably
          prescribe)  and the  Administrative  Agent,  a request for issuance of
          such  Letter of Credit in  substantially  the form of Exhibit C hereto
          (each such request a "Request For Letter of  Credit"),  duly  executed
          application  for such  Letter of  Credit,  and such  other  documents,
          instructions  and agreements as may be required  pursuant to the terms
          thereof  (all  such   applications,   documents,   instructions,   and
          agreements being referred to herein as the "L/C  Documents"),  and the
          proposed  Letter of Credit shall be  reasonably  satisfactory  to such
          Issuing Bank as to form and content; and

          (b) as of the date of  issuance  no order,  judgment  or decree of any
          court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority shall purport by its terms
          to enjoin or restrain  the  applicable  Issuing Bank from issuing such
          Letter of Credit and no law,  rule or  regulation  applicable  to such
          Issuing  Bank and no request or  directive  (whether or not having the
          force of law) from a  Governmental  Authority with  jurisdiction  over
          such  Issuing  Bank shall  prohibit or request  that such Issuing Bank
          refrain  from the  issuance  of  Letters  of Credit  generally  or the
          issuance of that Letter of Credit.

          3.5  Procedure  for  Issuance of Letters of Credit.

          (a)  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions  of this  Article  III and
          provided that the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2
          and 5.3 hereof have been satisfied, the applicable Issuing Bank shall,
          on the  requested  date,  issue a Letter  of  Credit  on behalf of the
          Company or a Subsidiary  Borrower,  as applicable  in accordance  with
          such Issuing  Bank's usual and customary  business  practices  and, in
          this  connection,  such  Issuing  Bank may assume that the  applicable
          conditions  set forth in Sections  3.3(b),  3.4(b) and 5.3 hereof have
          been  satisfied  unless it shall have received  notice to the contrary
          from the  Administrative  Agent or a Lender or has knowledge  that the
          applicable conditions have not been met.

          (b)  Promptly,  and in any event not more  than one (1)  Business  Day
          following the date of issuance of any Letter of Credit, the applicable
          Issuing  Bank shall  give the  Administrative  Agent  written or telex
          notice, or telephonic notice confirmed promptly thereafter in writing,
          of the  issuance of a Letter of Credit  (provided  that the failure to
          provide such notice  shall not result in any  liability on the part of
          such Issuing Bank), and the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly give
          notice to the Lenders of each such issuance.

          (c) No Issuing Bank shall extend or amend any Letter of Credit  unless
          the requirements of this Section 3.5 are met as though a new Letter of
          Credit was being requested and issued.

          3.6 Letter of Credit  Participation.  On the Amendment Effective Date,
with  respect  to  the  Letters  of  Credit  identified  on  Schedule  3.2,  and
immediately  upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit  hereunder,  each Lender
shall be deemed to have automatically, irrevocably and unconditionally purchased
and  received  from  the  applicable  Issuing  Bank an  undivided  interest  and
participation in and to such Letter of Credit, the obligations of the Company in
respect   thereof,   and  the   liability  of  such   Issuing  Bank   thereunder
(collectively, an "L/C Interest") in the amount available for drawing under such
Letter of Credit multiplied by such Lender's Pro Rata Tranche C Revolving Share.


          3.7 Reimbursement  Obligation.

          (a) The Company agrees unconditionally,  irrevocably and absolutely to
          pay immediately to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the account of the
          Lenders with Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitments,  the amount of each
          advance  drawn under or pursuant to a Letter of Credit or an L/C Draft
          related  thereto  (such  obligation  of the Company to  reimburse  the
          Administrative  Agent for an advance  made under a Letter of Credit or
          L/C  Draft  being   hereinafter   referred  to  as  a   "Reimbursement
          Obligation" with respect to such Letter of Credit or L/C Draft),  each
          such  reimbursement  to be made  by the  Company  no  later  than  the
          Business Day on which the  applicable  Issuing  Bank makes  payment of
          each such L/C Draft or, if the Company shall have received notice of a
          Reimbursement Obligation later than 12:00 noon (New York time), on any
          Business  Day or on a day which is not a Business  Day,  no later than
          12:00 noon (New York time), on the immediately  following Business Day
          or, in the case of any  other  draw on a Letter  of  Credit,  the date
          specified  in the demand of such Issuing  Bank.  If the Company at any
          time  fails  to  repay a  Reimbursement  Obligation  pursuant  to this
          Section 3.7, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative
          Agent and the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
          and the Company shall be deemed to have  requested to borrow Tranche C
          Revolving  Loans  from the  Lenders  with  Tranche  C  Revolving  Loan
          Commitments,  as of  the  date  of  the  advance  giving  rise  to the
          Reimbursement   Obligation,   equal  to  the   amount  of  the  unpaid
          Reimbursement Obligation. Such Tranche C Revolving Loans shall be made
          as of the  date of the  payment  giving  rise  to  such  Reimbursement
          Obligation,  automatically, without notice and without any requirement
          to satisfy the conditions precedent otherwise applicable to an Advance
          of Tranche C Revolving Loans.

          (b) Each Lender with a Tranche C Revolving Loan Commitment  shall upon
          any  notice   pursuant  to  Section   3.7(a)  make  available  to  the
          Administrative  Agent for the account of the relevant  Issuing Bank an
          amount in Dollars and in immediately  available funds equal to its Pro
          Rata Tranche C Revolving Share of the amount of the drawing, whereupon
          such Lenders shall (subject to Section  3.7(d)) each be deemed to have
          made a  Revolving  Loan  constituting  a Floating  Rate  Advance,  the
          proceeds of which  Advance  shall be used to repay such  Reimbursement
          Obligation.  If any Lender so notified  fails to make available to the
          Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of
          such Lender's Pro Rata Tranche C Revolving  Share of the amount of the
          drawing by no later than 2:00 p.m.  (New York time) on the date of the
          advance  giving rise to the  Reimbursement  Obligation,  then interest
          shall accrue on such Lender's  obligation  to make such payment,  from
          such date to the date such Lender  makes such  payment,  at a rate per
          annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to
          time during such period. The  Administrative  Agent will promptly give
          notice  of  the   occurrence   of  the  draw,   but   failure  of  the
          Administrative  Agent to give any such  notice in  sufficient  time to
          enable  any  Lender  to effect  such  payment  on such date  shall not
          relieve such Lender from its obligations under this Section 3.7.

          (c) Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make
          the Tranche C Revolving Loans, as contemplated by this Section 3.7, as
          a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit,  shall be absolute and
          unconditional  and without recourse to the Issuing Banks and shall not
          be  affected  by  any   circumstance,   including   (i)  any  set-off,
          counterclaim,  recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving
          Lender  may have  against an Issuing  Bank,  the  Company or any other
          Person for any reason  whatsoever;  (ii) the occurrence or continuance
          of a Default,  an Unmatured  Default or a Material Adverse Effect;  or
          (iii) any other circumstance,  happening or event whatsoever,  whether
          or not similar to any of the foregoing.

          (d) If, for any  reason,  the Company  fails to repay a  Reimbursement
          Obligation on the day such  Reimbursement  Obligation  arises and, for
          any reason,  the Lenders are unable to make or have no  obligation  to
          make Revolving Loans,  then such  Reimbursement  Obligation shall bear
          interest from and after such day,  until paid in full, at the interest
          rate applicable to a Floating Rate Advance.

          3.8      Letter of Credit Fees.  The Company agrees to pay:

          (a) quarterly, in arrears, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
          benefit of the Lenders  with a Tranche C Revolving  Loan  Commitment a
          letter of credit fee at a rate per annum equal to the  Applicable  L/C
          Fee Percentage on the average daily  outstanding  amount available for
          drawing under all Letters of Credit;

          (b) quarterly, in arrears, to the applicable Issuing Bank, a letter of
          credit fronting fee in an amount agreed to between the Company and the
          applicable  Issuing Bank on the average daily  outstanding face amount
          available  for  drawing  under all  Letters  of Credit  issued by such
          Issuing Bank; and

          (c) to the applicable  Issuing Bank, all reasonable and customary fees
          and other issuance, amendment,  document examination,  negotiation and
          presentment  expenses  and  related  charges  in  connection  with the
          issuance,  amendment,   presentation  of  L/C  Drafts,  and  the  like
          customarily  charged by such  Issuing  Banks  with  respect to standby
          letters of credit.

          3.9 Issuing  Bank Reporting  Requirements.  In addition to the notices
required by Section  3.5(b),  each Issuing  Bank shall,  no later than the tenth
(10th)  Business  Day  following  the last  day of each  month,  provide  to the
Administrative  Agent, upon the Administrative  Agent's request,  schedules,  in
form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, showing
the date of issue,  account  party,  amount,  expiration  date and the reference
number of each Letter of Credit issued by it outstanding at any time during such
month and the  aggregate  amount  paid by the  Company  during  such  month.  In
addition,  upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall
furnish  to the  Administrative  Agent  copies of any  Letter of Credit  and any
application for or reimbursement agreement with respect to a Letter of Credit to
which the Issuing Bank is party and such other  documentation  as may reasonably
be requested by the  Administrative  Agent. Upon the request of any Lender,  the
Administrative  Agent will provide to such Lender  information  concerning  such
Letters of Credit.

          3.10 Indemnification; Exoneration.

          (a) In  addition  to amounts  payable as  elsewhere  provided  in this
          Article III, the Company hereby agrees to protect,  indemnify, pay and
          save  harmless the  Administrative  Agent,  each Issuing Bank and each
          Lender from and against  any and all  liabilities  and costs which the
          Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender may incur or be
          subject to as a consequence,  direct or indirect,  of (i) the issuance
          of any  Letter of Credit  other  than,  in the case of the  applicable
          Issuing  Bank,  as  a  result  of  its  gross  negligence  or  willful
          misconduct,  as  determined  by  the  final  judgment  of a  court  of
          competent jurisdiction,  or (ii) the failure of the applicable Issuing
          Bank to honor a  drawing  under a Letter  of Credit as a result of any
          act or  omission,  whether  rightful  or  wrongful,  of any present or
          future de jure or de facto  Governmental  Authority  (all such acts or
          omissions herein called "Governmental Acts").

          (b) As among the Company,  the Lenders,  the Administrative  Agent and
          the  Issuing  Banks,  the  Company  assumes  all risks of the acts and
          omissions  of, or misuse of such Letter of Credit by, the  beneficiary
          of any Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the
          foregoing,   subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Letter  of  Credit
          applications and Letter of Credit reimbursement agreements executed by
          the Company at the time of request  for any Letter of Credit,  neither
          the  Administrative  Agent,  any Issuing  Bank nor any Lender shall be
          responsible (in the absence of gross negligence or willful  misconduct
          of such party in  connection  therewith,  as  determined  by the final
          judgment  of a court of  competent  jurisdiction):  (i) for the  form,
          validity,  sufficiency,  accuracy,  genuineness or legal effect of any
          document submitted by any party in connection with the application for
          and issuance of the Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove
          to be in  any  or  all  respects  invalid,  insufficient,  inaccurate,
          fraudulent  or forged;  (ii) for the  validity or  sufficiency  of any
          instrument  transferring  or  assigning or  purporting  to transfer or
          assign a Letter of Credit or the  rights  or  benefits  thereunder  or
          proceeds  thereof,  in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid
          or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of
          a Letter  of  Credit to comply  duly  with  conditions  not  expressly
          provided on the face of such Letter of Credit and required in order to
          draw  upon  such  Letter  of  Credit;  (iv)  for  errors,   omissions,
          interruptions  or delays in  transmission or delivery of any messages,
          by  mail,   cable,   telegraph,   telex,  or  other  similar  form  of
          teletransmission  or otherwise;  (v) for errors in  interpretation  of
          technical trade terms;  (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission
          or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
          any  Letter  of  Credit  or of the  proceeds  thereof;  (vii)  for the
          misapplication  by  the  beneficiary  of a  Letter  of  Credit  of the
          proceeds  of any drawing  under such Letter of Credit;  and (viii) for
          any  consequences  arising  from  causes  beyond  the  control  of the
          Administrative  Agent,  the Issuing Banks and the Lenders,  including,
          without  limitation,  any  Governmental  Acts. None of the above shall
          affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any Issuing Bank's rights or
          powers under this Section 3.10.

          (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
          provisions  hereinabove set forth,  any action taken or omitted by any
          Issuing Bank under or in connection  with the Letters of Credit or any
          related  certificates shall not, in the absence of gross negligence or
          willful misconduct,  as determined by the final judgment of a court of
          competent   jurisdiction,   put  the  applicable   Issuing  Bank,  the
          Administrative  Agent or any Lender under any  resulting  liability to
          the Company or relieve the Company of any of its obligations hereunder
          to any such Person.

          (d) Without  prejudice to the  survival of any other  agreement of the
          Company  hereunder,  the  agreements  and  obligations  of the Company
          contained in this  Section  3.10 shall  survive the payment in full of
          principal and interest  hereunder,  the  termination of the Letters of
          Credit and the termination of this Agreement.

         3.11 Cash Collateral.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein
or in any  application  for a Letter of Credit,  after the occurrence and during
the  continuance of a Default,  the Company  shall,  on the Business Day that it
receives the Administrative  Agent's demand, deliver to the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks,  cash, or other collateral
of a type satisfactory to the Required Lenders, having a value, as determined by
such Lenders, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Dollar Amount
of the  outstanding  L/C  Obligations.  In addition,  if the Tranche C Revolving
Credit Availability is at any time less than the Dollar Amount of all contingent
L/C  Obligations  outstanding  at any  time,  the  Company  shall  deposit  cash
collateral  with the  Administrative  Agent in  Dollars  in an  amount  equal to
one-hundred  five  percent  (105%)  of the  Dollar  Amount  by  which  such  L/C
Obligations  exceed  such  Tranche C  Revolving  Credit  Availability.  Any such
collateral  shall  be held by the  Administrative  Agent in a  separate  account
appropriately  designated  as a cash  collateral  account  in  relation  to this
Agreement and the Letters of Credit and retained by the Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks as collateral  security for the
Company's  obligations  in respect of this  Agreement and each of the Letters of
Credit and L/C Drafts.  Such amounts  shall be applied to reimburse  the Issuing
Banks for  drawings  or  payments  under or pursuant to Letters of Credit or L/C
Drafts, or if no such reimbursement is required, to payment of such of the other
Obligations as the Administrative Agent shall determine.  If no Default shall be
continuing,  amounts  remaining  in  any  cash  collateral  account  established
pursuant  to this  Section  3.11  which are not to be applied  to  reimburse  an
Issuing  Bank for amounts  actually  paid or to be paid by such  Issuing Bank in
respect of a Letter of Credit or L/C Draft,  shall be  returned  to the  Company
within one (1)  Business  Day (after  deduction  of the  Administrative  Agent's
expenses incurred in connection with such cash collateral account).


ARTICLE IV:  CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

     4.1 Yield Protection.  If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental
rule,  regulation,  policy,  guideline or  directive  (whether or not having the
force of law) adopted after the date of this Agreement or any  interpretation or
application   thereof   by  any   Governmental   Authority   charged   with  the
interpretation  or  application   thereof,  or  the  compliance  of  any  Lender
therewith,  subjects any Lender or any applicable  Lending  Installation  to any
tax,  duty,  charge or  withholding  on or from  payments  due from any Borrower
(excluding  taxation  of the  overall  net income of any Lender or taxation of a
similar basis,  which are governed by Section 2.14(e)),  or changes the basis of
taxation of payments to any Lender in respect of its Revolving Loan  Commitment,
Loans,  its L/C  Interests,  the  Letters  of  Credit  or other  amounts  due it
hereunder, or imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,  assessment,
insurance  charge,  special  deposit or similar  requirement  against assets of,
deposits  with or for the account of, or credit  extended  by, any Lender or any
applicable Lending  Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency  Rate Loans)
with respect to its  Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  Loans,  L/C  Interests or the
Letters of  Credit,  or imposes  any other  condition  the result of which is to
increase  the cost to any  Lender  or any  applicable  Lending  Installation  of
making,  funding or maintaining its Revolving Loan  Commitment,  Loans,  the L/C
Interests or the Letters of Credit or reduces any amount  received by any Lender
or any applicable  Lending  Installation  in connection  with its Revolving Loan
Commitment, Loans or Letters of Credit, or requires any Lender or any applicable
Lending  Installation to make any payment  calculated by reference to the amount
of Revolving Loan Commitment,  Loans or L/C Interests held or interest  received
by it or by reference to the Letters of Credit,  by an amount deemed material by
such Lender;  and the result of any of the  foregoing is to increase the cost to
that Lender of making,  renewing or maintaining  its Revolving Loan  Commitment,
Loans,  L/C  Interests,  or Letters  of Credit or to reduce any amount  received
under this  Agreement,  then,  within  fifteen  (15) days  after  receipt by the
Company or any other  Borrower  of written  demand by such  Lender  pursuant  to
Section 4.5, the applicable Borrowers shall pay such Lender that portion of such
increased  expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such Lender
reasonably  determines is  attributable  to making,  funding and maintaining its
Loans, L/C Interests, Letters of Credit and its Revolving Loan Commitment.

         4.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines (a)
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender,  any
Lending  Installation of such Lender or any corporation  controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a "Change" (as defined below), and (b) such increase
in capital will result in an increase in the cost to such Lender of  maintaining
its Revolving Loan Commitment,  Loans,  L/C Interests,  the Letters of Credit or
its  obligation to make Loans  hereunder,  then,  within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Company or any other  Borrower  of written  demand by such Lender
pursuant to Section  4.5,  the  applicable  Borrowers  shall pay such Lender the
amount  necessary to  compensate  for any shortfall in the rate of return on the
portion of such  increased  capital which such Lender  reasonably  determines is
attributable to this Agreement,  its Revolving Loan  Commitment,  its Loans, its
L/C Interests,  the Letters of Credit or its obligation to make Loans  hereunder
(after  taking into  account  such  Lender's  policies as to capital  adequacy).
"Change"  means  (i)  any  change  after  the  date  of  this  Agreement  in the
"Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" (as defined below) excluding,  for the avoidance
of doubt, the effect of any phasing in of such Risk-Based  Capital Guidelines or
any other  capital  requirements  passed prior to the date  hereof,  or (ii) any
adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation,  policy,  guideline,  interpretation,  or directive  (whether or not
having  the force of law) after the date of this  Agreement  which  affects  the
amount of capital  required or expected  to be  maintained  by any Lender or any
Lending  Installation  or any corporation  controlling  any Lender.  "Risk-Based
Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the
United States on the date of this Agreement,  including  transition  rules,  and
(ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities
outside  the  United  States  implementing  the July  1988  report  of the Basle
Committee   on   Banking   Regulation   and   Supervisory   Practices   Entitled
"International  Convergence  of Capital  Measurements  and  Capital  Standards,"
including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior
to the date of this Agreement.

         4.3  Availability  of Types of Advances.  If (a) any Lender  determines
that  maintenance  of  its  Eurocurrency   Rate  Loans  at  a  suitable  Lending
Installation  would violate any applicable  law, rule,  regulation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, or (b) the  Required  Lenders  determine
that (i)  deposits of a type,  currency or  maturity  appropriate  to match fund
Fixed-Rate  Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to a
Fixed-Rate Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining
such an Advance, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of
the  affected  Type of Advance and, in the case of any  occurrence  set forth in
clause (a),  require any Advances of the affected Type to be repaid or converted
into another Type.

         4.4 Funding  Indemnification.  If any payment of a  Fixed-Rate  Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period,
whether  because of  acceleration,  prepayment,  or  otherwise,  or a Fixed-Rate
Advance is not made on the date  specified  by the  applicable  Borrower for any
reason other than default by the Lenders,  the Borrowers  shall  indemnify  each
Lender  for any loss or cost  incurred  by it  resulting  therefrom,  including,
without  limitation,  any  loss or cost in  liquidating  or  employing  deposits
acquired  to fund or  maintain  the  Fixed-Rate  Advance or Swing Line Loan,  as
applicable.

         4.5 Lender Statements;  Survival of Indemnity.  If reasonably possible,
each Lender shall designate an alternate  Lending  Installation  with respect to
its  Fixed-Rate  Loans to reduce any  liability  of any  Borrower to such Lender
under Sections 4.1 and 4.2 or to avoid the  unavailability  of a Type of Advance
under  Section  4.3,  so long  as such  designation  is  not,  in such  Lender's
judgment,  disadvantageous to such Lender. Any demand for compensation  pursuant
to this  Article IV shall be in writing  and shall state the amount due, if any,
under  Section  4.1,  4.2 or 4.4 and shall set forth in  reasonable  detail  the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount.  Such written demand
shall be rebuttably presumed correct for all purposes.  Determination of amounts
payable  under such  Sections  in  connection  with a  Fixed-Rate  Loan shall be
calculated as though each Lender funded its Fixed-Rate Loan through the purchase
of a deposit of the type,  currency  and maturity  corresponding  to the deposit
used as a reference  in  determining  the  Fixed-Rate  applicable  to such Loan,
whether in fact that is the case or not. The  obligations of the Company and the
other  Borrowers  under  Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 shall survive  payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE V:  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

ARTICLE VI:  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         In order to induce the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders to enter
into this  Agreement,  to continue the Existing Loans  hereunder and to make the
Loans and the other financial  accommodations  to the Borrowers and to issue the
Letters  of  Credit  described  herein,  each of the  Borrowers  represents  and
warrants as follows to each Lender and the  Administrative  Agent as of the date
of  this  Agreement,  giving  effect  to the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated by the Loan  Documents,  and thereafter on each date as required by
Sections 5.2 and 5.3:

         6.1  Organization;  Corporate  Powers.  Each  of the  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of formation and has all requisite authority to conduct
its business in each  jurisdiction  in which its business is  conducted,  except
where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.2  Authorization  and  Validity.  Each of the  Loan  Parties  has the
requisite  power and  authority  and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan
Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder.  The
execution  and  delivery by each of the Loan  Parties of the Loan  Documents  to
which it is a party and the performance of its obligations  thereunder have been
duly authorized by proper  proceedings,  and the Loan Documents to which it is a
party  constitute  legal,  valid  and  binding  obligations  of each of the Loan
Parties  enforceable  against each of the Loan Parties in accordance  with their
terms,  except as  enforceability  may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

         6.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery
by  the  Loan  Parties  of the  Loan  Documents,  nor  the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  thereby,  nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any law,  rule,  regulation,  order,  writ,  judgment,  injunction,
decree or award binding on the Company or any Subsidiary or the Company's or any
Subsidiary's   articles  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  or  other  constitutive
documents and agreements or the provisions of any material indenture, instrument
or agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or
by which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  pursuant to the terms of any
such indenture,  instrument or agreement. No order, consent, approval,  license,
authorization,  or validation of, or filing,  recording or registration with, or
exemption by, any  governmental or public body or authority,  or any subdivision
thereof,  is required to authorize any Loan Party, or is required to be obtained
by any Loan Party in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of,
or the legality,  validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan
Documents.

         6.4 Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial statements
of the Company and its  Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended January 2, 1998,
January 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999 were prepared in accordance with Agreement
Accounting  Principles and fairly present the consolidated  financial  condition
and  operations  of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  at such  dates  and the
consolidated results of their operations for the periods then ended.

         6.5  Material  Adverse  Change.  Since  December  31,  2001,  there has
occurred no change in the business,  assets, liabilities (actual or contingent),
operations,  condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, of the Company, or
the Company and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole, or any other event which has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.6  Taxes.  The  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other material tax returns which are required
to be filed and have paid all taxes due  pursuant to said returns or pursuant to
any assessment received by the Company or any Subsidiary,  except such taxes, if
any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have
been  provided.  No tax liens have been  filed and no claims are being  asserted
with respect to any such taxes. The charges,  accruals and reserves on the books
of  the  Company  and  the  Subsidiaries  in  respect  of  any  taxes  or  other
governmental charges are adequate.

         6.7  Litigation  and  Contingent  Obligations.  There is no litigation,
arbitration,  governmental  investigation,  proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the  knowledge of any of the  Borrowers,  threatened  against or  affecting  the
Company  or  any of its  Subsidiaries  (a)  challenging  the  Spectra  Precision
Acquisition or the validity or enforceability  of any material  provision of the
Loan  Documents  or (b) which  could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse  Effect.  There is no material  loss  contingency  within the meaning of
Agreement Accounting Principles which has not been reflected in the consolidated
financial  statements  of the  Company or  prepared  and  delivered  pursuant to
Section 7.1(a) for the fiscal period during which such material loss contingency
was incurred.  Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is subject to or
in default with respect to any final  judgment,  writ,  injunction,  restraining
order  or  order of any  nature,  decree,  rule or  regulation  of any  court or
Governmental  Authority  which could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         6.8 Subsidiaries.  Schedule 6.8 hereto contains an accurate list of all
of the Subsidiaries of the Company in existence on the Amendment Effective Date,
setting forth their respective  jurisdictions of formation and the percentage of
their  respective  capital stock owned  directly or indirectly by the Company or
other  Subsidiaries.  All of the issued and  outstanding  Capital  Stock of such
Subsidiaries  have been  duly  authorized  and  issued  and are  fully  paid and
non-assessable.  Except as set forth on Schedule 6.8, no authorized but unissued
or treasury shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary are subject to any option,
warrant,  right to call or commitment  of any kind or  character.  Except as set
forth  on  Schedule  6.8,  neither  the  Company  nor  any  Subsidiary  has  any
outstanding stock or securities  convertible into or exchangeable for any shares
of its capital stock,  or any right issued to any Person  (either  preemptive or
other) to subscribe  for or to purchase,  or any options for the purchase of, or
any agreements  providing for the issuance  (contingent or otherwise) of, or any
calls,  commitments  or claims of any  character  relating to any of its capital
stock or any stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of its
capital stock other than as expressly set forth in the  certificate  or articles
of incorporation of the Company or such Subsidiary.  Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is subject to any obligation  (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase
or  otherwise  acquire  or  retire  any  shares  of  its  capital  stock  or any
convertible securities, rights or options of the type described in the preceding
sentence  except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 6.8.  Except as set forth on
Schedule  6.8, as of the date hereof the Company does not own or hold,  directly
or  indirectly,  any  capital  stock or equity  security  of,  or any  equity or
partnership interest in any Person other than such Subsidiaries.

         6.9 ERISA.  As at December  31, 1999 the  Unfunded  Liabilities  of all
Single  Employer  Plans did not in the aggregate  exceed  $5,000,000.  Each Plan
complies and has been  maintained in all material  respects with all  applicable
requirements  of law and  regulations.  No  Reportable  Event has occurred  with
respect to any Single  Employer Plan having any Unfunded  Liability which has or
may  reasonably be expected to result in a liability to the Company in excess of
$10,000,000.  Neither the Company nor any other members of the Controlled  Group
has  terminated  any Single  Employer Plan without in each instance  funding all
vested benefit obligations  thereunder.  Each member of the Controlled Group has
fulfilled its minimum  funding  obligations  with respect to each  Multiemployer
Plan.  No  Termination  Event has occurred or is  reasonably  expected to occur.
There are no material  actions,  suits or claims (other than routine  claims for
benefits)  pending  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company or its  Subsidiaries,
threatened with respect to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan.

         6.10 Accuracy of Information. None of the (a) information,  exhibits or
reports  furnished or to be furnished  by the Company or any  Subsidiary  to the
Administrative  Agent or to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the
Loan  Documents,  or (b)  representations  or  warranties  of the Company or any
Subsidiary  contained in this  Agreement,  the other Loan Documents or any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to the Administrative Agent
or the  Lenders  by or on behalf of the  Company  or any  Subsidiary  for use in
connection with the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  contained,
contains or will  contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitted,
omits  or will  omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  in order to make the
statements   contained  herein  or  therein  not  misleading  in  light  of  the
circumstances  in which the same were made. The pro forma financial  information
contained in such materials is based upon good faith  estimates and  assumptions
believed  by the  Company to be  reasonable  at the time made.  There is no fact
known to the Company (other than matters of a general  economic nature) that has
had or could  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect and that
has not been  disclosed  herein or in such  other  documents,  certificates  and
statements  furnished to the Lenders for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  No information,  exhibit or report furnished by
the Company or any  Subsidiary to any  Administrative  Agent or to any Lender in
connection  with the  negotiation  of, or compliance  with, the Loan  Documents,
contained any material  misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact
or any fact  necessary to make the statements  contained  therein not materially
misleading.

         6.11  Regulation  U. Margin  Stock  constitutes  less than 25% of those
assets of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  which are subject to any limitation
on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder.

         6.12  Material   Agreements.   Neither  the  Company  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries is a party to any  Contractual  Obligation the performance of which
could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither the
Company  nor  any  of its  Subsidiaries  is  subject  to any  charter  or  other
restriction in any  constitutive  agreement or document  affecting its business,
properties,  financial condition, prospects or results of operations which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is in default in the  performance,  observance or fulfillment
of any of the obligations,  covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual
Obligation to which it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.13  Compliance  With Laws.  The  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  have
complied  with  all   Requirements  of  Law  except  to  the  extent  that  such
non-compliance  could not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material  Adverse
Effect.  Neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary  has received any notice to the
effect that its operations are not in material  compliance with any Requirements
of Law or the subject of any federal or state  investigation  evaluating whether
any remedial  action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous
waste or substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.14  Ownership of  Properties.  On the Amendment  Effective  Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries  have good title,  free of all Liens, to all of the
properties  and assets  reflected in its  December  31, 2001  audited  financial
statements as owned by it (other than  properties and assets  disposed of in the
ordinary  course of business  since such date),  except  Liens  permitted  under
Section 7.3(c).

         6.15 Statutory Indebtedness  Restrictions.  Neither the Company nor any
of its  Subsidiaries  is subject to regulation  under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate  Commerce Act, or the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  or any  other  federal  or state  statute  or
regulation  which  limits its  ability to incur  indebtedness  or its ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         6.16 Environmental Matters. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with all Environmental,  Health or Safety  Requirements of Laws in
effect in each jurisdiction where it is presently doing business and as to which
the  failure  to so  comply,  in the  aggregate  for all  such  failures,  would
reasonably  be likely to  subject  the  Company to  liability  that would have a
Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to
any liability under the Environmental,  Health or Safety Requirements of Laws in
effect in any  jurisdiction  where it is  presently  doing  business  that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any:


         (a)  notice  from  any  Governmental  Authority  by  which  any  of the
         Company's or such Subsidiary's  present or  previously-owned  or leased
         property  has been  identified  in any manner by any such  Governmental
         Authority as a hazardous  substance  disposal or removal  site,  "Super
         Fund" clean-up site or candidate for removal or closure pursuant to any
         Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law; or

         (b)  notice  of any  Lien  arising  under  or in  connection  with  any
         Environmental,  Health or Safety  Requirements of Law that has attached
         to any of the Company's or such  Subsidiary's  owned or leased property
         or any revenues of the Company's or such  Subsidiary's  owned or leased
         property; or

         (c)  communication,  written or oral, from any  Governmental  Authority
         concerning  action or  omission by the  Company or such  Subsidiary  in
         connection  with its ownership or leasing of any property  resulting in
         the release of any  hazardous  substance  resulting in any violation of
         any Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements of Law;

where  the  effect  of  which,  in  the  aggregate  for  all  such  notices  and
communications, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.17  Insurance.  The properties and assets and business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable  insurance
companies  not  Subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  in  such  amounts,   with  such
deductibles  and  covering  such risks as are  customarily  carried by companies
engaged in similar businesses and are similarly situated.

         6.18  Labor  Matters.  As of the  Amendment  Effective  Date,  no labor
disputes,  strikes or walkouts affecting the operations of the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries,  are pending,  or, to the  Company's  knowledge,  threatened,
planned or  contemplated  which could  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         6.19 Solvency. After giving effect to (i) the extensions of credit made
hereunder  on the Closing Date or such other date as Loans  requested  hereunder
were made,  (ii) the other  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, including the Spectra Precision Acquisition, and (iii) the
payment and accrual of all transaction costs with respect to the foregoing,  the
Company and its Subsidiaries are Solvent.

          6.20  Default.  No Default or  Unmatured  Default has  occurred and is
continuing.

          6.21  Foreign  Employee  Benefit  Matters.

          (a)  Each  Foreign  Employee  Benefit  Plan  is in  compliance  in all
          material  respects  with all laws,  regulations  and rules  applicable
          thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents for
          such Plan;

          (b) the aggregate of the  accumulated  benefit  obligations  under all
          Foreign  Pension  Plans  does not  exceed to any  material  extent the
          current  fair market value of the assets held in the trusts or similar
          funding vehicles for such Plans;

          (c) with  respect to any Foreign  Employee  Benefit Plan (other than a
          Foreign Pension Plan),  reasonable  reserves have been  established in
          accordance  with  prudent  business  practice  or  where  required  by
          ordinary  accounting  practices in the jurisdiction in which such Plan
          is maintained;  and (d) there are no material actions, suits or claims
          (other than routine claims for benefits)  pending or, to the knowledge
          of the Company and its Subsidiaries, threatened against the Company or
          any  Subsidiary  of it or any  member  of its  Controlled  Group  with
          respect to any Foreign Employee Benefit Plan.

         6.22  Acquisition  Documents.  The Acquisition  Documents as originally
executed and  delivered by the parties  thereto have not been  amended,  waived,
supplemented or modified  without the consent of the  Administrative  Agent. The
representations  and  warranties  of the Company set forth  therein  and, to the
knowledge  of the  Company,  the  representations  and  warranties  of the other
parties set forth  therein are true and correct in all  material  respects as of
the date  thereof.  On the date of this  Agreement,  neither the Company nor any
other party to any of the Acquisition Documents is in default in the performance
of or  compliance  with any  provisions  under the  Acquisition  Documents.  The
Spectra Precision Acquisition (other than certain modifications to the corporate
structure  of the  Seller's  European  holdings  in a manner  acceptable  to the
Administrative  Agent) has been  consummated in accordance  with applicable laws
and regulations.

         6.23  Collateral Documents. All representations and  warranties  of the
Borrowers contained in the Collateral Documents are true and correct.

         6.24 Security. The provisions of the Collateral Documents are effective
to create and give the Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as
security for the repayment of the obligations  secured thereby, a legal,  valid,
perfected and  enforceable  Lien (which  priority is subject only to prior Liens
permitted by such agreements) upon all right,  title and interest of the Company
and its  Subsidiaries in any and all of the Collateral  described  therein.  The
Mortgages,  upon their  execution and delivery,  will be effective to create and
give the Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,  as security for
repayment of the obligations to be secured thereby,  a legal,  valid,  perfected
and  enforceable  Lien  (which  priority  will be  subject  only to prior  Liens
permitted by such mortgages) upon all right, title and interest of the Borrowers
in the Collateral described therein. The Pledge Agreement is effective to create
and give the Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,  as security
for the repayment of the obligations secured thereby, a legal, valid,  perfected
and  enforceable  first priority Lien upon and security  interest in the capital
stock pledged thereby.

         6.25 Subordinated Seller Debt. Each Borrower incurring the same has the
corporate  power  and  authority  to incur  the  Indebtedness  evidenced  by the
Subordinated  Seller Debt.  The  subordination  provisions  of the  Subordinated
Seller Debt will be enforceable  against the holders of the Subordinated  Seller
Debt by any Holder of Obligations which has not effectively  waived the benefits
thereof.  All  Obligations,  including the  Obligations  to pay principal of and
interest on the Loans,  constitute senior Indebtedness  entitled to the benefits
of  subordination  created  by  the  Subordinated  Seller  Debt.  The  Borrowers
acknowledge that the Administrative Agent and each Lender are entering into this
Agreement and are extending the Aggregate  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  and Term
Loans in reliance upon the subordination  provisions of the Subordinated  Seller
Note and this Section 6.25.

         6.26 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.8, each Subsidiary
of the Company is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary.

         6.27  Representations  and  Warranties of each  Subsidiary  Borrower.
Each Subsidiary Borrower further represents and warrants to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders that:

         (a) Organization and Corporate Powers.  Such Subsidiary Borrower (i) is
         a company duly formed and validly  existing and in good standing  under
         the laws of the state or country of its organization (such jurisdiction
         being  hereinafter  referred  to as the "Home  Country");  (ii) has the
         requisite  power and  authority  to own its  property and assets and to
         carry on its business  substantially  as now conducted except where the
         failure  to have such  requisite  authority  would not have a  material
         adverse effect on such Subsidiary Borrower; and (iii) has the requisite
         power  and  authority  and  legal  right to  execute  and  deliver  any
         Alternate  Currency Addendum to which it is a party and each other Loan
         Document  to  which  it is a  party  and the  performance  by it of its
         obligations  thereunder have been duly  authorized by proper  corporate
         proceedings.

         (b) Binding Effect. Each Loan Document,  including, without limitation,
         any Alternate Currency Addendum,  executed by such Subsidiary  Borrower
         is the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Subsidiary Borrower
         enforceable  in  accordance  with  their  respective  terms,  except as
         enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
         affecting the  enforcement of creditors'  rights  generally and general
         equitable principles.

         (c) No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery
         by such  Subsidiary  Borrower  of the Loan  Documents  to which it is a
         party,  nor  the  consummation  by  it  of  the  transactions   therein
         contemplated to be consummated by it, nor compliance by such Subsidiary
         Borrower  with the  provisions  thereof  will  violate  any law,  rule,
         regulation, order, writ, judgment,  injunction, decree or award binding
         on  such  Subsidiary  Borrower  or  any  of its  Subsidiaries  or  such
         Subsidiary Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' memoranda or articles
         of  association  or the  provisions  of any  indenture,  instrument  or
         agreement to which such Subsidiary  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its property, is bound, or
         conflict  with or  constitute  a default  thereunder,  or result in the
         creation or  imposition  of any lien in, of or on the  property of such
         Subsidiary Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of
         any such  indenture,  instrument  or  agreement  in any such case which
         violation,  conflict,  default, creation or imposition could reasonably
         be  expected  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on such  Subsidiary
         Borrower.  No order,  consent,  approval,  license,  authorization,  or
         validation of, or filing,  recording or registration with, or exemption
         by, any governmental agency is required to authorize, or is required in
         connection  with the  execution,  delivery and  performance  of, or the
         legality,  validity,  binding effect or  enforceability  of, any of the
         Loan Documents.

         (d) Filing.  To ensure the  enforceability or admissibility in evidence
         of this  Agreement  and each Loan  Document  to which  such  Subsidiary
         Borrower  is a party  (including,  without  limitation,  any  Alternate
         Currency  Addendum) in its Home Country,  it is not necessary that this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document to which such Subsidiary  Borrower
         is a party or any other document be filed or recorded with any court or
         other authority in its Home Country or that any stamp or similar tax be
         paid to or in respect of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document of
         such  Subsidiary  Borrower.  The  qualification  by any  Lender  or the
         Administrative  Agent for  admission  to do business  under the laws of
         such Subsidiary Borrower's Home Country does not constitute a condition
         to, and the failure to so qualify does not affect,  the exercise by any
         Lender or the Administrative Agent of any right,  privilege,  or remedy
         afforded to any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent in connection with
         the Loan Documents to which such Subsidiary  Borrower is a party or the
         enforcement  of any such  right,  privilege,  or  remedy  against  such
         Subsidiary   Borrower.   The   performance   by  any   Lender   or  the
         Administrative Agent of any action required or permitted under the Loan
         Documents will not (i) violate any law or regulation of such Subsidiary
         Borrower's  Home Country or any  political  subdivision  thereof,  (ii)
         result in any tax or other monetary liability to such party pursuant to
         the  laws of such  Subsidiary  Borrower's  Home  Country  or  political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof (provided that, should any such
         action result in any such tax or other monetary liability to the Lender
         or the  Administrative  Agent,  the Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify
         such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent,  as the case may be, against
         (x) any such tax or other  monetary  liability  and (y) any increase in
         any tax or other monetary  liability  which results from such action by
         such  Lender  or  the  Administrative  Agent  and,  to the  extent  the
         Borrowers make such  indemnification,  the incurrence of such liability
         by the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  will  not  constitute  a
         Default) or (iii) violate any rule or  regulation of any  federation or
         organization or similar entity of which the such Subsidiary  Borrower's
         Home Country is a member.

         (e) No Immunity. Neither such Subsidiary Borrower nor any of its assets
         is entitled to immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal
         process.  Such Subsidiary Borrower's execution and delivery of the Loan
         Documents  to which it is a party  constitute,  and the exercise of its
         rights and  performance of and compliance  with its  obligations  under
         such Loan Documents will  constitute,  private and commercial acts done
         and performed for private and commercial purposes.

         (f) Application of Representations and Warranties. It is understood and
         agreed by the parties hereto that the representations and warranties of
         each Subsidiary Borrower (other than any Subsidiary Borrower that shall
         be a Subsidiary  Borrower as of the Amendment  Effective  Date) in this
         Section 6.27 shall only be  applicable to such  Subsidiary  Borrower on
         and after the date of its  execution  of an  Assumption  Letter and, if
         applicable, an Alternate Currency Addendum.

         principles,  on a consolidated and  consolidating  basis for itself and

         appropriate   supporting   details  and  a  statement   of   underlying
         assumptions,  all in form  similar to those  delivered  to the  Lenders
         prior to the Closing Date.

         other than the businesses  engaged in by the Company on the date hereof

          continuing or would result from such  Acquisition or the incurrence of
          any Indebtedness in connection therewith;

               (ii)  the  purchase  is  consummated  pursuant  to  a  negotiated
          acquisition  agreement  on a  non-hostile  basis and  approved  by the

          prior to the consummation of the Acquisition;

               (iii)  if the  purchase  price  payable  in  respect  to any such
          Acquisition (including,  without limitation, cash or stock (other than
          Equity  Interests  (other  than  Disqualified  Stock) of the  Company)
          consideration  paid and  Indebtedness  or other  liabilities  assumed)
          exceeds $25,000,000, prior to each such Acquisition, the Company shall
          have  delivered  to  the  Administrative   Agent  and  the  Lenders  a
          certificate from one of the Authorized  Officers,  demonstrating  that
          after  giving  effect to such  Acquisition,  on a pro  forma  basis in
          respect  of each  such  Acquisition  as if the  Acquisition  and  such
          incurrence  of  Indebtedness  had  occurred  on the  first  day of the
          twelve-month  period  ending  on the  last day of the  Company's  most
          recently  completed  fiscal  quarter,  the Company  would have been in
          compliance  with  the  financial  covenants  in  Section  7.4  and not
          otherwise in Default;

                (iv) if the  purchase  price  for the  Acquisition  (excluding
         consideration in the form of the Company's Equity Interests (other than
         Disqualified  Stock))  exceeds,   together  with  all  other  Permitted
         Acquisitions permitted under this Section 7.3(f) during the same fiscal
         year,  $25,000,000 (the "Permitted  Acquisition Basket") (including the
         incurrence or assumption of any Indebtedness in connection  therewith),
         the Required Lenders shall have consented to such Acquisition;

               (v) the businesses being acquired shall be similar to that of the
          Company  and its  Subsidiaries  as of the  Closing  Date,  related  or
          incidental thereto or logical extensions thereof; and

               (vi)  such   Acquisition   shall  be   structured   as  an  asset
          acquisition,  as an acquisition  of one hundred  percent (100%) of the

         in, any Person, or make or commit to make any advance,  loan, extension
         of credit or capital  contribution  to or any other  investment in, any
         Person including any Affiliate of the Company, except for:

               (i)   Investments  by  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  in  any
          Wholly-Owned Subsidiary which is a Guarantor;

               (ii)  Investments  incurred  in  order  to  consummate  Permitted
          Acquisitions otherwise permitted herein;

          permitted hereunder.


         (h) Transactions with Shareholders and Affiliates.  Neither the Company
         nor any of its Subsidiaries  shall directly or indirectly enter into or
         permit to exist any transaction  (including,  without  limitation,  the
         purchase,  sale,  lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
         any service)  with,  or make loans or advances to, any Affiliate of the
         Company  which is not its  Wholly-Owned  Subsidiary,  on terms that are
         less  favorable  to  the  Company  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,   as
         applicable,  than  those  that  might be  obtained  in an arm's  length
         transaction  at the time  from  Persons  who are not  such a holder  or
         Affiliate, except for Restricted Payments permitted by Section 7.3(f).

         shall be the surviving  corporation);  provided that if the predecessor
         Subsidiary was a Guarantor,  the surviving  Subsidiary,  if applicable,
         shall be a Guarantor hereunder, (iii) any liquidation of any Subsidiary
         of the Company into the Company or another  Subsidiary  of the Company,
         as applicable, and (iv) the Company may merge with any other Person, or

         immediately  before or after giving effect to such Fundamental  Change,
         (B) in the  case of any  merger  of the  Company,  the  Company  is the
         surviving  corporation  in such merger and such merger is with a Person
         in a line of business  substantially similar to that of the Company and

         which are similar,  related or incidental thereto or logical extensions
         thereof,  and (C) in the case of any  merger  or  consolidation  of any
         Subsidiary  of  the  Company,   the  surviving   corporation   in  such

         of ERISA;

                  (E) fail to make any material  contribution  or payment to any

         liabilities  are  being  funded  by  annual  contributions  made by the
         Company  or  any  member  of  its  Controlled  Group  and  such  annual
         contributions  are not less than the minimum amounts,  if any, required

          liability, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of $5,000,000.


         (l) Certain Documents.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
         shall amend,  modify or otherwise change any of the terms or provisions
         of  (i)  the  Acquisition  Documents,  or of any  of  their  respective
         constituent  documents  as in effect on the date  hereof in any  manner
         materially  adverse  to  the  interests  of the  Lenders  or  (ii)  the
         documents evidencing the Subordinated Seller Debt.

         (m)  Fiscal  Year.  Neither  the  Company  nor any of its  consolidated
         Subsidiaries  shall  change  its  fiscal  year  for  accounting  or tax
         purposes from a period consisting of the twelve-month  period ending on
         Friday  nearest to  December  31 of each year,  except as  required  by
         Agreement Accounting  Principles or by law and disclosed to the Lenders
         and the Administrative Agent.

         (n) Hedging Obligations. The Company shall not and shall not permit any
         of its  Subsidiaries  to enter into any  interest  rate,  commodity  or
         foreign currency  exchange,  swap,  collar,  cap or similar  agreements
         evidencing  Hedging  Obligations,  other than  interest  rate,  foreign
         currency or commodity exchange, swap, collar, cap or similar agreements
         entered into by the Company or its  Subsidiaries  pursuant to which the
         Company  or its  Subsidiaries  has  hedged  its  actual or  anticipated
         interest rate, foreign currency or commodity  exposure.  Such permitted
         hedging  agreements entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries and
         any Lender or any  Affiliate  of any Lender are  sometimes  referred to
         herein as "Hedging Agreements".

         (o) Capital  Expenditures.  The Company shall not, and shall not permit
         any of its  Subsidiaries  to, make Capital  Expenditures  in any fiscal

         $15,000,000,   excluding  any  amount   attributable   to  a  Permitted
         Acquisition (the "Capital  Expenditures  Limit").  Notwithstanding  the
         foregoing,  in the event that the Company and its  Subsidiaries  do not
         expend the entire Capital  Expenditures  Limit for any fiscal year, the
         Company  and its  Subsidiaries  may carry  forward  to the  immediately

         2.23 hereof or the  disposition  of such  Guarantor in any  transaction
         permitted by Section 7.3(b) hereof.

         collateral purported to be covered thereby,  except as permitted by the

ARTICLE IX:  ACCELERATION, DEFAULTING LENDERS; WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

         9.1  Termination of Revolving Loan  Commitments;  Acceleration.  If any
Default described in Section 8.1(e) or 8.1(f) occurs with respect to the Company
or any  Subsidiary  Borrower,  the  obligations  of the  Lenders  to make  Loans
(including,  without  limitation,  Alternate  Currency Loans)  hereunder and the
obligation  of any  Issuing  Banks to issue  Letters of Credit  hereunder  shall
automatically  terminate and the Obligations  shall  immediately  become due and
payable without any election or action on the part of the  Administrative  Agent
or any  Lender.  If any other  Default  occurs,  the  Required  Lenders,  or the
Administrative  Agent  acting  at the  direction  of the  Required  Lenders  may
terminate or suspend the  obligations  of the Lenders to make Loans  (including,
without  limitation,  Alternate  Currency Loans) hereunder and the obligation of
the  Issuing  Banks to  issue  Letters  of  Credit  hereunder,  or  declare  the
Obligations  to be due and payable,  or both,  whereupon the  Obligations  shall
become  immediately due and payable,  without  presentment,  demand,  protest or
notice of any kind, all of which the Borrowers expressly waive.

         9.2  Amendments.  Subject to the  provisions  of this  Article  IX, the
Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the
Required  Lenders)  and the  Borrowers  may enter into  agreements  supplemental
hereto  for the  purpose  of  adding or  modifying  any  provisions  to the Loan
Documents  or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the  Borrowers
hereunder or waiving any Default or Unmatured Default  hereunder;  provided that
no such  supplemental  agreement  shall,  without  the  consent  of each  Lender
directly affected thereby:

          (a) Postpone or extend the Revolving Loan  Termination  Date, the Term
          Loan  Maturity  Date or any other date  scheduled  for any  payment of
          principal of, or interest on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations
          or any fees or other  amounts  payable  to such  Lender  (except  with
          respect to a waiver of the application of the default rate of interest
          pursuant to Section 2.12 hereof).

          (b) Reduce the principal  amount of any Loans or L/C  Obligations,  or
          reduce  the rate or extend the time of  payment  of  interest  or fees
          thereon.

          (c) Reduce the  percentage  specified  in the  definition  of Required
          Lenders or any other percentage of Lenders  hereunder  specified to be
          the  applicable  percentage  in  this  Agreement  to act on  specified
          matters or amend the  definitions  of  "Required  Lenders",  "Pro Rata
          Revolving Share",  "Pro Rata Share",  "Pro Rata Term Share", "Pro Rata
          Tranche A Revolving Share", "Pro Rata Tranche B Revolving Share", "Pro
          Rata  Tranche C  Revolving  Share" or "Pro  Rata  Tranche D  Revolving
          Share".

          (d) Increase the amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment of any Lender
          hereunder.

          (e) Permit the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower to assign its rights
          under this Agreement or any Guaranty.

          (f) Release the Company or any Guarantor  from any of its  obligations
          under  the  Guaranty  set  forth  in  Article  X hereof  or any  other
          Guaranty.

          (g) Amend this Section 9.2.

          (h) Release all or a  substantial  portion of the  collateral  pledged
          pursuant to the  Collateral  Documents  (except as expressly  provided
          therein).

          (i) Amend the definition of "Trigger Event Date".

         No amendment of any  provision  of this  Agreement  relating to (a) the
Administrative  Agent shall be  effective  without  the  written  consent of the
Administrative  Agent,  (b) any  Issuing  Bank shall be  effective  without  the
written  consent  of such  Issuing  Bank and (c) any Swing  Line  Loan  shall be
effective without the written consent of the Swing Line Bank. The Administrative
Agent may waive  payment  of the fee  required  under  Section  14.3(b)  without
obtaining the consent of any of the Lenders.

         9.3 Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be  construed  to be a waiver of any  Default  or an  acquiescence
therein,  and the  making  of a Loan  or the  issuance  of a  Letter  of  Credit
notwithstanding  the  existence of a Default or the  inability of the Company or
any other Borrower to satisfy the conditions  precedent to such Loan or issuance
of such Letter of Credit shall not  constitute any waiver or  acquiescence.  Any
single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or
other  variation of the terms,  conditions or  provisions of the Loan  Documents
whatsoever  shall be valid unless in writing  signed by the requisite  number of
Lenders  required  pursuant to Section  9.2, and then only to the extent in such
writing  specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or
by  law  afforded  shall  be  cumulative  and  all  shall  be  available  to the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  until the  Obligations  have been paid in
full.


ARTICLE X:  GUARANTY

         10.1  Guaranty.  For  valuable  consideration,  the receipt of which is
hereby  acknowledged,  and to  induce  the  Lenders  to  make  advances  to each
Subsidiary  Borrower and to make,  issue and  participate  in Letters of Credit,
Swing Line Loans and Alternate Currency Loans, the Company hereby absolutely and
unconditionally  guarantees prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity,
upon  acceleration  or otherwise,  and at all times  thereafter,  of any and all
existing and future obligations including without limitation the Obligations, of
each Subsidiary  Borrower to the  Administrative  Agent, the Lenders,  the Swing
Line Bank, the Issuing  Lenders,  the Alternate  Currency Banks, or any of them,
under or with  respect  to the Loan  Documents  or under or with  respect to any
Hedging  Agreement  entered into in connection with this Agreement,  whether for
principal,  interest, (including interest accruing after the commencement of any
bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding whether or not allowed as a claim in
such  proceeding)  fees,  expenses or otherwise  (collectively,  the "Guaranteed
Obligations",   and  each  such  Subsidiary  Borrower  being  an  "Obligor"  and
collectively, the "Obligors").

         10.2  Waivers.  The Company  waives  notice of the  acceptance  of this
guaranty and of the extension or continuation  of the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any part thereof.  The Company further waives  presentment,  protest,  notice of
notices  delivered  or demand  made on any Obligor or action or  delinquency  in
respect of the Guaranteed  Obligations or any part thereof,  including any right
to require  the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders to sue any  Obligor,  any
other  guarantor or any other Person  obligated  with respect to the  Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof, or otherwise to enforce payment thereof against
any  collateral  securing the Guaranteed  Obligations  or any part thereof.  The
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  shall have no  obligation  to disclose or
discuss with the Company their  assessments  of the  financial  condition of the
Obligors.

         10.3 Guaranty Absolute.  This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not
of collection, is a primary obligation of the Company and not one of surety, and
the  validity  and  enforceability  of  this  guaranty  shall  be  absolute  and
unconditional  irrespective  of, and shall not be impaired or affected by any of
the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with
respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof
or any agreement  relating  thereto at any time;  (b) any failure or omission to
enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or
any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto,  or any collateral;  (c) any
waiver of any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed  Obligations
or any part  thereof or any  agreement  relating  thereto or with respect to any
collateral;  (d)  any  release,  surrender,   compromise,   settlement,  waiver,

any other  guaranties  with respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any part
thereof,  or any other  obligation of any Person with respect to the  Guaranteed
Obligations  or any part  thereof;  (e) the  enforceability  or  validity of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or
validity of any agreement  relating  thereto or with respect to any  collateral;
(f) the  application  of  payments  received  from any source to the  payment of
obligations other than the Guaranteed  Obligations,  any part thereof or amounts
which are not covered by this guaranty even though the Administrative  Agent and
the Lenders  might  lawfully  have elected to apply such payments to any part or
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or to amounts which are not covered by this
guaranty;  (g) any change in the  ownership  of any  Obligor or the  insolvency,
bankruptcy  or any  other  change in the legal  status of any  Obligor;  (h) the
change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental
act  which  does or might  impair,  delay  or in any way  affect  the  validity,
enforceability  or the payment when due of the Guaranteed  Obligations;  (i) the
failure of the Company or any  Obligor to  maintain  in full force,  validity or
effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals,
licenses or consents  required in connection with the Guaranteed  Obligations or
this  guaranty,  or to take any other  action  required in  connection  with the
performance of all  obligations  pursuant to the Guaranteed  Obligations or this
guaranty;  (j) the  existence  of any claim,  setoff or other  rights  which the
Company  may have at any time  against  any  Obligor,  or any  other  Person  in
connection herewith or an unrelated transaction;  (k) the Administrative Agent's
or any Lender's election,  in any case or proceeding instituted under chapter 11
of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  of  the  application  of  section  1111(b)(2)  of the
Bankruptcy  Code;  (l) any  borrowing,  use of cash  collateral,  or  grant of a
security interest by the Company, as debtor in possession,  under section 363 or
364 of the United States  Bankruptcy  Code; (m) the  disallowance  of all or any
portion any Lender's  claims for repayment of the Guaranteed  Debt under section
502 or 506 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; or (n) any other circumstances,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, which could constitute a defense
to a  guarantor;  all  whether  or not the  Company  shall  have had  notice  or
knowledge  of any act or  omission  referred  to in the  foregoing  clauses  (a)
through  (n) of this  paragraph.  It is  agreed  that  the  Company's  liability
hereunder  is  several  and  independent  of  any  other   guaranties  or  other
obligations at any time in effect with respect to the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any part  thereof and that the  Company's  liability  hereunder  may be enforced
regardless of the existence,  validity,  enforcement or  non-enforcement  of any
such other  guaranties or other  obligations  or any provision of any applicable
law  or  regulation  purporting  to  prohibit  payment  by  any  Obligor  of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  in the manner  agreed upon  between the Obligor and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

         10.4  Acceleration.  The Company agrees that, as between the Company on
the one hand, and the Lenders and the  Administrative  Agent, on the other hand,
the obligations of each Obligor  guaranteed under this Article X may be declared
to be forthwith  due and payable,  or may be deemed  automatically  to have been
accelerated,  as provided in Section 9.1 hereof for  purposes of this Article X,
notwithstanding  any  stay,  injunction  or  other  prohibition  (whether  in  a
bankruptcy  proceeding  affecting  such Obligor or  otherwise)  preventing  such
declaration  as against such Obligor and that, in the event of such  declaration
or automatic  acceleration,  such obligations (whether or not due and payable by
such Obligor) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes
of this Article X.

         10.5   Marshaling;   Reinstatement.   None  of  the   Lenders  nor  the
Administrative  Agent nor any Person  acting for or on behalf of the  Lenders or
the  Administrative  Agent shall have any  obligation  to marshall any assets in
favor of the  Company or  against or in payment of any or all of the  Guaranteed
Obligations. If the Company, any other Borrower or any other guarantor of all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations makes a payment or payments to any Lender
or the  Administrative  Agent, which payment or payments or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or preferential,  set aside
and/or required to be repaid to such Borrower, the Company, such other guarantor
or any other Person,  or their respective  estates,  trustees,  receivers or any
other party,  including,  without limitation,  the Company, under any bankruptcy
law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of
such payment or repayment, the part of the Guaranteed Obligations which has been
paid,  reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated  and continued in
full force and effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment,
reduction or satisfaction.

         10.6  Subrogation.  Until  the  irrevocable  payment  in  full  of  the
Obligations  and  termination  of all  commitments  which could give rise to any
Guaranteed  Obligation,  the  Company  shall have no right of  subrogation  with
respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and hereby waives any right to enforce
any remedy  which the  Administrative  Agent  and/or the  Lenders now has or may
hereafter have against the Company,  any endorser or any other  guarantor of all
or any part of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and the Company  hereby waives any
benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to
the Administrative  Agent and/or the Lenders to secure payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations  or any part  thereof or any other  liability  of any Obligor to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders.

         10.7  Termination  Date.  Subject to Section 10.5 this  guaranty  shall
continue in effect until the later of (a) the Facility Termination Date, and (b)
the date on which this  Agreement  has otherwise  expired or been  terminated in
accordance with its terms and all of the Guaranteed  Obligations  have been paid
in full in cash.


ARTICLE XI:  GENERAL PROVISIONS

         11.1 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties of
the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery of this Agreement
and the  making  of the  Loans  herein  contemplated  so long as any  principal,
accrued  interest,  fees,  or any other  amount due and  payable  under any Loan
Document is  outstanding  and unpaid (other than  contingent  reimbursement  and
indemnification  obligations) and so long as the Revolving Loan Commitments have
not been terminated.

         11.2 Governmental  Regulation.  Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary  notwithstanding,  no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to
the Company or any other  Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition
provided by any applicable statute or regulation.

        11.3 Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any
of the provisions of the Loan Documents.

        11.4 Entire  Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrowers,  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings  among the Borrowers,  the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  relating to the  subject  matter  thereof
other than the New Fee Letter.

        11.5 Several  Obligations;  Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective
obligations  of the  Lenders  hereunder  are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other Lender (except to the extent to which
the  Administrative  Agent is  authorized  to act as such).  The  failure of any
Lender to perform any of its  obligations  hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.  Any obligation of "the Borrowers"
hereunder shall be joint and several obligation of the Borrowers. This Agreement
shall not be  construed  so as to confer  any right or  benefit  upon any Person
other than the parties to this  Agreement and their  respective  successors  and
assigns.

         11.6     Expenses; Indemnification.

         (a) Expenses.  The Borrowers shall reimburse the  Administrative  Agent
         for  any  reasonable  costs  and  out-of-pocket   expenses   (including
         reasonable   attorneys'  and  paralegals'  fees  and  time  charges  of
         attorneys and paralegals for the Administrative  Agent,  Issuing Banks,
         Swing Line Bank and Alternative Currency Banks) paid or incurred by the
         Administrative  Agent in connection with the preparation,  negotiation,
         execution,  delivery,   syndication,   review,  proposed  or  completed
         amendment,  waiver  or  modification,  and  administration  of the Loan
         Documents.  The Borrowers  also agree to reimburse  the  Administrative
         Agent,  each  Alternate  Currency  Bank,  each Arranger and each of the
         Lenders for any costs and out-of-pocket  expenses (including reasonable
         attorneys'  and  paralegals'  fees and time  charges of  attorneys  and
         paralegals for the Administrative  Agent, each Alternate Currency Bank,
         each Arranger and each Lender,  which  attorneys and  paralegals may be
         employees of the  Administrative  Agent, such Alternate  Currency Bank,
         such Arranger,  or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the  Administrative
         Agent,  the Alternate  Currency  Banks,  the Arrangers or any Lender in
         connection  with the collection of the  Obligations  and enforcement of
         the  Loan  Documents.   The  Administrative  Agent  shall  provide  the
         Borrowers  with a detailed  statement of all  reimbursements  requested
         under this Section 11.6(a).

         (b)  Indemnity.  The  Borrowers  hereby  further agree to indemnify the
         Administrative Agent, the Arrangers,  the Alternate Currency Banks, the
         Issuing  Banks  and  each  and all of the  Lenders  and  each of  their
         respective  Affiliates,   and  each  of  the  Administrative   Agent's,
         Arrangers',  Alternate  Currency Bank's,  Issuing Bank's,  Lender's and
         Affiliate's directors,  officers, employees,  attorneys and agents (all
         such  persons,  "Indemnitees")  against  all losses,  claims,  damages,
         penalties,  judgments,  liabilities  and expenses  (including,  without
         limitation,  all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether
         or not such Indemnitee is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or
         incur  arising  out of or relating  to this  Agreement,  the other Loan
         Documents,   the  Spectra  Precision   Acquisition,   the  transactions
         contemplated  hereby or the direct or indirect  application or proposed
         application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder  except to the extent
         that they are determined in a final non-appealable  judgment by a court
         of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.

          (c) Waiver of Certain Claims. The Borrowers further agree to assert no
          claim  against  any of the  Indemnitees  on any  theory  of  liability
          seeking  consequential,   special,  indirect,  exemplary  or  punitive
          damages.

          (d) Survival of  Agreements.  The  obligations  and  agreements of the
          Borrowers  under this Section 11.6 shall  survive the  termination  of
          this Agreement.

         11.7 Numbers of Documents. All statements,  notices, closing documents,
and  requests  hereunder  shall be furnished  to the  Administrative  Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each
of the Lenders.

         11.8 Accounting.  Except with respect to the pricing grid  calculations
in Section 2.15 and the financial covenant  calculations in Section 7.4, both of
which shall be made in accordance  with  Agreement  Accounting  Principles as in
effect on the date hereof, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted
and all accounting  determinations  hereunder  shall be made in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as in  effect  from  time to  time,
consistently applied.

         11.9  Severability  of  Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative,  unenforceable,  or invalid in any  jurisdiction
shall,  as to that  jurisdiction,  be  inoperative,  unenforceable,  or  invalid
without  affecting  the  remaining   provisions  in  that  jurisdiction  or  the
operation,   enforceability,   or  validity  of  that  provision  in  any  other
jurisdiction,  and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         11.10 Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship  between the Borrowers
and the  Lenders and the  Administrative  Agent shall be solely that of borrower
and  lender.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any Lender  shall have any
fiduciary  responsibilities  to the  Borrowers  or the  Guarantors.  Neither the
Administrative  Agent  nor  any  Lender  undertakes  any  responsibility  to any
Borrower  or  Guarantor  to review or inform any  Borrower or  Guarantor  of any
matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers' business or operations.

         11.11   GOVERNING  LAW.  ANY  DISPUTE  BETWEEN  ANY  BORROWER  AND  THE
ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT, ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER HOLDER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT
OF, CONNECTED WITH,  RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE  RELATIONSHIP  ESTABLISHED
BETWEEN  THEM IN  CONNECTION  WITH,  THIS  AGREEMENT  OR ANY OF THE  OTHER  LOAN
DOCUMENTS, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE
RESOLVED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE  INTERNAL  LAWS  (BUT  WITHOUT  REGARD TO THE
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         11.12    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS; JURY TRIAL.

         (a) EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (b), EACH
         OF THE PARTIES  HERETO AGREES THAT ALL DISPUTES  AMONG THEM ARISING OUT

         JURISDICTION  OVER ANY  BORROWERS (2) IN ORDER TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR

         LOCATION OF THE COURT IN WHICH SUCH PERSON HAS  COMMENCED A  PROCEEDING
         DESCRIBED IN THIS SUBSECTION (b).

ARTICLE XII:  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         12.1  Appointment;  Nature of  Relationship.  BNS is  appointed  by the
Lenders  as the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  and  under  each  other  Loan
Document,  and each of the Lenders  irrevocably  authorizes  the  Administrative
Agent to act as the  contractual  representative  of such Lender with the rights
and duties  expressly  set forth  herein and in the other  Loan  Documents.  The
Administrative  Agent agrees to act as such contractual  representative upon the
express conditions contained in this Article XII. Notwithstanding the use of the
defined term "Administrative  Agent," it is expressly understood and agreed that
the Administrative  Agent shall not have any fiduciary  responsibilities  to any
Holder of Obligations  by reason of this  Agreement and that the  Administrative
Agent is merely  acting as the  representative  of the  Lenders  with only those
duties  as are  expressly  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents.  In its  capacity as the  Lenders'  contractual  representative,  the
Administrative  Agent (i) does not  assume  any  fiduciary  duties to any of the
Holders of Obligations, (ii) is a "representative" of the Holders of Obligations
within the meaning of Section 9-105 of the Uniform  Commercial Code and (iii) is
acting as an independent contractor,  the rights and duties of which are limited
to those  expressly set forth in this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents.
Each of the Lenders,  for itself and on behalf of its  Affiliates  as Holders of
Obligations,  agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative  Agent on any
agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all
of which claims each Holder of Obligations waives.

         12.2 Powers. The Administrative  Agent shall have and may exercise such
powers  under  the  Loan  Documents  as  are   specifically   delegated  to  the
Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof,  together with such powers as
are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall have no
implied  duties or fiduciary  duties to the Lenders,  or any  obligation  to the
Lenders to take any action  hereunder  or under any of the other Loan  Documents
except any action  specifically  provided by the Loan  Documents  required to be
taken by the Administrative Agent.

         12.3 General Immunity.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
directors,  officers,  agents or employees  shall be liable to the Company,  the
Lenders or any Lender for any action  taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
hereunder  or under  any  other  Loan  Document  or in  connection  herewith  or
therewith  except to the  extent  such  action or  inaction  is found in a final
judgment by a court of competent  jurisdiction to have arisen primarily from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         12.4 No  Responsibility  for Loans,  Creditworthiness,  Recitals,  Etc.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors,  officers,  agents or
employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain,  inquire into,
or verify (a) any statement,  warranty or representation made in connection with
any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder;  (b) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants or  agreements  of any obligor under any Loan  Document;
(c) the satisfaction of any condition  specified in Article V, except receipt of
items  required to be  delivered  solely to the  Administrative  Agent;  (d) the
existence  or  possible   existence   of  any  Default  or  (e)  the   validity,
effectiveness  or  genuineness  of any Loan Document or any other  instrument or
writing furnished in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible  to any  Lender for any  recitals,  statements,  representations  or
warranties  herein or in any of the other Loan Documents,  or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, legality, enforceability,  collectibility,
or  sufficiency  of this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan  Documents  or the
transactions  contemplated  thereby,  or  for  the  financial  condition  of any
guarantor  of  any  or  all  of  the  Obligations,  the  Company  or  any of its
Subsidiaries.

         12.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall
in all  cases be fully  protected  in  acting,  or in  refraining  from  acting,
hereunder  and  under  any  other  Loan  Document  in  accordance  with  written
instructions  signed by the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the event
that and to the extent that this Agreement  expressly  requires such),  and such
instructions  and any action taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall be
binding on all of the  Lenders  and on all owners of Loans and on all Holders of
Obligations.  The  Administrative  Agent shall be fully  justified in failing or
refusing to take any action  hereunder and under any other Loan Document  unless
it shall  first be  indemnified  to its  satisfaction  by the  Lenders  pro rata
against any and all  liability,  cost and expense that it may incur by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action.

         12.6  Employment of Agents and Counsel.  The  Administrative  Agent may
execute any of its duties as the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder and under any
other Loan Document by or through employees,  agents, and  attorneys-in-fact and
shall  not be  answerable  to the  Lenders,  except  as to money  or  securities
received by it or its  authorized  agents,  for the default or misconduct of any
such  agents or  attorneys-in-fact  selected  by it with  reasonable  care.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall be  entitled  to advice of counsel  concerning  the
contractual arrangement between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and all
matters pertaining to the Administrative  Agent's duties hereunder and under any
other Loan Document.

         12.7 Reliance on Documents;  Counsel. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled  to rely upon any  notice,  consent,  certificate,  affidavit,  letter,
telegram,  statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect
to legal  matters,  upon the opinion of counsel  selected by the  Administrative
Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent.

         12.8 The Administrative Agent's,  Issuing Banks', Swing Line Bank's and
Alternate  Currency Banks'  Reimbursement and  Indemnification.

          (a) The Lenders agree to reimburse  and  indemnify the  Administrative
          Agent ratably in proportion  to their  respective  Pro Rata Shares (i)
          for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
          Lenders,  in connection  with the  preparation,  execution,  delivery,
          administration  and enforcement of the Loan Documents and (ii) for any
          liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
          judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or  disbursements of any kind and
          nature  whatsoever  which may be imposed  on,  incurred by or asserted
          against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out
          of the Loan  Documents or any other  document  delivered in connection
          therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement
          of any of the terms thereof or of any such other  documents;  provided
          that no Lender shall be liable for any of the  foregoing to the extent
          any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable  judgment by a
          court of  competent  jurisdiction  to have arisen  primarily  from the
          gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.

          (b) The Lenders with a Revolving  Loan  Commitment  agree to reimburse
          and indemnify the  Administrative  Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swing
          Line Bank and the  Alternate  Currency  Banks ratably in proportion to
          their  respective  Pro  Rata  Revolving  Shares  (i) any  amounts  not
          reimbursed  by any Borrower for which the  Administrative  Agent,  the
          Issuing  Banks,  the Swing Line Bank and the Alternate  Currency Banks
          are  entitled  to   reimbursement  by  any  Borrower  under  the  Loan
          Documents,  (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative
          Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank or any Alternate Currency
          Bank on behalf of the Lenders,  in  connection  with the  preparation,
          execution,  delivery,  administration  and  enforcement  of  the  Loan
          Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
          penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
          of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by
          or asserted  against the  Administrative  Agent, any Issuing Bank, the
          Swing Line Bank or any Alternate  Currency Bank in any way relating to
          or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other  document  delivered
          in connection therewith or the transactions  contemplated  thereby, or
          the  enforcement  of any of the  terms  thereof  or of any such  other
          documents;  provided  that no Lender  shall be  liable  for any of the
          foregoing  to the  extent  any of the  foregoing  is  found in a final
          non-appealable  judgment by a court of competent  jurisdiction to have
          arisen  primarily from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of
          the Administrative  Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank, the Swing Line
          Bank or the applicable Alternate Currency Bank.

         12.9 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Revolving Loan Commitment,
Loans made by it,  Swing Line Loans made by it and  Letters of Credit  issued by
it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and
under any other Loan Document as any Lender or Issuing Bank and may exercise the
same as though it were not the  Administrative  Agent,  and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders",  "Swing Line Bank",  "Issuing Bank" or "Issuing Banks" shall,  unless
the  context  otherwise  indicates,  include  the  Administrative  Agent  in its
individual  capacity.  The  Administrative  Agent may accept deposits from, lend
money to,  and  generally  engage in any kind of  trust,  debt,  equity or other
transaction,  in addition to those  contemplated  by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document,  with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Person
is not prohibited hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         12.10 Lender Credit  Decision.  Each Lender  acknowledges  that it has,

other Loan Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently

         12.11 Successor  Administrative  Agent.  The  Administrative  Agent may

Agent. If no successor  Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted such  appointment  within thirty days

retiring  Administrative  Agent may appoint,  on behalf of the Borrowers and the
Lenders, a successor  Administrative Agent. Such successor  Administrative Agent
shall be a  commercial  bank having  capital and  retained  earnings of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor  Administrative  Agent,  such successor  Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring
Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  After any retiring Administrative
Agent's  resignation  hereunder as Administrative  Agent, the provisions of this
Article  XII shall  continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it while it was  acting as the  Administrative
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

         12.12 No Duties Imposed Upon Syndication Agent,  Documentation Agent or
Arrangers.  None of the Persons  identified on the cover page to this Agreement,
the  signature  pages to this  Agreement  or  otherwise  in this  Agreement as a

power, obligation, liability,  responsibility or duty under this Agreement other
than, (a) expressly granted  indemnification  rights and (b) if such Person is a
Lender, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing,
none  of the  Persons  identified  on the  cover  page to  this  Agreement,  the
signature  pages  to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise  in  this  Agreements  as a
"Syndication Agent", "Documentation Agent" or "Arranger" shall have or be deemed
to have any  fiduciary  duty to or fiduciary  relationship  with any Lender.  In
addition  to the  agreements  set forth in Section  12.10,  each of the  Lenders
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Persons so
identified  in deciding to enter into this  Agreement or in taking or not taking
action hereunder.

         12.13 Collateral Agent. The Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent

surveys and other documentation. All references to the "Administrative Agent" in
Article XII shall also be deemed to be references to the Collateral Agent.


ARTICLE XIII:  SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         13.1 Setoff.  In addition to, and without  limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under  applicable law, if any Default occurs and is continuing,  any
Indebtedness from any Lender to the Company or any other Borrower (including all
account balances,  whether  provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing
to such Lender,  whether or not the Obligations,  or any part hereof, shall then
be due.

         13.2 Ratable Payments.  If any Lender,  whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments  received pursuant to
Sections  4.1,  4.2 or 4.4  and  payments  expressly  hereunder  provided  to be
distributed  on other than a pro rata basis or payments made and  distributed in
accordance with Section 2.12) in a greater  proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will
hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender,  whether in connection with
setoff or  amounts  which  might be  subject  to setoff or  otherwise,  receives
collateral or other  protection  for its Obligation or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in  proportion  to the  obligations  owing to them.  In case any such payment is
disturbed by legal process, or otherwise,  appropriate further adjustments shall
be made.

       13.3 Application of Payments.  The  Administrative  Agent shall apply all
payments and prepayments in respect of any Obligations in the following order:
first,  to pay interest on and then  principal of any portion of the Loans which
the Administrative Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender for which the
Administrative  Agent  has  not  then  been  reimbursed  by such  Lender  or the
applicable  Borrower and to pay any Swing Line Loan,  Alternate Currency Loan or
Reimbursement  Obligation that has not been paid; second, to the ratable payment
of the  Obligations  then due and payable;  and third, to the ratable payment of
all other Obligations.

         13.4  Relations  Among  Lenders.   The  Lenders  are  not  partners  or
co-venturers,  and no Lender  shall be liable for the acts or  omissions  of, or
(except  as  otherwise  set forth  herein in case of the  Administrative  Agent)
authorized to act for, any other Lender.

ARTICLE XIV:  BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         14.1  Successors  and  Assigns.  The terms and  provisions  of the Loan
Documents  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the  Borrowers  and
the Lenders and their  respective  successors  and  assigns,  except that (a) no
Borrower shall have any right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan
Documents without the consent of all of the Lenders,  and any such assignment in
violation of this Section 14.1(a) shall be null and void, and (b) any assignment
by  any  Lender  must  be  made  in   compliance   with   Section  14.3  hereof.
Notwithstanding  clause (b) of this Section 14.1 or Section 14.3, (i) any Lender
may at any time, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent
(unless a Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing,  in which
case the consent of the  Administrative  Agent shall be required,  which consent
shall not  unreasonably  be  withheld),  assign all or any portion of its rights
under this  Agreement  to a Federal  Reserve Bank and (ii) any Lender which is a
fund or commingled  investment  vehicle that invests in commercial  loans in the
ordinary  course of its  business  may at any time,  without  the consent of any
Borrower or the Administrative  Agent (unless a Default or Unmatured Default has
occurred  and is  continuing,  in which case the  consent of the  Administrative
Agent shall be required,  which  consent  shall not  unreasonably  be withheld),
pledge or assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement to a trustee
or other  representative  of holders of obligations owed or securities issued by
such Lender as collateral to secure such  obligations  or  securities;  provided
that no such  assignment or pledge shall release the transferor  Lender from its
obligations  hereunder.  The  Administrative  Agent may treat each Lender as the
owner of the Loans made by such Lender  hereunder for all purposes hereof unless
and until  such  Lender  complies  with  Section  14.3  hereof in the case of an
assignment  thereof or, in the case of any other  transfer,  a written notice of
the transfer is filed with the Administrative  Agent. Any assignee or transferee
of a Loan,  Revolving Loan  Commitment,  L/C Interest or any other interest of a
lender under the Loan Documents agrees by acceptance  thereof to be bound by all
the terms and  provisions  of the Loan  Documents.  Any  request,  authority  or
consent of any  Person,  who at the time of making  such  request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of any Loan,  shall be conclusive  and binding
on any subsequent owner, transferee or assignee of such Loan.

         14.2     Participations.

         (a) Permitted  Participants;  Effect. Subject to the terms set forth in
         this  Section  14.2,  any Lender  may,  in the  ordinary  course of its
         business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one
         or  more  banks  or  other  entities   ("Participants")   participating
         interests  in any  Loan  owing  to  such  Lender,  any  Revolving  Loan
         Commitment of such Lender, any L/C Interest of such Lender or any other
         interest  of such  Lender  under  the Loan  Documents  on a pro rata or
         non-pro rata basis.  Notice of such participation to the Administrative
         Agent shall be required prior to any participation  becoming  effective
         with  respect to a  Participant  which is not a Lender or an  Affiliate
         thereof.  Upon receiving said notice,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
         record  the  participation  in the  Register  it  maintains.  Moreover,
         notwithstanding  such  recordation,  such  participation  shall  not be
         considered an assignment  under Section 14.3 of this Agreement and such
         Participant  shall not be considered a Lender. In the event of any such
         sale by a Lender of  participating  interests  to a  Participant,  such
         Lender's  obligations  under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,
         such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
         for the performance of such  obligations,  such Lender shall remain the
         owner  of all  Loans  made  by it  for  all  purposes  under  the  Loan
         Documents,  all amounts  payable by the applicable  Borrower under this
         Agreement  shall be  determined  as if such  Lender  had not sold  such
         participating   interests,   and  the   applicable   Borrower  and  the
         Administrative  Agent shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with
         such Lender in  connection  with such Lender's  rights and  obligations
         under the Loan  Documents  except that,  for purposes of Article IV and
         Section  9.2  hereof,  the  Participants  shall be entitled to the same
         rights as if they were Lenders.

         (b) Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve,
         without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,  modification or
         waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
         modification  or waiver with  respect to any Loan,  Letter of Credit or
         Revolving  Loan  Commitment in which such  Participant  has an interest
         which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate
         or fees payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to
         any such Loan or Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  postpones any date fixed
         for any  regularly-scheduled  payment of  principal  of, or interest or
         fees on, any such Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment.

         14.3     Assignments.

         (a) Permitted  Assignments.

               (i) Any Lender  (each such  assigning  Lender  under this Section
          14.3 being an "Assigning  Lender") may, in the ordinary  course of its
          business and in accordance  with applicable law, at any time assign to
          one or more banks or other entities  (other than the Company or any of
          its  Affiliates)  ("Purchasers")  all or a portion  of its  rights and
          obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  its
          Tranche A Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  its  Tranche B Revolving  Loan
          Commitment,  its Tranche C Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  its Tranche D
          Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  any  Loans  owing  to  it,  all  of  its
          participation  interests  in  existing  Letters of Credit,  Swing Line
          Loans and Alternate  Currency Loans, and its obligation to participate
          in  additional  Letters  of Credit,  Swing  Line  Loans and  Alternate
          Currency  Loans  hereunder) in accordance  with the provisions of this
          Section 14.3. Such assignment  shall be  substantially  in the form of
          Exhibit D hereto  and shall not be  permitted  hereunder  unless  such
          assignment  is either for all of such  Assigning  Lender's  rights and
          obligations  under the Loan  Documents  or,  without the prior written
          consent of the  Administrative  Agent and the Company,  involves loans
          and commitments as a consequence of which neither the Assigning Lender
          nor the Purchaser will have a Revolving Loan Commitment or Term Loans,
          as applicable,  of less than  $5,000,000;  provided that the foregoing
          restrictions  with respect to such Revolving Loan  Commitments or Term
          Loans  having a minimum  aggregate  amount  (A) shall not apply to any
          assignment between Lenders, or to an Affiliate or Approved Fund of any
          Lender,  and (B) in any  event  may be  waived  by the  Administrative
          Agent. The written consent of the Administrative  Agent, and, prior to
          the occurrence of a Default,  the Company (which consent, in each such
          case, shall not be unreasonably withheld),  shall be required prior to
          an assignment  becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is
          not a Lender or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of such Lender.

               (ii)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein,
          any  Lender  (each  such  Lender,  a  "Granting  Bank") may grant to a
          special  purpose  funding  vehicle (each such special  purpose funding
          vehicle, a "SPC"),  identified as such in writing from time to time by
          the  applicable  Granting  Bank to the  Administrative  Agent  and the
          Company,  the option to provide to the Company and the other Borrowers
          all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Bank would otherwise
          be  obligated  to make to the  applicable  Borrower  pursuant  to this
          Agreement;  provided  that  (i)  nothing  herein  shall  constitute  a
          commitment  by any SPC to make any Advance,  (ii) if an SPC elects not
          to exercise such option or otherwise  fails to provide all or any part
          of such Advance,  the  applicable  Granting Bank shall be obligated to
          make such  Advance  pursuant  to the terms  hereof.  The  making of an
          Advance  by  any  SPC  hereunder  shall  utilize  the  Revolving  Loan
          Commitment of the applicable  Granting Bank to the same extent, and as
          if, such Advance were made by such  Granting  Bank.  Each party hereto
          hereby  agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any  indemnity or other
          similar  payment  obligation  under this  Agreement (all liability for
          which shall remain with the  applicable  Granting  Bank).  All notices
          hereunder to any Granting Bank or the related SPC, and all payments in
          respect of the  Obligations  due to such  Granting Bank or the related
          SPC, shall be made to such Granting  Bank. In addition,  each Granting
          Bank shall vote as a Lender  hereunder  without  giving  effect to any
          assignment under this Section 14.3(a)(ii),  and not SPC shall have any
          vote as a Lender under this Agreement for any purpose.  In furtherance
          of the  foregoing,  each party hereto hereby  agrees (which  agreement
          shall survive the  termination of this Agreement)  that,  prior to the
          date  that is one year and one day after  the  payment  in full of all
          outstanding  commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC,
          it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting
          against,  such  SPC  any  bankruptcy,   reorganization,   arrangement,
          insolvency  or  liquidation  proceedings  under the laws of the United
          States or any State thereto. In addition,  notwithstanding anything to
          the  contrary  contained in this  Section  14.3,  any SPC may (A) with
          notice to, but without the prior  written  consent of, the Company and
          the  Administrative   Agent  and  without  paying  any  processing  or
          administrative  fee therefor,  assign all or a portion of its interest
          in any Advances to the Granting Bank or to any financial  institutions
          (consented  to  by  the  Company  and  the  Administrative   Agent  in
          accordance with the terms of Section  14.3(a)(i))  providing liquidity
          and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the
          funding or  maintenance of Advances and (B) disclose on a confidential
          basis any  non-public  information  relating  to its  Advances  to any
          rating  agency,  commercial  paper  dealer or  provider of any surety,
          guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section
          14.3(a)(ii) may not be amended without the written consent of each SPC
          affected thereby.


         (b) Effect;  Effective  Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the  Administrative
         Agent  and the  Alternate  Currency  Banks of a notice  of  assignment,
         substantially in the form attached as Appendix I to Exhibit D hereto (a
         "Notice of Assignment"),  together with any consent required by Section
         14.3(a)  hereof,  (ii)  payment of a $3,500 fee by the  assignee or the
         assignor (as agreed) to the  Administrative  Agent for processing  such
         assignment,  and (iii) the completion of the recording  requirements in
         Section 14.3(c), such assignment shall become effective on the later of
         such date when the requirements in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are met
         or the  effective  date  specified  in such Notice of  Assignment.  The
         Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to
         the effect that none of the consideration  used to make the purchase of
         the Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  Loans and L/C  Obligations  under the
         applicable  assignment  agreement  are "plan  assets" as defined  under
         ERISA and that the rights and  interests of the  Purchaser in and under
         the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.  On and after
         the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser, if not already a
         Lender,  shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and
         any other Loan Documents executed by the Lenders and shall have all the
         rights and  obligations  of a Lender under the Loan  Documents,  to the
         same  extent as if it were an  original  party  hereto,  and no further
         consent or action by any Borrower,  the Lenders, the Alternate Currency
         Banks or the  Administrative  Agent  shall be  required  to release the
         Assigning  Lender  with  respect  to the  percentage  of the  Aggregate
         Revolving Loan Commitment, Loans and Letter of Credit, Swing Line Loans
         and Alternate Currency Loan participations  assigned to such Purchaser.
         Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this
         Section 14.3(b),  the Assigning Lender, the  Administrative  Agent, the
         Alternate  Currency  Banks and the  Borrowers  shall  make  appropriate
         arrangements  so that, to the extent notes have been issued to evidence
         any of the  transferred  Loans,  replacement  notes are  issued to such
         Assigning Lender and new notes or, as appropriate,  replacement  notes,
         are  issued  to such  Purchaser,  in each  case  in  principal  amounts
         reflecting  their Revolving Loan  Commitment,  as adjusted  pursuant to
         such assignment.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  no
         Borrower  shall, at any time, be obligated to pay under Section 2.14(e)
         to any Lender that is a Purchaser,  assignee or  transferee  any sum in
         excess of the sum which such Borrower  would have been obligated to pay
         to the Lender that was the Assigning Lender, assignor or transferor had
         such assignment or transfer not been effected.

         (c) The  Register.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in this
         Agreement,  each Borrower hereby designates the  Administrative  Agent,
         and the Administrative Agent hereby accepts such designation,  to serve
         as such Borrower's  contractual  representative  solely for purposes of
         this Section 14.3(c).  In this  connection,  the  Administrative  Agent
         shall  maintain  at its address  referred to in Section  15.1 a copy of
         each  assignment  delivered  to and  accepted  by it  pursuant  to this
         Section 14.3 and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the
         names and addresses of the Lenders,  the Revolving  Loan  Commitment of
         each Lender,  the  principal  amount of and interest on the Loans owing
         to,  each  Lender  from  time to time and  whether  such  Lender  is an
         original  Lender or the  assignee  of  another  Lender  pursuant  to an
         assignment  under this Section 14.3.  The entries in the Register shall
         be conclusive and binding for all purposes,  absent manifest error, and
         the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,  the Administrative Agent and
         the  Lenders  may treat  each  Person  whose  name is  recorded  in the
         Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The
         Register  shall be  available  for  inspection  by any  Borrower or any
         Lender at any  reasonable  time and from  time to time upon  reasonable
         prior notice.

         14.4 Confidentiality. Subject to Section 14.5, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders and their  respective  representatives  shall hold all nonpublic
information  obtained  pursuant  to  the  requirements  of  this  Agreement  and
identified as such by the Company or any other Borrower in accordance  with such
Person's  customary  procedures  for handling  confidential  information of this
nature and in accordance  with safe and sound  commercial  lending or investment
practices  and in  any  event  may  make  disclosure  reasonably  required  by a
prospective  Transferee in connection  with the  contemplated  participation  or
assignment  or as required or  requested  by any  Governmental  Authority or any
securities  exchange or similar  self-regulatory  organization or representative
thereof or pursuant to a  regulatory  examination  or legal  process,  or to any
direct  or  indirect  contractual   counterparty  in  swap  agreements  or  such
contractual   counterparty's   professional  advisor.  In  no  event  shall  the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender be  obligated  or  required  to return  any
materials  furnished by the Company;  provided that each prospective  Transferee
shall be required to agree that if it does not become a participant  or assignee
it shall return all materials  furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with this Agreement.

         14.5 Dissemination of Information. Each Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any  Participant  or Purchaser  or any other Person  acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective  Transferee  any and all  information  in such  Lender's  possession
concerning  the Company and its  Subsidiaries;  provided  that prior to any such
disclosure,  such  prospective  Transferee shall agree to preserve in accordance
with Section 14.4 the confidentiality of any confidential  information described
therein.
