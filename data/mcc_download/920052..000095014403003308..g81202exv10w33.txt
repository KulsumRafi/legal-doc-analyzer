This Amended and Restated Agreement ("Agreement") between Amgen USA Inc., One
Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320 ("Amgen") and Renal Care
Group, 2100 West End Avenue, Suite 800, Nashville TN 37203 ("RCG"), sets forth
the terms and conditions for the purchase of EPOGEN(R) (Epoetin alfa) by RCG,
exclusively for the treatment of dialysis patients.

        WHEREAS, Amgen and RCG entered into Agreement #20010240 effective
        January 1, 2002, and;

        WHEREAS, the parties now wish to amend and restate Agreement #20010240
        to extend the term for an additional year, restate the terms and
        conditions to accommodate the additional year, and incorporate
        additional incentive provisions covered under Agreement #20010240;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
        covenants, representations and warranties set forth herein, the parties
        agree as follows:

1.      TERM OF AGREEMENT. The "Term" of this Agreement shall be defined as
        January 1, 2002 ("Commencement Date") through December 31, 2003
        ("Termination Date").

2.      DIALYSIS CENTER AFFILIATES. RCG must provide Amgen with a complete list
        of its dialysis center affiliates ("Affiliates") on or before the date
        this Agreement is executed by RCG. Only those Affiliates approved by
        Amgen and referenced in Appendix B hereto will be eligible to
        participate under this Agreement. Modifications to the dialysis center
        Affiliates included in Appendix B may be made pursuant to the request of
        RCG's corporate headquarters and are subject to approval and
        acknowledgment by Amgen in writing. Notification of proposed changes to
        the list of Affiliates must be provided by RCG to Amgen in writing at
        least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the proposed change.
        Amgen reserves the right to accept, reject, or immediately terminate any
        Affiliates with regard to participation in this Agreement, if Amgen
        reasonably determines that such Affiliate is not properly classified as
        a freestanding dialysis center or * or if Amgen determines such
        Affiliate is a party to another * for Epogen(R) with Amgen.

3.      OWN USE. RCG hereby certifies that EPOGEN(R) purchased hereunder shall
        be for RCG's "own use", for the exclusive treatment of dialysis
        patients.

4.      AUTHORIZED WHOLESALERS. On or before the date RCG executes this
        Agreement, RCG must provide Amgen with a complete list of its current
        wholesalers, from which RCG intends to purchase EPOGEN(R). Wholesalers
        so designated by RCG and approved by Amgen will be deemed "Authorized
        Wholesalers" for the purposes of this Agreement. A current listing of
        RCG's Authorized Wholesalers is included in Appendix C. Notification of
        proposed changes to the list of Authorized Wholesalers must be provided
        to Amgen in writing at least thirty (30) days before the effective date
        of the proposed change. Amgen reserves the right to accept, reject, or
        immediately terminate any wholesaler with regard to participation in
        this Agreement. In the event Amgen terminates any Authorized Wholesaler
        from which RCG is purchasing EPOGEN(R), Amgen will work with RCG to
        identify other possible Authorized Wholesalers from which RCG may
        purchase EPOGEN(R). In the event that RCG is unable to identify another
        Authorized Wholesaler from which RCG may purchase EPOGEN(R), and subject
        to receipt and approval of an *. RCG agrees to require all Authorized
        Wholesalers to submit product sales information directly to Amgen and to
        a third-party sales reporting organization designated by Amgen.

        *       Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
                treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange
                Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities
                and Exchange Commission.

                                              AGREEMENT NO. 20010240 (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.      QUALIFIED PURCHASES. Only EPOGEN(R) purchased under this Agreement by
        RCG through *.

6.      COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE. RCG agrees to purchase EPOGEN(R) for all of its
        dialysis use requirements for recombinant human erythropoietin. RCG may
        purchase another brand of recombinant human erythropoietin for its
        dialysis use requirements only for the time, and only to the extent,
        that Amgen has notified RCG's corporate headquarters in writing that
        Amgen cannot supply EPOGEN(R) within and for the time period reasonably
        required by RCG.

7.      CONFIDENTIALITY. Both Amgen and RCG agree that this Agreement represents
        and contains confidential information which shall not be disclosed to
        any third party, or otherwise made public, without prior written
        authorization of the other party, except where such disclosure is
        contemplated hereunder or required by law, and then only upon prior
        written notification to the other party.

8.      DISCOUNTS. RCG may qualify for discounts and incentives in accordance
        with the schedules and terms set forth in Appendix A. Discounts in
        arrears will be paid in the form of a check payable to RCG's corporate
        headquarters. Discounts in arrears will be calculated in accordance with
        Amgen's discount calculation policies based on * using the * in effect
        as of the date of purchase as the calculation price, except as otherwise
        provided hereunder. Upon vesting of all earned discounts, Amgen will use
        its best efforts to make such discounts available within * after receipt
        by Amgen of data, in a form reasonably acceptable to Amgen, detailing
        all * during the applicable period. Discount amounts, as calculated by
        Amgen, must * for the applicable period to qualify. Subject to the
        section entitled "Breach of Agreement", in the event that Amgen is
        notified in writing that RCG and/or any Affiliates are acquired by
        another entity or a change of control otherwise occurs with respect to
        RCG or an Affiliate, any discounts which may have been earned hereunder
        shall be paid in the form of a check payable to RCG's or the Affiliate's
        corporate headquarters subject to the conditions described herein. If
        any Affiliates are added to or deleted from this Agreement during any of
        the periods used for comparison, for any of the discounts paid in
        arrears contained herein, Amgen reserves the right in its sole and
        reasonable discretion to appropriately adjust RCG's discounts for the
        relevant periods, by including or excluding any purchases made by those
        Affiliates during any of those periods.

9.      TREATMENT OF DISCOUNTS. RCG agrees that it will properly disclose and
        account for any discount or other reduction in price earned hereunder,
        in whatever form, (i.e. pricing, discount, or incentive) in a way that
        complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and
        regulations, including without limitation, Section 1128B(b) of the
        Social Security Act and its implementing regulations. Section 1128B(b)
        requires that a provider of services will properly disclose and
        appropriately reflect the value of any discount or other reduction in
        price earned in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider under
        a federal health care program, as that term is defined in Section
        1128B(f). RCG also agrees that it will (a) claim the benefit of such
        discount received, in whatever form, in the fiscal year in which such
        discount was earned or the year after, (b) fully and accurately report
        the value of such discount in any cost reports filed under Title XVIII
        or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, or a state health care program,
        and (c) provide, upon request by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
        Services or a state agency or any other federally funded state health
        care program, the information furnished by Amgen concerning the amount
        or value of such discount. RCG's corporate headquarters agrees that it
        will advise all Affiliates, in writing, of any discount received by
        RCG's corporate headquarters hereunder with respect to purchases made by
        such Affiliates and that said Affiliates will account for any such
        discount in accordance with the above stated requirements.




        *       Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
                treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange
                Act of 1934 and has been filed separately with the Securities
                and Exchange Commission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.     DATA COLLECTION. RCG agrees that all data to be provided to Amgen
        pursuant to this Agreement, shall be in a form that does not disclose
        the identity or name of any patient or other patient-identifying
        information such as address, telephone number, or social security
        number. RCG acknowledges that the data to be supplied to Amgen pursuant
        to this Agreement shall be used to support verification of the discounts
        and incentives referenced herein, as well as for Amgen-sponsored
        research concerning the role of EPOGEN(R) in improving treatment
        outcomes and quality of life of dialysis patients. RCG shall
        consistently use a unique alpha-numeric code (which shall not be the
        same as the patient's social security number) as a "case identifier" to
        track the care rendered to each individual patient over time, and such
        case identifier shall be included in the data provided to Amgen. The key
        or list matching patient identities to their unique case identifiers
        shall not be provided to Amgen personnel. In furtherance of Amgen
        research, RCG may agree from time to time to use its key to update the
        patient care data by linking it with information concerning health
        outcomes, quality of life, and other pertinent data that may become
        available to Amgen from other sources. Any such linking of data sources
        shall not provide the identity of any patient to Amgen. Amgen agrees
        that it will maintain data supplied under this Agreement in confidence
        and that it will not use such data to identify or contact any patient.
        No reports by Amgen concerning analyses of the data or the results of
        such research shall disclose the identity of any patient.

11.     BREACH OF AGREEMENT. If either party materially breaches this Agreement,
        then the other party may terminate this Agreement for breach upon thirty
        (30) days' advance written notice. In addition, in the event that RCG
        materially breaches any provision of this Agreement, Amgen shall have no
        obligation to continue to offer the terms described herein or pay any
        further discounts to RCG.

12.     GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
        of California and the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the
        California courts, both state and federal.

        Agreement: (a) has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by it,
        (b) constitutes a valid, legal, and binding agreement enforceable
        against it in accordance with the terms contained herein, and (c) does
        not conflict with or violate any of its other contractual obligations,
        expressed or implied, to which it is a party or by which it may be
        bound. The party executing this Agreement on behalf of RCG specifically
        warrants and represents to Amgen that he is authorized to execute this
        Agreement on behalf of and has the power to bind RCG and the Affiliates
        to the terms set forth in this Agreement. The party executing this
        Agreement on behalf of Amgen specifically warrants and represents to RCG
        that he is authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of and has the

14.     NOTICES. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
        hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made when
        delivered in person or when sent to the other party by first class mail,
        nationally recognized overnight delivery service or other means of
        written communication at the respective party's current address or at
        such other address as the party shall have furnished to the other in
        accordance with this provision.

15.     COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH CARE PRICING AND PATIENT PRIVACY LEGISLATION AND
        STATUTES. (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
        at any time following the enactment of any federal, state, or local law
        or regulation that in any manner reforms, modifies, alters, restricts,
        or otherwise adversely affects the pricing of or reimbursement available
        for EPOGEN(R), Amgen may, in its sole discretion, upon thirty (30) days'
        notice (i) terminate this Agreement, or (ii) exclude any Affiliates from
        participating in this Agreement unless such Affiliate(s) certifies in
        writing that they are, or will be, exempt from the provisions
        thereunder. Additionally, in order to assure compliance with any
        existing federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance, Amgen
        reserves the right to exclude any Affiliates from the pricing, discount,
        and incentive provisions of this Agreement if, in the opinion of Amgen's
        legal counsel such exclusion is necessary to assure such compliance.

        (b)     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, at
                any time following the enactment of any federal, state, or local
                law or regulation relating to patient privacy of medical records

                otherwise affects any of the data received or to be received in
                connection with any of the incentives


AGREEMENT NO. 20010240                                              Ver. 7/25/02

        contemplated under this Agreement, either party may, in its discretion,
        upon thirty (30) days' notice, seek to modify this Agreement with
        respect to the affected incentive. RCG and Amgen shall meet and in good
        faith seek to mutually agree to modify this Agreement to accommodate any
        such change in law or regulation, with the intent to, if possible,
        retain the essential * structure of the affected incentive. If the

16.     FORCE MAJEURE. Neither party will be liable for delays in performance or
        nonperformance of this Agreement or any covenant contained herein if
        such delay or nonperformance is a result of Acts of God, civil or
        military authority, civil disobedience, epidemics, terrorism, war,
        failure of carriers to furnish transportation, strike, lockout or other
        labor disturbances, inability to obtain material or equipment, or any
        other cause of like or different nature beyond the control of such

        of each party, except as otherwise provided hereunder. Neither party may
        assign this Agreement to a third party without the prior written consent
        of the other party. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
        counterparts, each of which is deemed to be an original but all of which
        taken together constitute one and the same agreement.

18.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding
        between the parties and supersedes all prior written or oral proposals,
        agreements, or commitments pertaining to the subject matter herein.
