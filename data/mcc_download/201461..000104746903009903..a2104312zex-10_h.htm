payable in equal semimonthly payments, the sum of Eight Hundred Fifty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Eleven Dollars ($853,811) during the period from the Start Date through February&nbsp;28, 2003. On
March&nbsp;1, 2003, the Annual Base Compensation will increase by two percent (2%) to Eight Hundred Seventy Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty Seven Dollars ($870,887). Commencing in 2004, on each
March&nbsp;1 during the term hereof, the then Annual Base Compensation shall be increased by a minimum of six percent (6%). Goldsmith will elect to defer receipt of any Annual Base Compensation over
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) which would not be currently deductible by the Employer under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") under a deferred
compensation plan or arrangement of the Employer or Parent Corporation; provided that Goldsmith may not elect to receive any such payment in any year before it may be deducted by the Employer under

Planning Committee, in each case as determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Parent Corporation (or, in the absence of a Compensation, Nominating and Governance
Committee, the Board of Directors or another committee of directors designated by the Board of Directors as responsible for matters relating to executive compensation). The aggregate amount of annual
bonus or incentive compensation (the "Annual Bonus") paid to Goldsmith pursuant to all such bonus plans for any year (including the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 and the fiscal year
during which his employment is terminated) shall not be less than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of his Annual Base Compensation as of December&nbsp;31 of the year for which the bonus is

plan goals are achieved. In determining the Annual Bonus payable to Goldsmith for any year in which he was not employed by Employer for the entire year, the Annual Bonus for the portion of such fiscal
year preceding the termination of his employment shall be an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;the amount which the Annual Bonus would have been had the plan goals achieved through the month ending
immediately following the date of termination of his employment been the plan goals for the entire fiscal year, the fiscal year had ended at the end of such month and Goldsmith's Annual Base
Compensation had been the Annual Base Compensation payable to him as of the following December&nbsp;31 had his employment continued through the following December&nbsp;31, (ii)&nbsp;multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the fiscal year through the end of the month immediately following the date of termination of Goldsmith's employment and the
denominator of which is 12. Unless Goldsmith elects to defer receipt thereof, each Annual Bonus shall be paid no later than the end of the third month of the fiscal year following the fiscal year for
which the bonus is being paid; provided, however, that if the employment of Goldsmith is terminated prior to the end of the fiscal year for which the bonus is being paid, the Annual Bonus for the
partial year preceding the termination of his employment shall be paid no later than the end of the third month following the termination of his employment and any amounts payable under any
subparagraphs of Paragraph&nbsp;10 as an Annual Bonus applicable to any portion of a fiscal year of less than twelve months shall be paid no later than the end of the third month following the end

dental, accidental life and disability insurance, and he shall be entitled to all employee and fringe benefits and reimbursement of expenses and to participate in all benefit plans (including stock
option plans) as are consistent with his position and duties and those previously provided to the Chief Executive Officer of Employer; provided, however, that future stock option grants to Goldsmith
shall be at the discretion of the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Parent Corporation. Goldsmith shall also be entitled to receive a supplemental retirement benefit as set
forth in Appendix&nbsp;A to this Agreement. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Termination by Employer for Good Cause</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Employer may terminate the employment of Goldsmith for "good cause" by written
notice to Goldsmith. For purposes of this Agreement, "good cause" shall mean only (i)&nbsp;conviction of a crime directly related to his employment hereunder, (ii)&nbsp;conviction of a felony
involving moral turpitude, (iii)&nbsp;willful and gross mismanagement of the business and affairs of Employer, or (iv)&nbsp;willful and material breach of any material provision of this Agreement.
In the event the employment of Goldsmith is terminated pursuant to this subparagraph 10(a), Employer shall have no further liability to Goldsmith other than for compensation accrued through the date

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event Employer contends that it has good cause to terminate Goldsmith pursuant to clause&nbsp;(iii) or (iv)&nbsp;of the second sentence of this subparagraph 10(a), Employer
shall provide Goldsmith with written notice specifying in reasonable detail the services or matters which it contends Goldsmith has not been adequately performing, or the material provisions of this
Agreement of which Goldsmith is in violation and the acts constituting such violation, why Employer has good cause to terminate this Agreement, and what Goldsmith should do to adequately perform his
obligations hereunder. If within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of the notice Goldsmith performs the required services or modifies his performance to correct the matters complained of, Goldsmith's
breach will be deemed cured, and Goldsmith's employment shall not be terminated. However, if the nature of the service not performed by Goldsmith or the matters complained of are such that more than
thirty (30)&nbsp;days are reasonably required to perform the required service or to correct the matters complained of, then his breach will be deemed cured if he commences to perform such service or
to correct such matters within the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such performance or correction to completion. If Goldsmith does not perform the required services
or modify his performance to correct the matter complained of within the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period or the extension thereof, Employer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at the end of
the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period or extension thereof. It is understood that Goldsmith's performance hereunder shall not be deemed unsatisfactory solely on the basis of any economic performance of
Employer because this performance will depend in part on a variety of factors over which Goldsmith has little control. </FONT></P>

10(b) without good cause, Employer shall be obligated to pay to Goldsmith (which shall be in lieu of any other amounts which would be payable to Goldsmith on account of such termination pursuant to
any separation pay plan or policy of Employer) (i)&nbsp;the Annual Base Compensation and Annual Bonus he would have been paid had he remained in the employ of the Employer hereunder, and had the

credit in calculating his supplemental retirement benefit) he would have received hereunder had he remained in the employ of the Employer for such three-year period (and, if required, the

maintaining medical and health insurance (through COBRA or otherwise) for him, his spouse and dependents for such three-year period which is equivalent to that provided to him by Employer
at the time of termination of his employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing clause&nbsp;(ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, if long-term disability insurance coverage is an
employee benefit which Goldsmith would have received had he remained in the employ of Employer, Employer's obligation to provide Goldsmith with comparable long-term disability insurance
coverage for such three-year period shall be subject to Goldsmith being insurable at the effective date of termination of his employment. Goldsmith shall have no duty to mitigate damages,
and Employer shall have no right to offset any compensation paid to Goldsmith for services rendered as an employee of a third party or independent contractor after the termination of his employment
against any amounts which are payable under this Agreement or the Amended Employment Agreement. </FONT></P>

is any material reduction in his Annual Base Compensation, or (iii)&nbsp;the Employer requires him to be based at any office other than the corporate headquarters or moves the corporate headquarters
to any location which is more than 35 miles from the location where it was based immediately prior thereto, such termination by Goldsmith shall for purposes of this Agreement be treated in the same

illness which shall exist or may reasonably be anticipated to exist for a period of twelve (12)&nbsp;consecutive months or for an aggregate of twelve (12)&nbsp;months during any
twenty-four (24)&nbsp;month period. In the event the employment of Goldsmith is terminated by Employer pursuant to this subparagraph 10(c) because of injury or physical or mental

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsmith's
accrued annual supplemental retirement benefit shall be paid in equal monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month following his termination
of employment with the Employer for any reason other than his death. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;If

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT by and between City National Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Russell Goldsmith (the "Executive"), dated as of the 31st day of
March, 1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued
dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the
inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and
dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control
which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these
objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS: </FONT></P>

DEFINITIONS. (a)&nbsp;The "Effective Date" shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(b)) on which a Change
of Control (as defined in Section&nbsp;2) occurs. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is
terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i)&nbsp;was at the request of a third
party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this
Agreement the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
"Change of Control Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the second anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however that
commencing on the date one year after the hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"),
unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60&nbsp;days prior to the Renewal Date
the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so extended. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHANGE

outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or (ii)&nbsp;the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not constitute
a Change of Control: (i)&nbsp;any acquisition directly from the Company, (ii)&nbsp;any acquisition by the Company, (iii)&nbsp;any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by the Company, (iv)&nbsp;any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i),

any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to

Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any
additional payments required under this Section&nbsp;9) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the
Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be
entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with
respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;9 (a), if it shall be
determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount (the "Reduced Amount") that could be paid to the Executive
such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the
Reduced Amount. </FONT></P>

Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by KPMG Peat Marwick or such other certified
public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days
of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or
auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder
(which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment,

result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up
Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its
remedies pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 (c)&nbsp;and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that
has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. </FONT></P>

Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the
Gross-Up Payment. Such
notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such
claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives
such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the
expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall: </FONT></P>

the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; </FONT></P>

however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and
hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;9 (c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its
sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct
the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with
respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up
Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. </FONT></P>
