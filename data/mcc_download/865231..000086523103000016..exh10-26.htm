<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT</P>

<P>&#9;</B><FONT SIZE=3>This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) is made and entered into by and between _______________ (&quot;Employee&quot;) and Cell Genesys, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;), effective as of the latest date set forth by the signatures of the parties hereto below (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;).</P>

<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">R E C I T A L S</P>
</U>
<P>A.&#9;It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the &quot;Board&quot;) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company.</P>

<P>B.&#9;The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.</P>

<P>C.&#9;The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon Employee's termination of employment following a Change of Control which provides the Employee with enhanced financial security and provides incentive and encouragement to the Employee to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.</P>

<P>D.&#9;Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 6 below.</P>

<DIR>
<P>The parties hereto agree as follows:</P>
</DIR>

<P>1.&#9;<U>Term of Agreement</U>.&#9;This agreement shall terminate upon the date that all obligations of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement have been satisfied.</P>

<P>2.&#9;<U>At-Will Employment</U>.&#9;The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employee's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law.  If the Employee's employment terminates for any reason, including (without limitation) any termination prior to a Change of Control, the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Agreement, or as may otherwise be available in accordance with the Company's established employee plans and practices or pursuant to other agreements with the Company.</P>


<P>3.&#9;<U>Severance Benefits</U>.</P>

<DIR>
<P>(a)&#9;<U>Termination Following a Change of Control</U>.     &#9;If the Employee's employment terminates at any time within two (2) years following a Change of Control, then, subject to Section 5, the Employee shall be entitled to receive the following severance benefits:</P>
<DIR>
<P>&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;<U>Involuntary Termination</U>.     If the Employee's employment is terminated as a result of involuntary Termination other than for Cause within two (2) years following a Change of Control, then the Employee shall receive the following severance benefits from the Company:</P>
<DIR>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(1)&#9;<U>Severance Payment</U>.&#9;A cash payment in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Employee's Annual Compensation;</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;<U>Continued Employee Benefits</U>.&#9;One hundred percent (100%) Company-paid health, dental, vision, long-term disability and life insurance coverage at the same level of coverage as was provided to such employee immediately prior to the Change of Control (the &quot;Company-Paid Coverage&quot;).  If such coverage included the Employee's dependents immediately prior to the Change of Control, such dependents shall be covered at Company expense.  Company-Paid Coverage shall continue until the earlier of (i) one year from the date of termination, or (ii) the date upon which the Employee and his dependents become covered under another employer's group health, dental, vision, long-term disability or life insurance plans that provide Employee and his dependents with comparable benefits and levels of coverage.  For purpose of Title X of the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (&quot;COBRA&quot;), the date of the &quot;qualifying event&quot; for Employee and his or her dependents shall be the date upon which the Company-Paid Coverage terminates.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;(3)&#9;<U>Option and Restricted Stock Accelerated Vesting</U>.     One Hundred percent (100%) of the unvested portion of any stock option or restricted stock held by the Employee shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested.</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;4)&#9;<U>Extension of Post-Termination Exercise of Stock Options</U>.     The stock options held by Employee shall become exercisable for a period of ten years from their original date of grant by the Company.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
<P>(b)&#9;<U>Timing of Severance Payments</U>.&#9; Any severance payment to which Employee is entitled under Section 3(a)(i)(1) shall be paid by the Company to the Employee (or to the Employee's successors in interest, pursuant to Section 7(b)) in cash and in full, not later than (30) calendar days following the Termination Date; provided, however, that Employee shall be permitted to defer fifty percent (50%) of his or her severance payment until one year following the date of his or her termination if Employee submits a written election to the Company irrevocably electing such deferral at least six months prior to the employment termination triggering the payment obligation.</P>

<P>(c)&#9;<U>Voluntary Resignation; Termination For Cause</U>.&#9; If the Employee's employment terminates by reason of the Employee's voluntary resignation (and is not an Involuntary Termination), or if the Employee is terminated for Cause, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive a severance or other benefits except for those (if any) as may then be established under the Company's then existing severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other agreements with the Company.</P>

<P>(d)&#9;<U>Disability; Death</U>.  If the Company terminates the Employee's employment as a result of the Employee's Disability, or such Employee's employment is terminated due to the death of the Employee, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those (if any) as may then be established under the Company's then existing severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other agreements with the Company.</P>

<P>(e)&#9;<U>Termination Apart from Change of Control</U>.  In the event the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason, either prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control or after the twenty-four (24)-month period following a Change of Control, then the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance and any other benefits only as may then be established under the Company's existing severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other agreements with the Company.</P>
</DIR>
<P>4.&#9;<U>Attorney Fees, Costs and Expenses</U>.  The Company shall promptly reimburse Employee, on a monthly basis, for the reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Employee in connection with any action brought by Employee to enforce his rights hereunder, regardless of the outcome of the action.</P>

<P>5.&#9;<U>Limitation on Payments</U>.  In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this Statement or otherwise payable to the Employee (i) constitute &quot;parachute payments&quot; within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;) and (ii) but for this Section 5, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the &quot;Excise Tax&quot;), then the Employee's severance benefits hereunder Section 3 shall be either </P>

<DIR>

<P>(a)&#9;delivered in full, or</P>

<P>(b)&#9;delivered as to such lesser extent which would result  in no portion of such severance benefits being subject to the Excise Tax,</P>

</DIR>


<P>whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Employee on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  Unless the Company and the Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5 shall be made in writing in good faith by the accounting firm serving as the Company's independent public accountants immediately prior to the Change of Control (the &quot;Accountants&quot;).  In the event of a reduction in benefits hereunder, the Employee shall be given the choice of which benefits to reduce.  For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section.  The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5.</P>
