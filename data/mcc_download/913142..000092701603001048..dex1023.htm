COLOR="#000000">Cable Design Technologies Corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;) considers the maintenance of a sound management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. In this
connection, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a change in control may exist from time to time, and that this possibility, and the uncertainty and questions it may raise among management and employees, may result in the departure or
distraction of management and other personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the
Company&#146;s management and other key employees, including yourself, to their assigned duties without the distraction which may arise from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. </FONT></P><P
