DAYS, THE TERMINATED VP IS ENTITLED TO USE OF THE COMPANY AUTOMOBILE (OR PAYMENT
OF AN AUTOMOBILE ALLOWANCE) OR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN AUTOMOBILE EXPENSES, AS
THE CASE MAY BE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURE AND TYPE OF AUTOMOBILE PERK THAT
THE VP HAD IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION. IF THE TERMINATED VP OBTAINS
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT DURING HIS/HER SEVERANCE PERIOD, THEN THE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS
WILL BE TERMINATED EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE THAT HE/SHE BEGINS NEW EMPLOYMENT.

"CHANGE-IN-CONTROL" AND "CAUSE" SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS ASSIGNED THERETO IN THE
COMPANY'S CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN.

AS A CONDITION TO RECEIVING THE AFOREMENTIONED SEVERANCE PAYMENT AND BENEFITS,
THE ELIGIBLE TERMINATED VP MUST SIGN AND DELIVER TO THE COMPANY THE COMPANY'S
FORM OF GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS, NON-COMPETE, NON-HIRE AND NON-DISPARAGEMENT
AGREEMENT.

THIS AMENDED SEVERANCE POLICY SUPERCEDES ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY
AND A VP THAT PROVIDES FOR LESSER BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPE OF
TERMINATION COVERED HEREBY IN EFFECT ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT OR
THEREAFTER.
