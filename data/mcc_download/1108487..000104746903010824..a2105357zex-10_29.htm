SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale of Notes and Warrants.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UbiquiTel agrees to sell to the Purchasers Series&nbsp;B Notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000 and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Companies contained herein or made pursuant
hereto, each Purchaser severally, but not jointly, agrees, subject to Sections 1.4 and 1.5 hereof, to purchase from UbiquiTel on the Closing Date, a Series&nbsp;B Note or Series&nbsp;B Notes in
the principal amount listed opposite such Purchaser's name in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;I</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto. Parent agrees to sell to the Purchasers Warrants to
purchase 11,250,000 Shares and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Companies contained herein or made pursuant hereto, each
Purchaser severally, but not jointly, agrees, subject to Sections 1.4 and 1.5 hereof, to purchase from Parent on the Closing Date Warrants to purchase such number of Shares as is set forth opposite
such Purchaser's name in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;I</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The aggregate purchase price to be paid to UbiquiTel by the Purchasers for such Series&nbsp;B Notes and

hereto ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Purchase Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). If one or more Purchasers default in their
obligation to purchase Series&nbsp;B Notes on the Closing Date, and, as a result UbiquiTel has insufficient proceeds to fund the Exchange Offer or UbiquiTel elects not to consummate the Exchange
Offer for any reason whatsoever, UbiquiTel and Parent may in their sole discretion decline to sell any Series&nbsp;B Notes or Warrants to the Purchasers and may terminate this Purchase Agreement
without penalty or further obligation to the Purchasers, provided, however, that such termination shall not
relieve the defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers of any liability that they may otherwise have to UbiquiTel and Parent by reason of such default. </FONT></P>

Agreement. Each Series&nbsp;B Note will be substantially in the form set forth as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto. The Company and each Purchaser agree that
the information set forth on the face of the form of such Series&nbsp;B Note with respect to the issue price (which represents the price at which the Series&nbsp;B Note would have been issued if
it had been issued separate and apart from the Warrants), original issue discount and yield to maturity is true and correct. Interest on the Series&nbsp;B Notes shall accrue from the Closing Date
and shall be payable semi-annually, in arrears, on the fifteenth day of April and October of each year, commencing October&nbsp;15, 2005, at the interest rates and in the manner
specified herein and in the form of Series&nbsp;B Note. As used herein, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Warrants</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" means warrants to purchase in the aggregate up to 11,250,000 shares

hereto or in any Authorized Denomination as agreed to by each Purchaser, and Parent will deliver a Warrant registered in the name of

required to fund the Exchange Offer (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exchange Offer Funding Amount</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") at the Closing is less than $11,250,000, the Purchase Price for each
Purchaser, for the purchase of Series&nbsp;B Notes and Warrants, shall be reduced to an amount determined by multiplying the amount of such Purchase Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Exchange Offer Funding Amount and the denominator of which is 11,250,000, in which case the amount of Series&nbsp;B Notes and the number of shares subject to purchase pursuant to the Warrant to
be issued at the Closing shall be adjusted accordingly. Such reduced Purchase Price shall be the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Adjusted Purchase Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>". At the Closing, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;I</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
shall be amended to reflect the Adjusted Purchase Price, amount of Series&nbsp;B Notes, and number of Shares to be issued pursuant

initially deposited into escrow and the Adjusted Purchase Price disbursed to the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2 shall continue to be held in escrow as part of the Escrow Funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the period following the Closing and until the Termination Date, if UbiquiTel purchases Subordinated Notes in exchange for Senior Discount Notes and/or cash in
transactions which are not part of the Exchange Offer, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum, the remaining Escrow Funds shall be used by
UbiquiTel to purchase Subordinated Notes, in which case, to the extent so used, the Companies shall issue additional Series&nbsp;B Notes and Warrants (in principal amount and number of shares
subject to purchase thereunder, respectively, corresponding to the amount so used from the Escrow Fund) to each Purchaser in the proportionate amount to which such Purchaser is entitled. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of the Termination Date, if and to the extent any Escrow Funds have not been disbursed to purchase Subordinated Notes hereunder pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1,
each Purchaser shall have the option, exercisable by notice to UbiquiTel prior to the Termination Date, to purchase additional Series&nbsp;B Notes and Warrants in any amount up to such Purchasers'
proportionate share of such undisbursed Escrow Funds. For each Purchaser who exercises such option, the Companies shall issue Series&nbsp;B Notes and Warrants (in principal amount and number of
shares subject to purchase thereunder, respectively, corresponding to the amount subject to the options exercised) to such Purchaser in an amount equal to the amount specified by such Purchaser in
such notice, and shall disburse to such Purchaser any amounts (including interest) remaining in the Escrow Fund to which such Purchaser is entitled. The Companies shall disburse to each Purchaser who
does not exercise such option such amounts (including interest) remaining in the Escrow Fund to which such Purchaser is entitled. The Series&nbsp;B Notes and Warrants purchased pursuant this
Section&nbsp;1.5(b) shall have a maximum aggregate Purchase Price of $2,000,000, and if Purchasers exercise their options hereunder in an amount that exceeds $2,000,000, such options shall be
proportionately reduced. </FONT></P>

fines, damages, judgments, losses, suits, expenses, legal or administrative proceedings, interest, costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees)
(collectively </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>"Losses"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) suffered by such Purchaser arising out of or by reason of (i)&nbsp;the Company's breach of any of the representations,

Warrants or Shares against the Company or the Purchasers (excluding proceedings relating to the income tax treatment of the Series&nbsp;B Notes, Warrants and Shares) by any governmental authority or
other Person, except to the extent that the same arise out of or are due to the negligence or willful misconduct of a Purchaser. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, or of the threat of any action, or of any claim or threatened claim (collectively </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>"Claim"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) against such
indemnified party which is subject to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party shall immediately notify the Company in

such indemnified party only if and to the extent the Company is prejudiced by such failure. Upon receiving Notice from an indemnified party of a Claim, the Company shall be entitled to assume and
undertake the defense against such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the Company assumes and undertakes such defense, it shall not be liable to such indemnified
party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Claim. If the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to
conflict with the interests of the Company, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of
such action, at the Company's expense. The indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the Company in connection with any negotiation or defense of any Claim and shall furnish to the Company all
information reasonably available to the indemnified party that relates to such Claim. The Company shall keep the indemnified party apprised at all times as is reasonably practicable as to the status
of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. Either party may settle any Claim provided (i)&nbsp;the Claim seeks only monetary damages as relief, and not injunctive relief,
and (ii)&nbsp;the release contains a release of both parties from any further liability with respect to such Claim. </FONT></P>
