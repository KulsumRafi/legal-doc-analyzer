     The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

          1. Car allowance up to $650 per month.

          2. Earn out per annum to equal 2% of excess net (prior to taxes) based
          upon mutually agreed target with the Board of Directors.

          3. Stock options per the executive plan to equal 100,000 common
          shares. Normal executive compensation plan vesting policy will apply."

          The Addendum to Section 3.2, Incentive Compensation shall be deleted
in its entirety and replaced as follows:

          "In addition the following will provided as additional compensation:
          1. Car allowance up to $650 per month.

          2. Earn out per annum to equal 2% of excess net (prior to taxes) based

     2. On and after the effectiveness of this Amendment, each reference in the
Employment Agreement to "this Agreement," "hereunder," "herein," or words of
like import referring to the Employment Agreement shall mean and be a reference
to Employment Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

     3. Except as set forth above, the provisions of the Employment Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect as originally stated therein.

     4. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument.
