                       DIRECTOR COMPENSATION DEFERRAL PLAN
                       -----------------------------------

                 Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 1990

                           ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE
                           -------------------------

     Minnesota Power & Light Company,  sometimes known as Minnesota Power,  (the
"Company")  established,  effective  as of June 1982, a plan for the deferral of
director's fees in order to provide certain members of the Board of Directors of
the Company the opportunity to defer payment of certain Director's compensation.
The Company  hereby  amends said plan by adopting the Minnesota  Power  Director
Compensation Deferral Plan, amended and restated effective as of January 1, 1990
(the "Plan").  It is intended  that this Plan be exempt from the  participation,
vesting,  funding,  and  fiduciary  requirements  of  Title  1 of  the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.


                                   SECTION 2
                                   ---------
                         ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION
                         -----------------------------

     A Director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company is eligible
to participate in the Plan.

                                   SECTION 3
                                   ---------
                                   DEFERRALS
                                   ---------

3.1 Permitted Deferrals.
    -------------------

     Any  Director of the Company  may, by making a Deferral  Election  prior to
December  31 of any  year,  defer  all or part of his or her  compensation  as a
Director  payable by the Company in cash during the ensuing year. A new Director
who did not sit on the Board as of December 1 of the preceding year may, as soon
as he or she is elected to the Board,  make a Deferral  Election with respect to
cash compensation expected to be received in the current year. Compensation paid
in stock and any expense  reimbursement or travel allowance may not be deferred.
If less  than  all of a  Director's  anticipated  annual  cash  compensation  is
deferred,  the amount to be deferred shall be in increments of 10% of the amount
anticipated to be available for deferral.

     An election shall be effective only if it is timely filed with and accepted
by the Company, and if all the terms and conditions of the Plan are satisfied in
full.  If a Deferral  Election  Form is not returned by December 31 of any year,
the  Director  shall be deemed to have  irrevocably  elected to continue for the
ensuing year the deferral  elections  made on the last  Deferral  Election  Form
turned in and accepted by the Company for a preceding year.


3.2 Deferral Election Form.
    ----------------------

     Deferral  Elections  shall be made by duly  completing a Deferral  Election
Form provided by the Company. This form shall specify the benefit payment option
elected by the Director from the following


                                       2

<PAGE>


options allowed under this Plan: it shall permit deferral for a stated number of
years,  deferral until  retirement from active service on the Board, or deferral
until a  certain  age is  reached,  provided  that in no event  may  payment  of
benefits commence later than age 70 1/2.

3.3 Election to Defer Irrevocable.
    -----------------------------

     Except as otherwise  expressly provided in this Plan, a Director's election
to defer any  amounts  pursuant to the Plan shall be  irrevocable  when made and
accepted by the Company and shall not be subject to amendment or modification in
any manner whatsoever thereafter.



                                   SECTION 4
                                   ---------
                                DEFERRAL ACCOUNT
                                ----------------

4.1 Establishment of Deferral Accounts.
    ----------------------------------

     The Company shall  establish a Deferral  Account for each Director making a
Deferral  Election.  All such Deferral  Accounts  shall be utilized  solely as a
means for the  measurement  and  determination  of the  benefits to be paid to a
Director  pursuant to the Plan.  Deferral Accounts shall not be funded and shall
neither  constitute  nor be treated as a trust fund or any  interest in specific
assets or properties of the Company.

4.2 Crediting of Deferral Accounts.
    ------------------------------

     Each  Deferral  Account  will be credited  with any  amounts  deferred by a
Director pursuant to this Plan as such amounts are earned.  The Company shall at
the appropriate time deduct from all compensation  paid or deferred any federal,
state or local tax required

                                       3
<PAGE>

by law to be  withheld,  including  any  required  deduction  of FICA  taxes  on
compensation  earned  during  the  current  year  even  though  receipt  of such
compensation is in part deferred until a future year.  Each January,  before any
distribution  of Benefits,  each  Deferral  Account shall also be credited at an
annual  rate of  return  equal to the  overall  percentage   return  on  capital
(long-term  debt,  preferred  stock,  and common  equity) of the Company for the
calendar  year.  This  return  shall be  calculated  by dividing  the  Company's
"Consolidated  Income Before Interest  Charges" by  consolidated  capitalization
which shall include notes payable.  A sample  calculation is attached  hereto as
Exhibit A. With  respect to amounts in an account  for part of a year,  interest
shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year with 12 months of 30 days.

4.3 Statement of Accounts.
    ---------------------

     A Statement of Account in such form as the Company deems desirable  setting
forth the balance to the credit each  Director  in his or her  Deferral  Account
shall be provided to each participating Director at least annually.

4.4 Contractual Obligation.
    ----------------------

     It is intended  that the Company is under a  contractual obligation to make
payments  to  Directors  from the  general  funds and assets of  the  Company in
accordance  with the terms and conditions of the Plan.  Payments will reduce the
balance shown on a Director's Deferral Account.  A Director shall have no rights
to such payments, other than as a general, unsecured creditor of the Company.

                                   SECTION 5
                                   ---------
                              PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
                              -------------------

5.1 Form of Payment of Benefits.
    ---------------------------

     The amount held in the Deferral Account pursuant to each Deferral  Election
shall be paid in accordance with such Deferral  Election.  Such Benefits will be
paid either in a lump sum or in equal annual  installments over a term of two to
ten  years.  Benefits  shall be paid each  January,  beginning  with  the  first
January that all  requirements  and conditions for payment under the Plan and on
the Deferral  Election Form shall have been satisfied  (i.e. stated age has been
reached, stated period of years has elapsed, or termination of membership on the
Board has occurred).

5.2 Recipients of Payments: Designation of Beneficiary.
    --------------------------------------------------

     All payments of Benefits to be made by the Company  under the Plan shall be
made to the  participating  Director,  if living.  Except as otherwise  provided
herein,  in the event of a  Director's  death prior to the receipt of any or all
Benefit payments  hereunder,  all subsequent  payments to be made under the Plan
shall  be  made to the  Beneficiary  designated  by the  Director,  and,  unless
otherwise specified in the Director's  Beneficiary  designation,  in the event a
Beneficiary dies before receiving all payments due to such Beneficiary  pursuant
to this  Plan,  the then  remaining  amounts  shall be paid in a lump sum to the
legal representatives of the Beneficiary's estate.

                                       5

<PAGE>


     The participating Director shall designate a Beneficiary,  or during his or
her  lifetime  change  such  designation,  by  filing a  written  notice of such
designation  with  the  Company  in such  form  and  subject to  such  rules and
regulations as the Company may prescribe. If no Beneficiary designation shall be
in effect at the time when any  benefits  payable  under this Plan shall  become
due,  the  remaining  amounts  shall  be  paid  in  a  lump  sum  to  the  legal
representative of the Director's estate.

     If the Director's  compensation  constitutes  community property,  then any
Beneficiary  designation  made by the Director  other than a designation of such
Director's   spouse  shall  not  be  effective  if  any  such   Beneficiary   or
beneficiaries  are to receive  more than fifty  percent  (50%) of the  aggregate
benefits payable hereunder, unless such spouse shall approve such designation in
writing.

     In the event a benefit is payable to a minor or person declared incompetent
or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of his or her property, the
Company may determine to pay such benefit to the guardian,  legal representative
or person having the care or custody of such minor,  incompetent or person.  The
Company may require proof of  incompetency,  minority or  guardianship as it may
deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit.  Such distribution  shall
completely  discharge  the  Company  from all  liability   with  respect to such
benefit.

5.3 Generation-Skipping Tax
    -----------------------

     Notwithstanding  any  provisions in this Plan to the contrary,  the Company
may withhold any benefits payable to a Beneficiary as a result

                                       6

<PAGE>

of the death of the Director (or the death of any Beneficiary  designated by the
Director)  until  such time as (i) the  Company is able to  determine  whether a
generation-skipping  transfer  tax,  as defined  in  Chapter 13 of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, or any substitute  provision  therefor,  is payable by the
Company;  and (ii) the Company has determined the amount of generation- skipping
transfer  tax  that is due,  including  interest  thereon.  If any  such  tax is
payable,  the Company shall reduce the benefits  otherwise  payable hereunder to
such  Beneficiary  by the amount  necessary to provide said  Beneficiary  with a
benefit  equal to the  amounts  that  would have been  payable  if the  original
benefits had been calculated on the basis of a value for the Director's Deferral
Account reduced by an amount equal to the  generation-skipping  transfer tax and
any interest  thereon that is payable as a result of the death in question.  The
Company may also withhold from distribution by further reduction of the then net
value of  benefits  calculated  in  accordance  with the  terms of the  previous
sentence  such  amounts as the Company  feels are  reasonably  necessary  to pay
additional  generation-skipping  transfer tax and interest  thereon from amounts
initially  calculated to be due. Any amounts so withheld,  and not actually paid
as a generation-skipping  transfer tax or interest thereon,  shall be payable as
soon as there is a final determination of the applicable generation-skipping tax
and interest thereon.

                                   SECTION 6
                                   ---------

                   CHANGE OF LAW AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT FORM
                   ------------------------------------------

     The  Company  may make  payments  to any  Director  or  Beneficiary  of any
benefits or deferred amounts to be paid under the Plan, in

                                       7



<PAGE>


advance of the date when otherwise due, if, based on a change in federal tax law
or  regulation,  published  rulings or  similar  announcements  by the  Internal
Revenue  Service,  decision by a court of competent  jurisdiction  involving the
Plan, a Director or a  Beneficiary,  or a closing  agreement  made under Section
7121 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 that involves the Plan, a Director or
a  Beneficiary,  it determines  that a Director or  Beneficiary  will  recognize
income  for  federal  income tax  purposes  with  respect  to  amounts  that are
otherwise  not then  payable  under the  Plan.  The  Company  may also make such
payments to any Director or  Beneficiary  in advance of the date when  otherwise
due if it shall be determined  that the Plan is subject to the  requirements  of
Parts  2 and 3 of  Subtitle  B of  Title  I of the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security  Act of 1974,  because such Plan is not  maintained  primarily  for the
purpose of providing  deferred  compensation for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees.

                                   SECTION 7
                                   ---------

                              NON-TRANSFERABILITY
                              -------------------

     In no event  shall  the  Company  make any  payment  under  the Plan to any
assignee or creditor of a Director  or a  Director's  Beneficiary.  Prior to the
time of payment hereunder, a Director or Beneficiary shall have no rights by way
of  anticipation  or otherwise  to assign or  otherwise  dispose of any interest
under the Plan nor shall such rights be assigned or  transferred by operation of
law.

                      ADMINISTRATION AND CLAIMS PROCEDURES
                      ------------------------------------

8.1 Administration.
    --------------

     This Plan shall be administered by the officers of the Company. The Company
may from time to time establish  rules for the  administration  of the Plan that
are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

8.2 Filing a Claim.
    --------------

     Any Director or Beneficiary,  or his or her authorized representative,  may
make a claim  for  benefits  due him or her  under  the Plan by making a written
request  therefor to the Company,  setting forth with  specificity the facts and
events  which  give rise to the  claim.  The  Company  shall  promptly  respond,
consistent with any legal requirements that may apply.

8.3 Expenses.
    --------

     The cost of payment from the Plan and the expense of administering the Plan
shall be borne by the Company.

8.4 Tax Withholding.
    ---------------

     The  Company  shall have the right to deduct  from all  payments to be made
under the Plan, any federal,  state or local taxes or other charges  required by
law to be withheld with respect to such payments.

                           -------------------------

     The Company expects the Plan to be permanent,  but since future  conditions
affecting  the Company  cannot be  anticipated  or  foreseen,  the Company  must
necessarily  and does hereby  reserve the right to amend,  modify, terminate  or
partially  terminate the Plan at any time and in any manner whatsoever by action
of the Board of the Company.  Any such amendment,  modification,  termination or
partial  termination of the Plan that does not  materially  increase the cost of
the Plan to the  Company,  may occur by action of the  Company  with the written
concurrence of the Chairman of the Board; provided, however, that only the Board
shall have the power to terminate or partially  terminate the Plan or change the
Plan Crediting  Rate,  which shall be changed on a prospective  basis only; and,
provided  further,  no amendment,  termination or other change in the Plan shall
reduce the amounts   credited  to a Director's  Deferral  Account on the date of
such  amendment,  termination  or other  change,  which shall be payable to such
Director or such Director's beneficiary as otherwise provided herein.

     The Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State  of  Minnesota.  The  invalidity  of any  portion of the  Plan  shall  not
invalidate the remainder hereof and said remainder shall continue in full force.
