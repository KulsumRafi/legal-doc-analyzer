ROLLOVERS OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
date. This Section shall apply to distributions made after December&nbsp;31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification
of definition of Eligible Retirement Plan. For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section&nbsp;6.8 of the Plan, an Eligible Retirement Plan
shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section&nbsp;403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section&nbsp;457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of
a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The definition of
Eligible Retirement Plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation order, as
defined in Section&nbsp;414(p) of the Code. </FONT></P>

of definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution to exclude hardship distributions. For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section&nbsp;6.8 of
the Plan, any amount that is distributed on account of hardship shall not be an Eligible Rollover Distribution and the Distributee may not elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid
directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan. </FONT></P>

of definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution to include after-tax employee contributions. For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in
Section&nbsp;6.8 of the Plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section&nbsp;408(a) or (b)&nbsp;of
the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section&nbsp;401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. </FONT></P>
