                         SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE SHARES

         2.1 Sale and Purchase of the Shares. Upon and subject to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Buyer shall purchase and accept delivery from
the Sellers, and the Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, and deliver to the
Buyer, at the Closing, all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens.

                  (a) At the Closing, the Buyer shall (i) deliver to the Sellers

("Letter of Credit"), all remaining payment to the Sellers will be via wire
transfer to the accounts of the Sellers that are designated by the Sellers in
writing at least three (3) days prior to the Closing, or if no account is
designated by a Seller, by cashier's check. The Professional Fees will be paid
to the parties listed on the Professional Fees Certificate in accordance with

                  (b) The term, conditions and procedures by which the Tangible

shall be set forth in an Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
B (the "Escrow Agreement") to be entered into between the Buyer, the Sellers,
the Company and a mutually agreed upon escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent").

         2.3 Payment of Indebtedness. At or prior to the Closing, the Company
will pay or cause the payment of all Indebtedness of the Company (out of the
Purchase Price if at the Closing) in exchange for written releases, payoff
letters and UCC-3s from each payee, as appropriate, each to be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer (collectively, the "Discharges").

         2.4 Adjustment to Purchase Price.

                  (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following Closing, the
Company shall prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and provide it to the Buyer and
the Sellers for review and comments. As soon as reasonably practical following
the Closing (but not later than May 15, 2003), one of the regional accounting
firms listed on Schedule 2.4 hereto, which Buyer and Sellers mutually agree to
jointly solicit and select immediately after Closing ("Selected Accounting
Firm"), such approval by either party not to be unreasonably withheld, shall
audit and deliver to the Shareholders' Representative and the Buyer (i) the
Closing Balance Sheet; and (ii) based on the Closing Balance Sheet, a
calculation of the dollar value of the Tangible Assets of the Company minus (A)
the total liabilities of the Company as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet,
excluding Indebtedness, and (B) $180,000 which is equal to one-half of the
remaining PTI non-compete payments and (C) one-half of the expenses incurred in

total amount of the Tax Assets and (E) any deferred tax asset arising from the
bonus to R. John Chapel, Jr. of the leased vehicle referred to on Exhibit E,
Item 19 (the "Tangible Asset Value"). The Selected Accounting Firm shall audit
the Closing Balance Sheet and shall provide an opinion whether or not the
Closing Balance Sheet has been determined in accordance with this Agreement and
GAAP and shall calculate the Tangible Asset Value in accordance with this
Agreement. The parties each agree to grant reasonable access to all records of
the Company, to each other and to the Selected Accounting Firm, for purposes of
this Section, and to follow such procedures and make such submissions to the
Selected Accounting Firm, as it may request in auditing the Closing Balance
Sheet. All documents prepared by the Selected Accounting Firm shall be provided
to the Buyer and Sellers and Buyer and Sellers may, at their option, participate
in all meetings and communications with the Selected Accounting Firm.

                  (b) The Closing Balance Sheet and the Tangible Asset Value
shall become final and binding upon the parties unless, within sixty (60) days
following delivery to the Sellers

                                       11
<PAGE>

and Buyer, either the Sellers notify the Buyer of their objection thereto or the
Buyer notifies the Sellers, which objection may only be that the Closing Balance
Sheet was not properly prepared or audited in accordance with this Section 2.4.
Any notice of objection shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for
objection. If either party so notifies the other party of their objection to the
Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Tangible Asset Value, the Sellers and the Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences and amounts. If within
thirty (30) days (the "Resolution Period") following the receipt of such notice
by the objecting party any of such differences and amounts have not been
resolved, the parties shall submit the dispute to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, or
another mutually agreed independent accounting firm selected by Buyer and
Sellers (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), for a determination resolving such
amounts and issues in dispute. The parties shall cause any amounts not in
dispute to be paid or released from escrow to Buyer or Sellers, as appropriate,
at the commencement of the Resolution Period. Buyer and Sellers each represent
and warrant that no party or its Affiliates has or has had any relationship with
the Independent Accounting Firm in any capacity including, without limitation,
as auditor, consultant or in a teaming relationship. The Independent Accounting
Firm will conduct its own review and evaluate those items or amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet relevant to the calculation of the Tangible Asset Value
and shall determine only those items still in dispute at the end of the
Resolution Period and shall determine whether such items have been prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and with GAAP. The Independent
Accounting Firm will be granted reasonable access to all records of the Seller
Parties and the parties agree to follow such procedures and make such
submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm as it may request in conducting
its review and making its determination under this Section 2.4(c). Each party
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, a reasonable
engagement letter. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall be made
within forty-five (45) days after its engagement (which engagement shall be made
no later than five (5) business days after the end of the Resolution Period), or
as soon thereafter as possible, shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to the Sellers and Buyer and shall be final, conclusive,
non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder, provided that such
determination may be reviewed, corrected or set aside in an arbitration under
Section 10.9 of this Agreement, but only if the arbitrators find that the
Independent Accounting Firm committed manifest error with respect to its
determination. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall not be
deemed an award subject to review under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other
statute. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in resolving
any differences pursuant shall be paid one-half by the Sellers and one-half by
the Buyer.

                  (c) In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
Purchase Price within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Tangible Asset Value shall be further adjusted as follows:

                           (i) If the Tangible Asset Value is greater than or
         equal to $5,000,000, the Buyer and Sellers shall instruct the Escrow
         Agent (unless the procedures in Section 2.2(b) are employed and in that
         case, the Independent Accounting Firm shall instruct the Escrow Agent)
         to pay to the Sellers, the Tangible Asset Escrow and the Buyer shall
         pay to the Sellers in cash in the proportions set forth on Schedule 2.2
         an amount equal to the difference between the Tangible Asset Value and
         $5,000,000;

<PAGE>

                           (ii) If the Tangible Asset Value is less than
         $5,000,000, but equal to or greater than $4,500,000, the Buyer and
         Sellers shall instruct the Escrow Agent (unless the procedures in
         Section 2.2(b) are employed and in that case, the Independent
         Accounting Firm shall instruct the Escrow Agent) to pay to the Buyer
         from the Tangible Asset Escrow the amount by which the Tangible Asset
         Value is less than $5,000,000 and accordingly shall instruct the Escrow
         Agent to pay any remaining balance of the Tangible Asset Escrow to the
         Sellers in cash in the proportions set forth on Schedule 2.2; and

                           (iii) If the Tangible Asset Value is less than
         $4,500,000, the Buyer and Sellers shall instruct the Escrow Agent
         (unless the procedures in Section 2.2(b) are employed and in that case,
         the Independent Accounting Firm shall instruct the Escrow Agent) to pay
         to the Buyer the entire Tangible Asset Escrow, and the Sellers, shall
         in the proportions set forth on Schedule 2.2 pay to the Buyer in cash
         an amount equal to the difference between (y) $4,500,000 and (z) the
         Tangible Asset Value.

         Disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the Seller Parties'
disclosure schedules hereto referenced by a particular Article or Section in
this Agreement shall, should the existence of the fact or item or its contents
be relevant to any other Article or Section, be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to that other Article or Section whether or not an explicit cross
reference appears. The inclusion of an item on any section of the Seller

contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each Transaction Document to
which the Seller is a party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each Seller and, assuming such agreements constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Buyer, constitute the legal, valid and binding

and general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 4.3,
which are the only jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned
or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes
such qualification necessary. The Company does not own or have the right or
obligation to acquire, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control over
any Person.

or agreement or the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties receiving
such notice. Should any of the events for which notice is provided pursuant to
this Section 6.4 require a change to any of the disclosure schedules delivered
by the Seller Parties, the Seller Parties may deliver an amendment to the
relevant schedule specifying such change. Any such amendment shall not affect
the right of the Buyer to indemnification pursuant to Section 10 hereof.

         6.5 Public Announcements. No party without the express written approval
of the other party, issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the sale of the Company or the
Shares, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with any
securities exchange. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer and the Company
and the Sellers shall consult with each other with respect to issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement
or the sale of the Company or the Shares. The Company shall not make a general
communication to its employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld and the parties agree to cooperate with each other as to
the timing, manner and content of any public announcement.

         6.6 Acquisition Proposals. After the date hereof, the Company shall not
(nor will it permit any of its Affiliates, employees or agents to), directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations
or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any
substantial part of the business and properties of the Company, or (b) except as
contemplated by this Agreement, disclose any information not customarily
disclosed to any Person concerning the business and properties of the Company,
afford to any Person access to

                                       39
<PAGE>

the properties, books or records of the Company or otherwise assist or encourage
any Person in connection with any of the activities referred to in clause (a)
above.

         6.7 Preparation of Certain Financial Statements. After the Closing,
upon the request of the Buyer and at its expense, the Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with and assist the Buyer and the Buyer's independent public
accountants ("Buyer's Accountants") in the compilation and preparation of all
financial statements and financial statement schedules of the Company (prepared
in accordance with GAAP) and reports of Wiltse & Robinson, in its capacity as
the Company's independent public accountants ("Sellers' Accountants") prior to
the Closing, as may be necessary for the Buyer to comply in a timely manner with
SEC reporting and disclosure requirements. If requested by the Buyer, the
Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer's Accountants and/or the Sellers' Accountants
all engagement letters and management representation letters, as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyer or such accountants, which shall cover such
periods from the January 1, 2000 through the Closing Date. In connection with
the foregoing, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Sellers' Accountants to cooperate with and assist the Buyer and the Buyer's
Accountants in the preparation of the financial statements contemplated by this
Section 6.7.

         6.8 Closing Period Tax Return. The Buyer shall cause Seller's
Accountant to prepare the Company's federal and state tax returns for the period
ending on the Closing Date based upon the close-the-books method and in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Company at Company's expense after the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall provide the Sellers with an opportunity to review
and comment upon such income tax returns at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
date that such returns are required to be filed (which includes any extensions
of time). In the event that there is a disagreement between Buyer and Sellers
regarding the Company's federal or state tax returns, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to resolve their differences and to execute and file
such tax returns when such returns are required to be filed. If such differences
are not resolved prior to the due date of the returns, then such tax returns
shall be executed and filed as prepared and the parties shall amend the returns
after a final resolution has been reached either through agreement of the
parties or as otherwise provided herein. In the event that such amended returns
result in a refund to the Company of an amount previously paid based upon the
returns as originally filed, such amount shall be paid to the Sellers in the
proportions set forth on Schedule 2.2. The parties shall submit any dispute with
respect to tax returns filed pursuant to this Section to the Selected Accounting
Firm, for a determination resolving such amounts and issues in dispute. The
Selected Accounting Firm will conduct its own review and evaluate those items or
amounts in dispute and shall determine whether the tax returns were prepared in
accordance with the Code. The Selected Accounting Firm will be granted
reasonable access to all records of the Seller Parties and the parties agree to
follow such procedures and make such submissions to the Selected Accounting Firm
as it may request in conducting its review and making its determination under
this Section 6.8. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Selected
Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter. The Selected Accounting Firm's
determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement
which engagement shall be made as soon as practicable, shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Sellers and Buyer and shall be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder, provided that
such determination may be reviewed, corrected or set aside in an arbitration
under Section 10.9 of this Agreement, but only if the arbitrators find that the
Selected Accounting Firm committed manifest error with respect to


                                       40
<PAGE>

its determination. The determination of the Selected Accounting Firm shall not
be deemed an award subject to review under the Federal Arbitration Act or any
other statute. The fees and expenses of the Selected Accounting Firm in
resolving any differences pursuant to this Section shall be paid one-half by the
Sellers and one-half by the Buyer.

         6.9 Professional Fees. At least five (5) days prior to Closing, the
Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a Certificate (the "Professional Fees
Certificate") certifying as to the commissions, fees and other charges and
expenses due to each of (i) Sellers' Investment Banker, (ii) Sellers'
Accountants and (iii) Sellers' Counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The total amount due to such parties as
reflected on such Certificate is referred to herein as the "Professional Fees."
The Professional Fees Certificate shall include all charges incurred to the date
of such Certificate which have not been paid and a good faith projection of all
charges through and including the Closing and shall state that the Company has
no further payment obligations to the professionals listed on such Certificate
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Professional Fees Certificate shall include wire transfer or other payment
instructions for each of the professionals listed on the Certificate.

         6.10 Continuation Pay. Buyer agrees to provide 13 weeks of continuation
pay to Patricia Freeman if her employment with the Company is terminated for any
reason by Company or Patricia Freeman.

among members of the Andrulis Family Sellers but severally with respect to R.
John Chapel, Jr.) and R. John Chapel, Jr., severally and not jointly, in
accordance with the proportions set forth on Schedule 2.2, protect, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Parties from and against any and all
Damages incurred by the Buyer Parties arising out of or resulting from:

                  (i) any Breach of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement (without
giving effect to any amendment(s) to the Seller Parties' disclosure schedules
delivered pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof), in the Schedules and Exhibits hereto,
any Transaction Document or in certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement
or any Transaction Document;

                  (ii) notwithstanding any disclosures made on any Schedules or
Exhibits attached hereto, the matter set forth on Schedule 4.12, Items 1 through
3 ("Giovanni Matter"), the matters set forth on Schedule 4.11(a), Item 2 (Form
5500 matter); provided however that (A) in connection with the Giovanni Matter,

counsel of its own selection, (B) any amounts recovered in connection with the
Giovanni Matter by the Buyer shall be paid to the Sellers in the proportions set
forth on Schedule 2.2 in immediately available funds within ten (10) days of the
Company's receipt of such amount; (C) any settlement entered into by the Company

Additional Escrow may be applied to pay any final settlement or other final
resolution of the Giovanni Matter upon direction of Sellers; and

                  (iii) any claim that the Shareholders' Representative, acting
as an agent, attorney-in-fact or in any other representative capacity of the
Andrulis Family Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any Transaction Document, lacks the authority to so act or is
acting or has acted in excess of such authority, or that any of such agreements,
or any actions taken in connection with the Closing of this Agreement, are not
binding on any Andrulis Family Seller or effective to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as they relate to such Andrulis
Family Seller.

         (b) By the Buyer Parties. The Buyer shall protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Parties from and against:

                                       45
<PAGE>

                  (i) any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from any
Breach of any of the Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, any Transaction
Document or in certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any
Transaction Document; and

                  (ii) any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from acts
or omissions of the Company occurring after the Closing Date.

         9.3 Procedures. The party claiming the indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to the party from whom the
indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying Party") of any claim whether
between the parties or brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party,
provided that failure of the Indemnified Party prompt notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The
notice from the Indemnified Parties shall specify (i) the factual basis for such
claim, and (ii) the amount of the claim. If a claim relates to an action, suit,
or proceeding filed by a third party against the Indemnified Party such notice
shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party promptly but
in any event within thirty (30) days after written notice of such action, suit,
or proceeding shall have been given to the Indemnified Party. Following receipt
of notice from the Indemnified Party of a claim (whether between the parties or
by a third party), the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days in which
to make such investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party shall deem
necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified
Party agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party and/or its authorized
representative(s) the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to
substantiate the claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
agree at or prior to the expiration of said thirty (30) day period (or any
agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, or if
the Indemnifying Party does not respond to such notice, the amount held in
escrow to secure Sellers' indemnification of Buyer shall be paid in satisfaction
of any claim payable by Sellers until that amount is exhausted (if it is) and
once the amount held in escrow is exhausted, the Indemnifying Party shall
immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full amount of the claim. If the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party are unable to agree upon the amount of
such claim, then only the amount the parties are able to agree upon shall be
released from escrow and the amount and claim in dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 10.9 hereof. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
absolute right, in its sole discretion and expense, to elect to defend, contest
or otherwise protect against any such claim with legal counsel of its own
selection, as long as such defense does not cause a Material Adverse Effect on
the continuing conduct of the Company's business. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own expense, in
the defense thereof through counsel of its own choice and shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to assert any and all crossclaims or counterclaims it
may have. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees), to at all times cooperate
in all reasonable ways with, make their relevant files and records available for
inspection and copying by, or otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the
Indemnifying Party (i) in its defense of any action for which indemnity is
sought under this Article 9 and (ii) its prosecution under the last sentence of
this Section 9.3 of any related claim, cross-complaint, counterclaim or right of
subrogation. In the event the Indemnifying Party fails to timely defend, contest
or otherwise protect against any such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,

                                       46
<PAGE>

but not the obligation, to defend, contest, assert cross-claims or counterclaims
or otherwise protect against the same at the Indemnifying Party's expense. No
claim or action subject hereto may be settled unless the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party consent thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the claims or rights of
an Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages paid by the Indemnifying Party
under this Article 9. Any indemnification obligations of Sellers shall be
satisfied from any amounts held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
prior to Buyer exercising any other remedy or action to seek recovery of amounts
payable pursuant to Seller's obligations under this Section 9.

         9.4 Limitations on Indemnification; Additional Indemnification
Provisions.

                  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, but
subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.4(a) and Section 9.4(b) below,
(i) the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers Parties, on the one hand, and
the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for claims made pursuant to this Article 9
shall be limited to an amount (the "Indemnification Cap") equal to Five Million
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,200,000), (ii) no Buyer Party shall be entitled
to make any claim pursuant to this Article 9 unless and until the aggregate
amount of Damages with respect to all such claims that may be made by the Buyer
Parties pursuant to this Article 9 exceeds $150,000 (the "Indemnification
Threshold") after which the Seller Parties shall be liable for any amounts in
excess of the Indemnification Threshold not to exceed the Indemnification Cap,
and (iii) no Seller Party shall be entitled to make any claim pursuant to this
Article 9 unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all
such claims that may be made by the Seller Parties pursuant to this Article 9
exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, after which the Buyer Parties shall be
liable for any amounts in excess of the Indemnification Threshold.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, claims relating to
matters set forth in Section 9.2(a) based on Breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.10, 4.13, and
9.2(a)(ii) shall not be subject to the Indemnification Threshold or the
Indemnification Cap.

                  (b) The remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the parties and their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered at Closing, provided,
however, that nothing herein is intended to waive or otherwise limit any claims
for Damages resulting or arising from fraudulent or willful misconduct or waive
any equitable remedies to which a party may be entitled.

                  (c) The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other
remedy based on any representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in
this Agreement or in the Exhibits or Schedules hereto will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any notice or knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right

                                       47
<PAGE>

to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon
Closing, the Company shall cease to be a Seller Party and shall cease to have
any indemnification obligations as a Seller Party hereunder and shall be treated
as a Buyer Party, and the Seller Parties shall have no rights of recourse,
whether for contribution or otherwise, against the Company for any payments such
the Seller Party make, or are obligated to make, under this Article 9 or any
other section of this Agreement.

                  (e) Upon making an indemnity payment pursuant to this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third party in
respect of the damages to which the payment related. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

                  (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party or its Affiliate has been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement the Exhibits or Schedules attached hereto, or any document executed in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event any
Damages related to a claim by Buyer are covered by insurance, Buyer agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance and
Buyer shall not be entitled to recovery from the Sellers (and shall refund
amounts received up to the amount of indemnification actually received) with
respect to such damages to the extent, and only to the extent, Buyer recovers
the insurance payment specified in the policy.

                  (g) Each party agrees to use reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Damages which form the basis of any claim hereunder.

                  (h) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all
indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for
all tax purposes and no party shall take any position inconsistent with such
characterization.

         10.2 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent
possible.

         10.3 Cooperation in Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern
the allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Sellers for
certain tax matters after the Closing Date:

                  (a) In accordance with and subject to Section 6.8, the Buyer
shall cause Seller's Accountant to prepare and Buyer shall file or cause to be
filed the Company's federal and state tax returns for the period ending on the
Closing Date. The fees and expenses for preparing such Tax Returns shall be paid
by the Company prior to Closing and Sellers shall have no obligation for any
additional fees or expenses. The Buyer shall, at Buyer's expense, prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the
Company for the tax periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall jointly and severally pay to the Buyer
within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to
such periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such
Taxes exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
included in the Closing Balance Sheet.

                  In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax
period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in
the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date shall be apportioned between the Buyer and the
Sellers using the same formulas as used to determine the Tax liability of the
Buyer and the

                                       50
<PAGE>

Sellers with respect to such periods. All determinations necessary to give
effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with
prior practice of the Company. Sellers shall not be responsible for any
corporate level Taxes of the Company before or after Closing for Taxes due for
periods after Closing.

         (b) The Buyer and the Seller Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of tax returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller Parties agree (A) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer or the Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the
other parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other parties so request, the
Buyer, the Company or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
requesting party to take possession of such books and records. The Buyer and the
Seller Parties further agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The Buyer shall provide the
Shareholders' Representative and R. John Chapel, Jr. tax returns relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date at least 30 days prior to the due date of such
tax returns for the Shareholders' Representative and R. John Chapel, Jr. to
review and recommend such changes as reasonably requested by the Shareholders'
Representative and R. John Chapel, Jr.. In the event that there is a
disagreement between Buyer and Sellers regarding the Company's federal and state
tax returns, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve their
differences and to execute and file such tax returns when such returns are
required to be filed. If such differences are not resolved prior to the due date
of the returns, then such tax returns shall be executed and filed as prepared
and the parties shall amend the returns after a final resolution has been
reached either through agreement of the parties or as otherwise provided herein.
Any dispute with respect to such tax returns shall be resolved in the manner set
forth in Section 6.8.

                  (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, shall be paid by the Buyer when due, and the Sellers will, at their
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Buyer will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

         10.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment; Failure of Certain Conditions. This
Agreement including the Exhibits and Schedules thereto, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter

                                       51
<PAGE>

hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto, by operation
of law or otherwise; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign any of its
respective rights and obligations to any Affiliate of the Buyer but no such
assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted
assignment which does not comply with the provisions of this Section 10.4 shall
be null and void ab initio.

         10.5 Parties in Interest; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, and, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

         10.6 Legal Counsel . Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and
represents that it has been represented by its own legal counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with the opportunity to
seek advice as to its legal rights from such counsel. Each party further
represents that it is being independently advised as to the tax consequences of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         10.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard
to the choice or conflict of law principles thereof.

         10.8 Shareholders' Representative.

                  (a) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, including
counterparts hereof, each Seller with the exception of R. John Chapel, Jr.,
(collectively the "Andrulis Family Sellers") the hereby irrevocably constitutes
and appoints Dr. Marilyn W. Andrulis as the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Shareholders' Representative") of such Andrulis Family
Seller with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of
such Andrulis Family Seller with respect to the performance on behalf of such
Andrulis Family Seller under the terms and provisions of this Agreement, as the
same may be from time to time amended, and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such documents, instruments,
certificates and stock powers on such Andrulis Family Seller's behalf, as the
Shareholders' Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including: (i)
to receive all payments made by the Buyer to the Andrulis Family Sellers under
this Agreement; (ii) to agree upon or compromise any matter related to the
calculation of any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 or
otherwise or other payments to be made; (iii) to act for the Andrulis Family
Sellers with respect to all indemnification matters referred to in this
Agreement, including the right to compromise on behalf of the Andrulis Family
Sellers any indemnification claim made by or against the Andrulis Family
Sellers; (iv) to terminate, amend, or waive any provision of this Agreement;
provided that any such action, if material to the rights and obligations of the
Andrulis Family Sellers in the reasonable judgment of the Shareholders'
Representative, shall be taken in the same manner with respect to all Andrulis
Family Sellers, unless otherwise agreed by each Andrulis Family Seller who is
subject to any disparate treatment of a potentially adverse nature; (v) to
employ and obtain the advice of legal counsel, accountants

                                       52
<PAGE>

and other professional advisors as the Shareholders' Representative, in his sole
discretion, deems necessary or advisable in the performance of his duties as the
Shareholders' Representative and to rely on their advice and counsel; (vi) to
incur and pay out of the Purchase Price expenses, including fees of brokers,
attorneys and accountants incurred pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and any other fees and expenses allocable or in any way relating to such
transaction or any indemnification claim, whether incurred prior or subsequent
to Closing; (vii) to retain a portion of the Purchase Price as a reserve against
the payment of expenses incurred in his capacity as Shareholders'
Representative; and (viii) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed
on behalf of the Andrulis Family Sellers which the Shareholders' Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as any of the Andrulis Family
Sellers could do if personally present and acting.

                  (b) The appointment of the Shareholders' Representative shall
be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any other
person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any decisions
and actions of the Shareholders' Representative as the acts of the Andrulis
Family Sellers in all matters referred to in this Agreement. Each of the
Andrulis Family Sellers hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Shareholders'
Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of such Shareholders'
Representative's appointment as Shareholders' Representative of such Andrulis
Family Seller. The Shareholders' Representative shall act for the Andrulis
Family Sellers on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner
the Shareholders' Representative believes to be in the best interest of the
Andrulis Family Sellers, but the Shareholders' Representative shall not be
responsible to any Andrulis Family Sellers for any loss or damage any Andrulis
Family Sellers may suffer by reason of the performance by the Shareholders'
Representative of such Shareholders' Representative's duties under this
Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from willful misconduct in the
performance of such Shareholders' Representative's duties under this Agreement.

                  (c) Each of the Andrulis Family Sellers hereby expressly
acknowledges and agrees that the Shareholders' Representative is authorized to
act on behalf of such Andrulis Family Seller notwithstanding any dispute or
disagreement among the Andrulis Family Sellers, and that any person shall be
entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the Shareholders' Representative
under this Agreement without liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of
the Andrulis Family Sellers. If the Shareholders' Representative resigns or
ceases to function in such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the
successor Shareholders' Representative shall be the person among the Andrulis
Family Sellers which held a majority of the Stock at Closing appoint; provided,
however, that if for any reason no successor has been appointed within thirty
(30) days, then any Andrulis Family Seller shall have the right to petition a
court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor Shareholders'
Representative. The Andrulis Family Sellers do hereby jointly and severally
agree to indemnify and hold the Shareholders' Representative harmless from and
against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense (including without
limitation attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the
performance of such Shareholders' Representative's duties under this Agreement
except for any such liability arising out of the willful misconduct of the
Shareholders' Representative.

                  (d) The provisions of this Section 10.8 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
under all circumstances unless prohibited by law.

         10.9 Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof
(each a "Dispute") that the parties are not able to resolve after good faith
efforts over a period of fifteen (15) days shall be settled by arbitration
conducted in Washington, D.C., or Boston, Massachusetts and administered by the
American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). Such arbitration shall be under
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA ("Rules"), except as otherwise set
forth in this Section 10.9, and judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                  (a) If any party asserts that there exists a Dispute, such
party shall select one arbitrator and the other party shall select one
arbitrator. If either party fails to make a selection, the AAA shall select one
arbitrator on behalf of such party. The two arbitrators so selected will choose
within twenty (20) days after their selection a third arbitrator (or, if they
fail to make a choice, the AAA shall choose a third arbitrator). All three
arbitrators shall be neutral arbitrators and subject to Rule 19 of the Rules.

                  (b) In making their determination, the arbitrators shall not
have the authority to modify any term or provision of this Agreement. The
decision of any two of the arbitrators shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. The arbitrators shall award the costs and expenses of the
arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, arbitrators'
fees and fees payable to the AAA, to the prevailing party as they see fit. The
arbitrators shall deliver a written and reasoned award with respect to the
dispute to each of the parties, who promptly shall act in accordance therewith.

                  (c) Pre-hearing discovery shall be limited to exchange or
production of documents and other written information. The arbitrators shall
conduct the arbitration so that a final award is made or rendered as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than 120 days after the commencement of the
arbitration nor later than twenty (20) days following the completion of the
hearing, unless either period is reduced or extended by agreement of the
parties, or by the arbitrators for cause.

                  (d) In any arbitration hereunder, all Sellers shall be deemed,
for procedural purposes, to be a single party; the other party in the
arbitration shall be deemed, for procedural purposes, to be the Buyer. Each of
the Sellers and the Buyer, if given due notice of the proceedings, shall be
bound by the award in any arbitration hereunder, whether or not he or it chooses
to participate in the arbitration.

         10.10 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be

                                       54
<PAGE>

deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

         10.12 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN

AGREEMENTS.
