     6.4 DISTRIBUTIONS

          6.4.1 Generally. All distributions required hereunder to Holders of
Allowed Claims shall be made by a Disbursing Agent pursuant to a Disbursing
Agreement, provided that no Disbursing Agreement shall be required if
Reorganized Broadband makes such distributions or if the Old Indenture Trustee
makes such distributions pursuant to Section 6.4.2. The Disbursing Agent may
designate, employ or contract with other Entities to assist in or perform the
distribution of the property to be distributed. The Disbursing Agent and such
other Entities shall serve without bond.

          6.4.2 Services of Old Indenture Trustee. The Old Indenture Trustee (or
its nominees, designees or affiliates) under the Old Notes Indenture is
designated the Disbursing Agent for purposes of effecting distributions to
Holders of Old Note Claims, subject to its acceptance of such designation. In
the event and to the extent of such acceptance (except where the context
otherwise requires), any reference in this Plan to "Disbursing Agent" shall
instead be deemed to refer to the Old Indenture Trustee (or its nominee,
designee or affiliate). In the event and to the extent that the Old Indenture
Trustee is so designated as a Disbursing Agent with respect to Old Note Claims,
(i) distributions to be made to such Old Note Claim Holders under the Plan will
be made to the Old Indenture Trustee in accordance with the applicable Old
Indenture, applicable law and the Plan, and (ii) the Old Indenture Trustee
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, in accordance with the Old Indenture,
applicable law and the Plan, deliver the distributions, excluding such property
as may be reserved by the Old Indenture Trustee to satisfy its compensation and
those costs, fees and expenses for which the Old Indenture Trustee is entitled
to an Indenture Trustee Charging Lien under such Old Indenture, the Plan or
applicable law, to each such Old Note Claim Holder, subject to the provisions of
Section 6.4.4. To secure the payment of such compensation of, and fees, costs
and disbursements incurred by the Old Indenture Trustee, if any, which is not
paid in Cash by Broadband or Reorganized Broadband pursuant to the provisions of
the Plan, the Old Indenture or applicable law, such Old Indenture Trustee shall
have and retain, to the extent provided in the Old Notes Indenture or under
applicable law, an Indenture Trustee Charging Lien for its compensation and
fees, costs and disbursements incurred, on the property to be distributed for
the benefit of the Old Note Claim Holders under the Old Notes Indenture. If the
Old Indenture Trustee does not act as the Disbursing Agent for distributions to
the Holders of the Old Note Claims arising under the Old Notes issued pursuant
to the Old Notes Indenture, then the Disbursing Agent designated for
distributions to such Holders shall disburse the distributions to such Holders,
in compliance with such direction as may be given by the Old Indenture Trustee
as may be necessary to permit such Old Indenture Trustee to retain and enforce
its Indenture Trustee Charging Lien and otherwise in accordance with applicable
law and the Plan.

          6.4.3 Distributions to be Made to Holders as of Record Dates. Only
Holders of record of Old Note Claims as of the Distribution Record Date shall be
entitled to receive the distributions provided for in Article V of the Plan. As
of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date, the transfer ledgers
in respect of the Old Notes shall be closed for purposes of making the
distributions required in accordance with the provisions of Article V.
Reorganized Broadband, Knology, the Disbursing Agents, and their respective
agents shall have no obligation to recognize any transfer of Old Notes occurring
after such date for purposes of such distributions. Reorganized Broadband,
Knology, the Disbursing Agents, and their respective agents shall recognize and,
for purposes of making such distributions under the Plan, deal only with those
Holders of record reflected on the transfer ledgers maintained by the Registrar
for the Old Notes as of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date,
provided that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit or otherwise
restrict the right of any such Holder to transfer such securities at any time.

          6.4.4 Procedures for Distribution to Holders of Old Note Claims.

               (a) On the Effective Date, Knology shall direct the New Indenture
          Trustee to issue, authenticate and deliver to Disbursing Agent
          designated for distributions to Holders of Old Note Claims
          certificates representing the New Notes and shall take all action
          necessary and appropriate to effect delivery to the Disbursing Agent
          of the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series E Preferred Stock as
          provided for under the Plan, together with counterparts of the joinder
          agreement referred to in Section 6.1.2(b). As soon as practicable
          after the Effective Date, the Disbursing Agent, in accordance with the
          Disbursing Agreement, if any, and the Plan, and subject to the
          provisions of Section 6.4.2, shall deliver such certificates to the
          Holders that have validly surrendered such Old Notes held by such
          Holders.

               (b) As a condition to receiving from the Disbursing Agent
          distributions provided for on the Distribution Date under the Plan in
          respect of the Old Notes, any Holder thereof shall be required to
          surrender its certificates or other instruments representing such
          securities, accompanied by duly executed and completed letters of
          transmittal (including such Holder's election to become, pursuant to
          the joinder agreement referred to in Section 6.1.2(b), or not to
          become, a party to the Stockholders Agreement, as amended by the
          Stockholders Agreement Amendment), to the Disbursing Agent. All other
          such instruments surrendered to the Disbursing Agent shall be
          canceled, marked "Compromised and Settled Only as Provided in the
          Joint Plan of Reorganization for Knology Broadband, Inc. and Knology,
          Inc." and delivered to Reorganized Broadband. The Disbursing Agent
          shall make such distributions only to Holders that have surrendered
          such instruments as herein provided. Except as provided in Section
          6.4.4(c), no such distribution shall be made to any such Holder that
          has not so surrendered such instruments held by it.

               (c) Unless waived by the Disbursing Agent, any Holder of an Old
          Note Claim which has been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed shall,
          in lieu of surrendering such instrument as provided in this section,
          deliver to the Disbursing

                                       21

<PAGE>

          Agent (i) evidence satisfactory to the Disbursing Agent of the loss,
          theft, mutilation or destruction of such instrument and (ii) such
          security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by Broadband,
          Knology and the Disbursing Agent to hold Reorganized Broadband,
          Knology and the Disbursing Agent harmless from any damages,
          liabilities, or costs incurred in treating such Entity as a Holder of
          such Old Note Claim. Thereafter, such Entity shall be treated as the
          Holder of such instrument for all purposes of the Plan and shall, for
          all purposes under this Plan, be deemed to have surrendered the
          instrument representing such Old Note Claim.

               (d) Any Holder of an Old Note Claim who shall not have
          surrendered or be deemed to have surrendered the certificates or other
          instruments representing such security within twenty-four (24) months
          after the Effective Date shall have its Claim based on or Interest in
          such security disallowed, shall receive no distribution on such Claim
          under this Plan and shall be forever barred from asserting any claim
          or interest the on. In such case, the Disbursing Agent shall return to
          Knology, and Knology shall retain, all certificates or other
          instruments representing the Plan Securities allocable to such
          non-surrendering Holders (excluding such certificates or other
          instruments as may be reserved by any Old Indenture Trustee pursuant
          to an Indenture Trustee Charging Lien in accordance with Section
          6.4.2). All such certificates or other instruments representing Plan
          Securities which are so returned to Knology shall be canceled.

          6.4.5 Means of Cash Payment. Cash payments made pursuant to the Plan
shall be in U.S. funds by check drawn on a domestic bank, or, at the option of
Reorganized Broadband, by wire transfer from a domestic bank; except that
payment made to foreign trade creditors holding Unsecured Claims or to foreign
governmental units holding Priority Tax Claims shall be in such funds and by
such means as are customary or as may be necessary in a particular foreign
jurisdiction.

          6.4.6 Calculation of Distribution Amounts of Securities.

               (a) No fractional shares of Series D Preferred Stock or Series E
          Preferred Stock shall be issued or distributed, but the number of
          shares of Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock to
          which any Holder of record is entitled to receive pursuant to the Plan
          shall be rounded up to the next whole share. Subject to the provisions
          of Section 6.4.6(b), New Notes will be issued only in denominations of
          $1,000.00 or an integral multiple thereof.

               (b) On the Distribution Date, or as soon thereafter as reasonably
          practicable, the Disbursing Agent for Old Note Claims shall calculate
          the aggregate principal amount of Fractional New Notes that would be
          distributed to Holders of record of Allowed Old Note Claims fulfilling
          the conditions for distributions under the Plan set forth in Sections
          6.4.4(a) and (b), absent the limitation set forth in Section 6.4.6(a)
          on the denominations of New Notes to be issued pursuant to the Plan.
          Such Disbursing Agent will from time to time notify Knology of said
          aggregate principal amount of Fractional New Notes, and

                                       22

<PAGE>

          Knology shall promptly after receiving such notice deliver to said
          Disbursing Agent Cash in said aggregate principal amount for the
          purpose of distributing to each Holder of record of Allowed Old Note
          Claims Cash in the dollar amount of the Fractional New Notes to which
          such Holder would have been entitled, absent said limitation set forth
          in Section 6.4.6(a).

          6.4.7 Delivery of Distributions . Subject to Bankruptcy Rule 9010,
distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims shall be made at the address of each
such Holder as set forth on the Chapter 11 schedules filed by Broadband with the
Bankruptcy Court, unless superseded by the address as set forth on proofs of
Claim filed by such Holders or other writings notifying Broadband of a change of
address (or at the last known address of such a Holder if no proof of Claim or
proof of Interest is filed or if Broadband has not been notified in writing of a
change of address), or in the case of Holders of Old Note Claims, may be made at
the addresses of the registered Holders contained in the records of the
Registrar as of the applicable record date, except as provided below. If any
Holder's distribution is returned as undeliverable, no further distributions to
such Holder shall be made, unless and until Reorganized Broadband or the
Disbursing Agent is notified of such Holder's then current address, at which
time all missed distributions shall be made to such Holder together with any
interest or dividends earned thereon. Amounts in respect of undeliverable
distributions made through the Disbursing Agent shall be returned to the

Bankruptcy Court abstains from exercising, or declines to exercise, jurisdiction

or related to the Case, including the matters set forth in Section 12.1 of the
Plan, this Article XII shall have no effect upon and shall not control,

authority that it is in violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, or

regulation, or order; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
require such compliance by Broadband or Reorganized Broadband, as the case may
be, where the legality or applicability of any such requirement is being
contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings by Broadband or Reorganized
Broadband, as the case may be, and, if appropriate, for which an adequate
reserve has been set aside on the books of Broadband or Reorganized Broadband,
as the case may be.
