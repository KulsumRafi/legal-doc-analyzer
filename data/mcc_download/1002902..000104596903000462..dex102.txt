Velocity Express Corporation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     THIS AGREEMENT, made effective this __ day of ___________, between Velocity
Express Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and _________, a
resident of the State of ___________.

1.        (a) The Company agrees to sell to the undersigned, and the undersigned
          agrees to purchase from the Company, _______ shares of the Company's
          Series H Preferred Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.004 per
          share (the "Shares" or "Series H Preferred") for the subscription
          price of $10.00 per Share. The rights and preferences of the Shares
          are set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Preferences and
          Rights of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in
          Appendix A attached hereto. The Company will also issue to the
          undersigned in connection with this purchase a warrant to purchase
          _______ shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Warrant"). A form
          of the Warrant is attached hereto as Appendix B. The undersigned
          acknowledges that this subscription is contingent upon acceptance in
          whole or in part by the Company. Concurrent with the delivery of this
          Agreement, the undersigned has delivered cash or a check or wire
          transfer to the Company in the amount of $__________ in payment of the
          full purchase price of the Shares.

     (b)  Company and the undersigned agree that, as set forth in Section 6
          of Certificate of Designation of Preferences and Rights of Series H
          Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company can repurchase the Series H
          Preferred Stock of the undersigned on or before April 30, 2003 by
          tendering to undersigned $__________. In the event the Company does
          not repurchase the Series H Preferred Stock, the undersigned shall be
          entitled to receive an additional warrant (the "Call Warrant") to
          purchase ________ shares of the Company's Common Stock. A form of the
          Call Warrant is attached hereto as Appendix C.

2.        The undersigned acknowledges and represents as follows:

          (a)  That the undersigned has had an opportunity to carefully review
               the Company, has had the opportunity to conduct due diligence on
               the Company, has had the opportunity to review its public filings
               with the Securities and Exchange Commission and has reviewed the
               Risk Factors, attached hereto as Appendix D, relating to the
               Company (the "Company Materials"), and all documents delivered
               therewith or reasonably requested by the undersigned;

<PAGE>

          (b)  That the undersigned is able to bear the economic risk of the
               investment in the Shares;

          (c)  That the undersigned has knowledge and experience in financial
               and business matters, that the undersigned is capable of
               evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in
               the Shares and that the undersigned is able to bear such risks.

          (d)  That the undersigned understands an investment in the Shares is
               highly speculative but believes that the investment is suitable
               for the undersigned based upon the undersigned investment
               objectives and financial needs, and has adequate means for
               providing for his, her or its current financial needs and
               personal contingencies and has no need for liquidity of
               investment with respect to the Shares;

          (e)  That the undersigned has been given access to full and complete
               information regarding the Company (including the opportunity to
               meet with Company officers and review such documents as the
               undersigned may have requested in writing) and has utilized such
               access to the undersigned satisfaction for the purpose of
               obtaining information in addition to, or verifying information
               included in, the Company Materials;

          (f)  That the undersigned recognizes that the Shares, are an
               investment, involve a high degree of risk, including, but not
               limited to, the risks described in the Company Materials; and

          (g)  That the undersigned realizes that (i) the purchase of Shares is
               a long-term investment; (ii) the purchasers of the Shares must
               bear the economic risk of investment for an indefinite period of
               time because the Shares have not been registered under the
               Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and, therefore,
               cannot be sold unless they are subsequently registered under the
               Act, and specifically Regulation D of the Act, or an exemption
               from such registration is available; and (iii) the
               transferability of the Shares is restricted, and (A) requires the
               written consent of the Company, (B) requires conformity with the
               restrictions contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, and (C) will
               be further restricted by a legend placed on the certificate(s)
               representing the Shares stating that the Shares have not been
               registered under the Act and referring to the restrictions on
               transferability of the Shares, and by stop transfer orders or
               notations on the Company's records referring to the restrictions
               on transferability.

3.        The undersigned has been advised that the Shares are not being
          registered under the Act or any other securities laws pursuant to
          exemptions from the Act and such laws, and that the Company's reliance
          upon such exemptions is predicated in part on the undersigned's
          representations to the Company as contained herein. The undersigned
          represents and warrants that the Shares are being purchased for his,
          her or its own account and for investment and without the intention of
          reselling or redistributing the same, that he, she or it has made no
          agreement with others regarding any of such Shares and that his, her
          or its financial condition is such that it is not likely that it will
          be necessary to dispose of any of such Shares in the foreseeable
          future. The undersigned is aware that, in the view of the Securities
          and Exchange Commission, a purchase of Shares with an intent to resell
          by reason of any foreseeable specific contingency or anticipated
          change in market value, or

                                       2

<PAGE>

          any change in the condition of the Company or its business, or in
          connection with a contemplated liquidation or settlement of any loan
          obtained for the acquisition of the Shares and for which the Shares
          were pledged as security, would represent an intent inconsistent with
          the representations set forth above. The undersigned further
          represents and agrees that if, contrary to his, her or its foregoing
          intentions, he, she or it should later desire to dispose of or
          transfer any of such Shares in any manner, he, she or it shall not do
          so without first obtaining (a) the opinion of counsel designated by
          the Company that such proposed disposition or transfer lawfully may be
          made without the registration of such Shares for such purpose pursuant
          to the Act, as then in effect, and any other applicable securities
          laws, or (b) such registrations (it being expressly understood that
          except as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of
          the date hereof, the Company shall not have any obligation to register
          the Shares for such purpose).

               The undersigned agrees that the Company may place a restrictive
          legend on the certificate(s) representing the Shares, containing
          substantially the following language:

               THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED
               WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
               (THE "ACT"), AND WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER ANY OTHER SECURITIES
               LAWS, IN RELIANCE UPON EXEMPTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ACT AND SUCH
               LAWS. NO TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN MAY
               BE MADE IN THE ABSENCE OF EITHER AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
               STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT AND UNDER THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
               LAWS, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT
               SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND
               UNDER APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. FURTHER, THESE SECURITIES
               ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY AS SET FORTH IN THE
               STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT APPLICABLE TO THE ISSUANCE OF THESE
               SECURITIES.

               The undersigned agrees and consents that the Company may place a
          stop transfer order on the certificate(s) representing the Shares to
          assure the undersigned's compliance with this Agreement and the
          matters referenced above.

               The undersigned agrees to save and hold harmless, defend and
          indemnify the Company and its directors, officers and agents from any
          claims, liabilities, damages, losses, expenses or penalties arising
          out of any misrepresentation of information furnished by the
          undersigned to the Company in this Agreement.

               The undersigned understands that the Company at a future date may
          file a registration or offering statement (the "Registration
          Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission to facilitate
          a public offering of its securities. The undersigned agrees, for the
          benefit of the Company, that should an underwritten public offering be
          made and should the managing underwriter of such offering require, the
          undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the Company
          and such underwriter, during the Lock Up Period as defined herein: (a)
          sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell, transfer or
          otherwise dispose of any of the Shares beneficially held by the
          undersigned during the Lock Up Period; (b) sell, transfer or otherwise
          dispose of, or agree to sell,

                                       3

<PAGE>

          transfer or otherwise dispose of any options, rights or warrants to
          purchase any of the Shares beneficially held by the undersigned during
          the Lock Up Period; or (c) sell or grant, or agree to sell or grant,
          options, rights or warrants with respect to any of the Shares. The
          foregoing does not prohibit gifts to donees or transfers by will or
          the laws of descent to heirs or beneficiaries provided that such
          donees, heirs and beneficiaries shall be bound by the restrictions set
          forth herein. The term "Lock Up Period" shall mean the lesser of (x)
          240 days or (y) the period during which Company officers and directors
          are restricted by the managing underwriter from effecting any sales or
          transfers of the Company's securities. The Lock Up Period shall
          commence on the effective date of the Registration Statement.
