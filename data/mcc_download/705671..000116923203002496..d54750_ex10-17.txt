             Amendment No. 4 to Omega Employee Stock Ownership Plan

                           OMEGA FINANCIAL CORPORATION

                          EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

                      (Restated, Effective January 1, 1997)

                                 AMENDMENT NO. 4

      Omega Financial Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Employer"),
hereby adopts this amendment to the Omega Financial Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ("Plan"). This amendment is adopted pursuant to Section 17.01 of
the Plan.

      1. Section 7.05(c) of the Plan is hereby amended to read as follows:

            "(c) Portion of Account Subject to Diversification. An election by a
      Participant to diversify the investments in his/her Company Stock
      Subaccount pursuant to this Section shall not exceed the number of shares
      determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Stock allocated
      to such Participant's Company Stock Subaccount (including shares of
      Company Stock the value of which has been previously diversified pursuant
      to this Section), by 25% or, with respect to the last Plan Year in the
      Qualified Election Period, 50%, reduced by the number of shares of Company
      Stock of any prior diversification made pursuant to this Section.
      Notwithstanding the preceding sentence to the contrary, during the ninety
      days following the end of each Plan Year after the Qualified Election
      Period, a Participant may elect to diversify the investments in his/her
      Company Stock Subaccount provided that the diversification shall not
      exceed the number of shares determined by multiplying the number of shares
      of Company Stock allocated to such Participant's Company Stock Subaccount
      (including shares of Company Stock the value of which has been previously
      diversified pursuant to this Section), by 50%, reduced by the number of
      shares of Company Stock of any prior diversification made pursuant to this
      Section. The diversification election provided in the preceding sentence
      shall not be available to a Participant if such election would cause the
      Plan to violate the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code."

      2. This amendment shall be effective as of January 1, 2003.


                                       41

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and as evidence of the adoption of this amendment, the

officers this 27th day of January, 2003.
