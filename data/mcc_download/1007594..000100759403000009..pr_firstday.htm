<p>First Day Orders Enable PCD Inc. to Conduct Business as Usual</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peabody, MA, March 27, 2003 - PCD Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: PCDI.OB), a
manufacturer of electronic connectors, announced today that on March 25, 3003,
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts has approved orders
that will enable PCD and its U.S. subsidiary, Wells-CTI, Inc., to conduct their
operations in the ordinary course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day orders approve an interim agreement between PCD and the
Agent for its senior secured lending group which will allow PCD to meet all of
its operating requirements through the use of its current cash reserves and its
revenues from operations, in accordance with an agreed budget. Accordingly, PCD
will be able to use these funds to pay suppliers in full, under normal terms,
for all goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, and to
maintain operational stability as PCD moves through the transition period with
Amphenol Corporation and UMD Technology Inc., the purchasers of PCD's two
business divisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Court approved an order authorizing PCD to pay its
current employees prepetition wages and compensation up to the statutory limit  and to continue health and other benefit programs. The
order also authorizes PCD to pay any and all local, state and federal
withholding and payroll-related taxes pertaining to prepetition periods. By
order of the Court, all banks are directed to receive, process, honor and pay
any and all checks drawn on the payroll and general disbursement accounts
related to employee obligations of PCD and its business, regardless of whether
such checks are presented to banks before or after the date of PCD's Chapter 11
filing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing and as required under
Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, PCD and Wells-CTI also filed a motion
for sales of their assets free and clear of liens and encumbrances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced on March 21, 2003, to facilitate the sales of PCD's two
business divisions: the Industrial/Avionics Division, headquartered in Peabody,
MA, and Wells-CTI Division, headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, PCD Inc. and its
domestic subsidiary, Wells-CTI, Inc., filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11
of the Code. The Company's Japanese subsidiary, Wells-CTI KK, was not included
in the bankruptcy filings, although its shares will be included in the sale of
Wells-CTI. The Chapter 11 filings allows the assets of the domestic entities to
be sold free and clear of certain liabilities that the prospective purchasers do
not wish to assume.</p>
