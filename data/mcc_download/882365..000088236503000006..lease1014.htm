Tenant is neither in default at the time of exercise nor has Tenant ever been in default
(irrespective of the fact that Tenant cured such default) of any monetary obligations
under this Lease more than twice during the Term and such monetary default aggregates in
excess of $20,000, and Tenant is fully occupying the Premises and the Lease is in full
force and effect, Tenant shall have the right to renew this Lease for one term of five (5)
years beyond the end of the Term (&#147;Renewal Term&#148;). Tenant shall furnish written
notice of intent to renew nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Term, failing
which, such renewal right shall be deemed waived; time being of the essence. The terms and
conditions of this Lease during the Renewal Term shall remain unchanged except that the
annual Fixed Rent for the Renewal Term shall be the Fair Market Rent (as such term is
hereinafter defined). All factors regarding Additional Rent shall remain unchanged, and no
Tenant Allowance shall be included in the absence of further agreement by the parties.
Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall have no right to
renew the term hereof other than or beyond the one five (5) year term hereinabove
described. It shall be a condition of the Renewal Term that Landlord and Tenant shall have
executed, not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then expiring term
hereof, an appropriate amendment to this Lease, in form and content satisfactory to each
of them, memorializing the extension of the term hereof for the Renewal Term. </FONT>

<TD WIDTH=95%><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Lease, &#147;Fair Market Rent&#148; shall mean the base rent, for
comparable space, taking into account all free or reduced rent periods, work letters, cash
allowances, fit-out periods and other tenant inducement concessions however denominated.
In determining the Fair Market Rent, Landlord, Tenant and any appraiser shall take into
account applicable measurement and the loss factors, applicable lengths of lease term,
differences in size of the space demised, the location of the Building and comparable
buildings, amenities in the Building and comparable buildings, the ages of the Building
and comparable buildings, differences in base years or stop amounts for operating expenses
and tax escalations and other factors normally taken into account in determining Fair
Market Rent. The Fair Market Rent shall reflect the level of improvement to be made by
Landlord to the space and the Recognized Expenses and Taxes under this Lease. If Landlord
and Tenant cannot agree on the Fair Market Rent, the Fair Market Rent shall be established
by the following procedure: (1) Tenant and Landlord shall each select an MAI certified
appraiser who shall have a minimum of ten (10) years experience in commercial real estate
leasing in the market in which the Premises is located, (2) the two appraisers selected by
each of the Landlord and Tenant shall select a third MAI certified appraiser who shall
have a minimum of ten (10) years experience in commercial real estate leasing in the
market in which the Premises is located, (3) during the next seven (7) days the third
appraiser shall determine the Fair Market Rent, which determination shall be final and
binding upon the Landlord and the Tenant. The fees of the appraisers shall be shared

          satisfaction of any claim, remedy or cause of action accruing to Tenant as a
          result of the breach of any section of this Lease by Landlord. In addition to
