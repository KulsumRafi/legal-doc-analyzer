Ladies and Gentlemen:

             1.  Introductory. Remington Arms Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions
stated herein, to issue and sell to the several initial purchasers named in
Schedule A hereto (the "Purchasers") U.S.$200,000,000 principal amount of its
10-1/2% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Notes"), to be issued under an indenture, to
be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined below) (the "Indenture"), among the
Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) party hereto and U.S. Bank National
Association, as Trustee on a private placement basis pursuant to an exemption
under Section 4(2) of the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities
Act").

          The holders of the Offered Securities (as defined below) will be
entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement to be dated the
Closing Date among the Company, the Guarantors and the Purchasers (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"), pursuant to which the Issuers (as defined
below) will agree to use their reasonable best efforts to file a registration
statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "Commission") registering
the resale of the Offered Securities under the Securities Act.

          The Notes will be guaranteed by all existing domestic Subsidiaries and
by all Subsidiaries that in the future guarantee certain other indebtedness of
the Company, if any (as defined in the Indenture), each of which will become a
guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (collectively, the
"Guarantors") and will unconditionally guarantee the Notes (the "Guarantees")
subject in each case to release in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
The Notes and Guarantees are referred to collectively as the "Offered
Securities." The Company and the Guarantors to be party to the Indenture on the
Closing Date are referred to collectively as the "Issuers."

          The Company and the Guarantors hereby agree with the several
Purchasers as follows:

             2.  Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the several Purchasers that:

                 (a)  A preliminary offering circular and an offering circular
          relating to the Offered Securities to be offered by the Purchasers
          have been prepared by the Issuers. Such preliminary offering circular
          (the "Preliminary Offering Circular") and offering circular, as
          supplemented as of the date of this Agreement (the "Offering
          Circular"). On the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date, the
          Offering Circular does not and will not include any untrue statement
          of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
          stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
          in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

<PAGE>

          misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or
          omissions from the Offering Circular based upon written information
          furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through Credit Suisse First
          Boston LLC ("CSFBC") specifically for use therein, it being understood
          and agreed that the only such information with respect to the Company
          is that described as such in Section 7(b) hereof. The Offering
          Circular, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contains, or will
          contain, all of the information that, if requested by a prospective
          purchaser of the Notes, would be required to be provided to such
          prospective purchaser pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
          Act.

                 (b)  The Offered Securities have been duly authorized by each
          of the Issuers. When the Notes are delivered and paid for pursuant to
          this Agreement and the Indenture on the Closing Date, the Notes will
          have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will
          conform to the description thereof contained in the Offering Circular
          and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
          Company, entitled to the benefits provided in the Indenture and
          enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to (i) bankruptcy,
          insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other
          similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
          generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
          enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the
          discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
          brought.

                 (c)  Each of the Issuers has been duly incorporated or
          organized and is an existing corporation or other entity in good
          standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and
          authority (corporate and other organizational) to own its properties
          and conduct its business as described in the Offering Circular; and
          each of the Issuers is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
          corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its
          ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires
          such qualification, except in such jurisdictions in which the failure
          to so qualify would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
          or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business,
          properties, results of operations or condition (financial or other) of
          the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole ( a "Material
          Adverse Effect").

                 (d)  Each subsidiary of the Company listed on Schedule C hereto
          has been duly incorporated or organized and is an existing corporation
          or other entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
          its incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other
          organizational) to own its properties and conduct its business as
          described in the Offering Circular; and each subsidiary of the Company
          is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good
          standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of
          property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
          except in such jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify would
          not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
          a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding capital
          stock of each subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and
          validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and the capital
          stock of each subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through
          subsidiaries, is owned free from liens, encumbrances and defects,
          except as (i) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
          or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) may exist or
          arise pursuant to or in connection with the existing credit agreement
          or (iii) disclosed in the Offering Circular.

                 (e)  The Indenture has been duly authorized by each Issuer; and
          when the Notes are delivered and paid for pursuant to this Agreement
          on the Closing Date, the Indenture will have been duly executed and
          delivered and will conform to the description thereof contained in the
          Offering Circular and the Indenture will constitute the valid and
          legally binding obligation of the

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

          Issuers, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
          bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
          moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
          affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

                 (f)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, there are no
          contracts, agreements or understandings between any Issuer and any
          person that would give rise to a valid claim against any Issuer or any
          Purchaser for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like
          payment in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes.

                 (g)  No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or
          filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required
          for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Offering Circular
          in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company
          except for (i) the order of the Commission declaring the Exchange
          Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement (each
          as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) effective, (ii) such
          consents, approvals, authorizations, orders or filings as may be
          required to be obtained or made under the Securities Act, the Trust
          Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act") and
          applicable state securities laws as provided in the Registration
          Rights Agreement, (iii) such consents, approvals, authorizations,
          orders or filings as have been made or obtained, or (iv) as disclosed
          in the Offering Circular.

                 (h)  The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture,
          this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and the issuance
          and sale of the Notes and compliance with the terms and provisions
          thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms
          and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any statute, any
          rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any
          court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over any Issuer or any
          subsidiary of any Issuer or any of their properties, or any agreement
          or instrument to which any Issuer or any such subsidiary is a party or
          by which any Issuer or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of
          the properties of the Issuers or any such subsidiary is subject, or
          the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any Issuer
          or any such subsidiary, except for such breaches, violations and
          defaults (other than with respect to the charter of any Issuer or its
          subsidiaries) as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and each
          Issuer has full power and authority (corporate and other
          organizational) to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities as
          contemplated by this Agreement.

                 (i)  This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
          delivered by each Issuer.

                 (j)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, the Issuers
          and their respective subsidiaries have good and marketable title to
          all real properties and good and valid title to all other properties
          and assets owned by them, in each case free from liens, encumbrances
          and defects, except for such failures to have such title and for such
          liens, encumbrances and defects as (i) would not reasonably be
          expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
          Effect, (ii) may exist or arise pursuant to or in connection with the
          existing credit agreement or (iii) disclosed in the Offering Circular;
          and except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, the Issuers and
          their respective subsidiaries hold any leased real or personal
          property under valid and enforceable leases, except for such failures
          to be so valid or enforceable as would not reasonably be expected to
          have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                 (k)  The Issuers and their respective subsidiaries possess
          adequate certificates, authorities

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

          or permits issued by appropriate governmental agencies or bodies
          necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except as
          would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
          aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and have not received any notice
          of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such
          certificate, authority or permit that would be reasonably expected to
          have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                 (l)  No labor dispute with the employees of the Issuers or any
          subsidiary exists or, to the knowledge of the Issuers, is threatened
          that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
          aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                 (m)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, the Issuers
          and their respective subsidiaries own, possess or can acquire on
          reasonable terms adequate rights to use all material trademarks, trade
          names and other rights to inventions, know-how, patents, copyrights,
          confidential information and other intellectual property
          (collectively, "intellectual property rights") necessary to conduct
          the business now operated by them, or presently employed by them,
          except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
          the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and have not received any
          notice of infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others
          with respect to any intellectual property rights that would reasonably
          be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
          Adverse Effect.

                 (n)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, no Issuer or
          any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any applicable statute,
          rule, regulation, decision or order of any governmental agency or body
          or any court, domestic or foreign, relating to the use, disposal or
          release of hazardous or toxic substances or relating to the protection
          or restoration of the environment or human exposure to hazardous or
          toxic substances (collectively, "environmental laws"), owns or
          operates any real property contaminated with any substance that is
          subject to any applicable environmental laws, is liable for any
          off-site disposal or contamination pursuant to any applicable
          environmental laws, or is subject to any claim relating to any
          applicable environmental laws, which violation, contamination,
          liability or claim would reasonably be expected to have, individually
          or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the Company's
          knowledge, no such claim is threatened.

                 (o)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, there are no
          pending actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting any of the
          Issuers, any of their respective subsidiaries or any of their
          respective properties that would reasonably be expected to have,
          individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or would
          materially and adversely affect the ability of the Issuers to perform
          their respective obligations under the Indenture, this Agreement or
          the Registration Rights Agreement; and to the Issuers' knowledge, no
          such actions, suits or proceedings are threatened.

                 (p)  The historical consolidated financial statements
          (including the related notes) included in the Offering Circular
          present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the
          Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates shown and
          their results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown, and
          such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
          generally accepted accounting principles in the United States applied
          on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby; and the
          assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial data included in
          the Offering Circular provide a reasonable basis for presenting the
          significant effects directly attributable to the transactions or
          events described therein, the related pro forma adjustments give
          appropriate effect to those assumptions, and the pro forma columns
          therein reflect the proper application of those adjustments to the
          corresponding historical financial

                                       -4-

          statement amounts.

                 (q)  Except as disclosed in the Offering Circular, since the
          date of the latest audited financial statements included in the
          Offering Circular there has been no development or event that would
          reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
          Material Adverse Effect, and, except as disclosed in the Offering
          Circular, there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind
          declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of its capital
          stock.

                 (r)  The Company is exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule
          12g3-2(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
          Act").

                 (s)  The Company is not an open-end investment company, unit
          investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is required
          to be registered under Section 8 of the United States Investment
          Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"); and the Company is
          not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes and
          the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Offering
          Circular, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the
          Investment Company Act.

                 (t)  No securities of the Company of the same class (within the
          meaning of Rule 144A(d)(3) under the Securities Act) as the Notes are
          listed on any national securities exchange registered under Section 6
          of the Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer
          quotation system.

                 (u)  Assuming the accuracy of the representations, warranties
          and agreements of the Initial Purchasers contained in Section 4
          hereof, the offer and sale of the Notes by the Company and the offer
          of the Guarantees by the Guarantors to the several Purchasers in the
          manner contemplated by this Agreement will be exempt from the
          registration requirements of the Securities Act by reason of Section
          4(2) thereof and Regulation S thereunder and it is not necessary to
          qualify an indenture in respect of the Offered Securities under the
          United States Trust Indenture Act.

                 (v)  Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Purchasers, as to
          whom the Company makes no representation) (i) has, within the
          six-month period prior to the date hereof, offered or sold in the
          United States or to any U.S. person (as such terms are defined in
          Regulation S under the Securities Act) the Offered Securities or any
          security of the same class or series as the Offered Securities or (ii)
          has offered or will offer or sell the Offered Securities (A) in the
          United States by means of any form of general solicitation or general
          advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) under the Securities Act
          or (B) with respect to any such securities sold in reliance on Rule
          903 of Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act, by
          means of any directed selling efforts within the meaning of Rule
          902(c) of Regulation S. The Issuers, their affiliates and any person
          acting on their behalf (other than the Purchasers, as to whom the
          Company makes no representation) have complied and will comply with
          the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S. The Issuers
          have not entered and will not enter into any contractual arrangement
          with respect to the distribution of the Offered Securities except for
          this Agreement prior to its termination.

                 (w)  The statistical and market-related data included in the
          Offering Circular are based on or derived from sources that the
          Company reasonably believes to be reliable and accurate; and the
          Guarantors do not believe such sources to be unreliable or inaccurate.

                 (x)  There is no "substantial U.S. market interest" as defined
          in Rule 902(j) of Regulation

                                       -5-

<PAGE>

          S in the Company's debt securities.

                 (y)  The Company (i) makes and keeps materially accurate books
          and records and (ii) maintains internal accounting controls that
          provide reasonable assurance that (A) transactions are executed in
          accordance with management's authorization, (B) transactions are
          recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial
          statements and to maintain accountability for its assets, (C) access
          to its assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
          authorization and (D) the reported accountability for its assets is
          compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals.

                 (z)  The Indenture conforms in all material respects to the
          requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations
          of the Commission applicable to an indenture which is qualified
          thereunder.

                 (aa) On the Closing Date, the Guarantee of the Notes by each
          Guarantor will have been duly authorized by such Guarantor and will
          conform to the description thereof contained in the Offering Circular
          in all material respects. When the Notes have been issued, executed
          and authenticated in accordance with the Indenture and delivered to
          and paid for by the Purchasers in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement, the Guarantee of each Guarantor will constitute a valid and
          legally binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable in
          accordance with its terms, subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
          reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
          laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
          generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
          enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the
          discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
          brought.

                 (bb) On the Closing Date, the Registration Rights Agreement
          will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers.
          When the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly executed and
          delivered, the Registration Rights Agreement will be a valid and
          binding agreement of the Issuers, enforceable against each Issuer in
          accordance with its terms, (x) except as to rights of indemnity or
          contribution, or both, that may be limited by state and federal laws
          or public policy underlying such laws and (y) subject to (i)
          bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,
          moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
          to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity
          (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
          equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any
          proceeding therefor may be brought. On the Closing Date, the
          Registration Rights Agreement will conform as to legal matters to the
          description thereof in the Offering Circular in all material respects.

                 (cc) No Issuer or any of its subsidiaries is in violation of
          its respective charter, by-laws or other organizational documents or
          in default in any material respect in the performance of any
          obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any
          indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, lease or other agreement or
          instrument, to which any Issuer or any of its subsidiaries is a party
          or by which any Issuer or any of its subsidiaries or their respective
          property is bound, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be
          expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
          Effect.

                 (dd) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any
          agent thereof acting on their behalf has taken, and none of them will
          take, any action that would cause this Agreement or the issuance or
          sale of the Notes to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation
          X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                 (ee) No "nationally recognized statistical rating organization"
          as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the
          Securities Act (i) has imposed (or has informed any Issuer that it is
          considering imposing) any condition (financial or otherwise) on an
          Issuer retaining any rating assigned to any debt securities of such
          Issuer or (ii) has indicated to any Issuer that it is considering (a)
          the downgrading, suspension, or withdrawal of, or any review for a
          possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible
          change in, any rating so assigned or (b) any change in the outlook for
          any rating on the debt securities of such Issuer.

                 (ff) No form of general solicitation or general advertising (as
          defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act) was used by the
          Issuers or any of their respective representatives (other than the
          Purchasers, as to whom the Issuers make no representation) in
          connection with the offer and sale of the Offered Securities
          contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, articles, notices
          or other communications published in any newspaper, magazine or
          similar medium or broadcast over television or radio, or any seminar
          or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general
          solicitation or general advertising. No securities of the same class
          as the Offered Securities have been issued and sold by any of the
          Issuers within the six-month period immediately prior to the date
          hereof.

                 (gg) Each of the Issuers has filed all necessary federal, state
          and foreign income and franchise tax returns, except where the failure
          to so file such returns would not reasonably be expected to have,
          individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and has
          paid all taxes shown as due thereon; and other than tax deficiencies
          which the Issuers are contesting in good faith and for which adequate
          reserves have been provided in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles, there is no tax deficiency that has been
          asserted against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that would
          reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
          Material Adverse Effect.

                 (hh) On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the offering
          and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as
          described in the Offering Circular, (i) the fair value and present
          fair saleable value of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries
          on a going concern basis will exceed the sum of its stated liabilities
          and identified contingent liabilities; and (ii) each of the Company
          and its subsidiaries is not, nor will it be (a) left with unreasonably
          small capital with which to carry on its business as it is proposed to
          be conducted, (b) unable to pay its debts (contingent or otherwise) as
          they mature or (c) otherwise insolvent. In computing the amount of
          such contingent liabilities at any time, it is intended that such
          liabilities will be computed at the amount that, in the light of all
          the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represent the
          amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
          liability.

             3.  Purchase, Sale and Delivery of Offered Securities. On the basis
of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, but subject
to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to the
Purchasers, and the Purchasers agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase
from the Company the Notes, in the respective amounts of the Notes set forth
opposite the names of the several Purchasers in Schedule A hereto, at a purchase
price of 97.0% of the principal amount thereof.

          The Company will deliver against payment of the purchase price the
Notes in the form of one or more permanent global Securities in definitive form
(the "Global Securities") deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee for DTC. Interests in any permanent Global Securities will be held only
in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in
the Offering Circular. Payment for the Notes shall be made by the Purchasers in
Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account at a bank reasonably
acceptable to

                                       -7-

<PAGE>

CSFBC drawn to such order as the Company shall direct. Delivery of the Global
Securities will be made at the office of Cahill Gordon & Reindel at 9:00 A.M.
(New York time), on January 24, 2003, or at such other time not later than seven
full business days thereafter as CSFBC and the Company determine, such time
being herein referred to as the "Closing Date", against delivery to the Trustee
as custodian for DTC of the Global Securities representing all of the Notes.

             4.  Representations by Purchasers; Resale by Purchasers.

                 (a)  Each Purchaser severally represents and warrants to the
          Company that it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
          Regulation D under the Securities Act.

                 (b)  Each Purchaser severally acknowledges that the Notes have
          not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
          sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
          U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to an
          exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
          Each Purchaser severally represents and agrees that it has offered and
          sold the Notes, and will offer and sell the Notes, (i) as part of its
          distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until the later of the
          commencement of the offering and the Closing Date, only in accordance
          with Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A") or Rule 903
          under the Securities Act. Accordingly, neither such Purchaser nor its
          affiliates, nor any persons acting on its or their behalf, has engaged
          or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the
          Notes, and such Purchaser, its affiliates and all persons acting on
          its or their behalf have complied and will comply with the offering
          restrictions requirement of Regulation S. Each Purchaser severally
          agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of sale of the Notes, other
          than a sale pursuant to Rule 144A, such Purchaser will have sent to
          each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee
          or other remuneration that purchases the Notes from it during the
          restricted period a confirmation or notice to substantially the
          following effect:

                 "The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under
                 the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and may
                 not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for
                 the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of their
                 distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after
                 the later of the date of the commencement of the offering and
                 the closing date, except in either case in accordance with
                 Regulation S (or Rule 144A if available) under the Securities
                 Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by
                 Regulation S."

          Terms used in this subsection (b) have the meanings given to them by
          Regulation S.

                 (c)  Each Purchaser severally agrees that it and each of its
          affiliates has not entered and will not enter into any contractual
          arrangement with respect to the distribution of the Offered Securities
          except for any such arrangements with the other Purchasers or with the
          prior written consent of the Company.

                 (d)  Each Purchaser severally agrees that it and each of its
          affiliates will not offer or sell the Offered Securities in the United
          States by means of any form of general solicitation or general
          advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) under the Securities
          Act, including, but not limited to, (i) any advertisement, article,
          notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or
          similar media or broadcast over television or radio, or (ii) any
          seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general
          solicitation or general advertising. Each Purchaser severally agrees,
          with respect to resales made in reliance on Rule 144A of any of the
          Offered Securities, to deliver either with the confirmation of such
          resale or otherwise prior to

                                       -8-

<PAGE>

          settlement of such resale a notice to the effect that the resale of
          such Offered Securities has been made in reliance upon the exemption
          from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by
          Rule 144A.

             5.  Certain Agreements of the Issuers. The Company and as
applicable, each of the Issuers, agrees with the several Purchasers that:

                 (a)  The Company, on behalf of all of the Issuers, will advise
          CSFBC promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Offering
          Circular and will not effect such amendment or supplementation without
          CSFBC's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
          If, at any time prior to the completion of the resale of the Notes by
          the Purchasers, any event occurs as a result of which the Offering
          Circular as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
          necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is
          necessary at any such time to amend or supplement the Offering
          Circular to comply with any applicable law, the Company, on behalf of
          all of the Issuers, promptly will notify CSFBC of such event and
          promptly will prepare, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement
          which will correct such statement or omission or effect such
          compliance. Neither CSFBC's consent to, nor the Purchasers' delivery
          to offerees or investors of, any such amendment or supplement shall
          constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.

                 (b)  The Company will furnish to CSFBC copies of any
          preliminary offering circular, the Offering Circular and all
          amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as
          available and in such quantities as CSFBC reasonably requests. At any
          time when the Offered Securities are outstanding and are "restricted
          securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities
          Act and the Issuers are not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
          Exchange Act, the Company will promptly (or, in the case of any
          information relating to the Guarantors, upon request) furnish or cause
          to be furnished to CSFBC (and, upon request, to each of the other
          Purchasers) and, upon request of holders and prospective purchasers of
          the Offered Securities, to such holders and purchasers, copies of the
          information required to be delivered to holders and prospective
          purchasers of the Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
          the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) in order to
          permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with resales by such
          holders of the Offered Securities. The Company will pay the expenses
          of printing and distributing to the Purchasers all such documents.

                 (c)  The Company will arrange for the qualification of the
          Notes for sale and the determination of their eligibility for
          investment under the laws of such jurisdictions in the United States
          and Canada as CSFBC reasonably designates and will continue such
          qualifications in effect so long as reasonably required for the
          initial resale of the Notes by the Purchasers, provided that none of
          the Issuers will be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to
          file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction
          or to subject any Issuer to taxation in respect of doing business in
          any state or jurisdiction in which such Issuer is not otherwise so
          subject.

                 (d)  During the period of two years hereafter, unless such
          documents are available electronically via the Electronic Data
          Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system or any successor
          system maintained by the Commission, the Issuers will furnish to CSFBC
          and, upon request, to each of the other Purchasers, (i) as soon as
          available, a copy of each report or other document furnished by the
          Issuers to the Commission pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the
          Exchange Act.

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

                 (e)  During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the
          Company will, upon request, furnish to CSFBC, each of the other
          Purchasers and any holder of Notes a copy of the restrictions on
          transfer applicable to the Notes.

                 (f)  During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the
          Company will not, and will not permit any of their respective
          affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to,
          resell any of the Offered Securities that have been reacquired by any
          of them, except for Notes purchased by the Company or any of its
          affiliates and resold in a transaction registered under the Securities
          Act.

                 (g)  During the period of two years after the Closing Date,
          none of the Issuers will be or become an open-end investment company,
          unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is
          required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company
          Act.

                 (h)  The Company will pay all expenses incidental to the
          performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and
          the Registration Rights Agreement, including (i) the fees and expenses
          of the Trustee and its professional advisers; (ii) all expenses in
          connection with the execution, issue, authentication, packaging and
          initial delivery of the Notes and, as applicable, the Exchange
          Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the
          preparation and printing of this Agreement, the Registration Rights
          Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture, the Offering Circular and
          amendments and supplements thereto, and any other document relating to
          the issuance, offer, sale and delivery of the Notes and, as
          applicable, the Exchange Securities; (iii) the cost of qualifying the
          Notes for trading in The Portal Market ("PORTAL") of The Nasdaq Stock
          Market, Inc. and any expenses incidental thereto; (iv) the cost of any
          advertising approved by the Company in connection with the issue of
          the Offered Securities; (v) any expenses (including reasonable fees
          and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with
          qualification of the Notes or the Exchange Securities for sale under
          the laws of such jurisdictions as CSFBC reasonably designates and the
          printing of memoranda relating thereto; (vi) any fees charged by
          investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities or
          the Exchange Securities and (vii) expenses incurred in distributing
          preliminary offering circulars and the Offering Circular (including
          any amendments and supplements thereto) to the Purchasers. The Company
          will reimburse the Purchasers for all travel expenses of the
          Purchasers' and the Issuers' officers and employees and any other
          expenses of the Purchasers and the Issuers in connection with
          attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of the Notes
          from the Purchasers.

                 (i)  In connection with the offering, until CSFBC shall have
          notified the Company and the other Purchasers of the completion of the
          resale of the Notes, neither the Company nor any of their respective
          affiliates has or will, either alone or with one or more other
          persons, bid for or purchase for any account in which it or any of its
          affiliates has a beneficial interest any Notes or attempt to induce
          any person to purchase any Notes; and neither they nor any of their
          affiliates will make bids or purchases for the purpose of creating
          actual, or apparent, active trading in, or of raising the price of,
          the Notes.

                 (j)  For a period of 180 days after the date of the initial
          offering of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers, the Issuers will
          not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
          directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration
          statement under the Securities Act with respect to, any United States
          dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by any Issuer
          and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue, or
          publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge
          or disposition, or filing, except (i) issuances of Exchange Securities
          pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement or (ii) promissory notes
          or

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

          other debt securities issued or guaranteed in immaterial amounts in
          the ordinary course of business. The Issuers will not at any time
          offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
          directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances where such
          offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption
          afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act to cease to be
          applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

                 (k)  The Issuers will apply the net proceeds from the sale of
          the Notes as set forth under "Use of Proceeds" in the Offering
          Circular.

             6.  Conditions of the Obligations of the Purchasers. The
obligations of the several Purchasers to purchase and pay for the Notes will be
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the
Issuers herein, to the accuracy of the statements of officers of the Issuers
made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Issuers of
their respective obligations hereunder and to the following additional
conditions precedent:

                 (a)  The Purchasers shall have received a letter, dated the
          date of this Agreement, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, substantially
          in the form of Exhibit B hereto or otherwise in form and substance
          reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasers concerning the financial
          information with respect to the Company set forth in the Offering
          Circular.

                 (b)  Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this
          Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any
          development or event that would reasonably be expected to result in a
          change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or
          results of operations of the Issuers and their respective subsidiaries
          taken as a whole which, in the reasonable judgment of a majority in
          interest of the Purchasers, including CSFBC is material and adverse
          and makes it impractical to proceed with completion of the offering or
          the sale of and payment for the Notes; (ii) any downgrading in the
          rating of any debt securities of the Issuers by any "nationally
          recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes
          of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement
          that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating
          of any debt securities of the Issuers (other than an announcement with
          positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a
          possible downgrading, of such rating) or any announcement that the
          Company has been placed on negative outlook; (iii) any material
          adverse change in U.S. or international financial, political or
          economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as
          would, in the reasonable judgment of a majority in interest of the
          Purchasers including CSFBC, be likely to prejudice materially the
          success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Offered
          Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in
          the secondary market; (iv) any material suspension or material
          limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock
          Exchange or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such
          exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the
          Issuers on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (v) any
          banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities;
          (vi) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance
          services in the United States or (vii) any material attack on,
          outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving
          the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other
          national or international calamity or emergency if, in the reasonable
          judgment of a majority in interest of the Purchasers including CSFBC,
          the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, act, declaration,
          calamity or emergency makes it impractical to proceed with completion
          of the offering or sale of and payment for the Offered Securities.

                 (c)  The Purchasers shall have received an opinion, dated the
          Closing Date, of Debevoise & Plimpton, counsel for the Issuers,
          substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, or otherwise in form
          and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasers:

          Reindel, counsel for the Purchasers, such opinion or opinions, dated
          the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Issuers,
          the validity of the Notes, the Offering Circular, the exemption from

          may reasonably require, and the Issuers shall have furnished to such
          counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of
          enabling them to pass upon such matters.

                 (e)  The Purchasers shall have received a certificate, dated
          the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a
          principal financial or accounting officer of each Issuer in which such
          officers shall state that, to their knowledge after due inquiry, the
          representations and warranties of the Issuers in this Agreement are
          true and correct, that the Issuers have complied with all agreements
          and satisfied all conditions on their part to be performed or
          satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, and that, to
          their knowledge after due inquiry, subsequent to the dates of the most
          recent financial statements in the Offering Circular there has been no
          Material Adverse Effect, nor any development or event that would
          reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
          a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated by
          the Offering Circular.

                 (f)  The Purchasers shall have received a letter, dated the
          Closing Date, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP which meets the
          requirements of subsection (a) of this Section, except that the
          specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more
          than two days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this
          subsection.

                 (g)  The Company shall have furnished to the Purchasers such
          further certificates and documents confirming the representations and
          warranties, covenants and conditions contained herein and related
          matters (including with respect to subsection (i) below) as the
          Purchasers may reasonably have requested.

                 (h)  The Notes shall have been designated for trading on
          PORTAL.

                 (i)  Each of the Issuers and the Trustee shall have executed

                 (j)  Each of the Issuers shall have executed and delivered the

                 (k)  The Purchasers shall have received a certificate, dated
          the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a
          principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such

          after due inquiry, the representations and warranties set forth in

          The Company will furnish the Purchasers with such conformed copies of
such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Purchasers reasonably
request. CSFBC may in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Purchasers
compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Purchasers hereunder,
whether in respect of the Closing Date or otherwise.

             7.  Indemnification and Contribution.

                 (a)  The Issuers will indemnify and hold harmless each
          Purchaser, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if
          any, who controls such Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of
          the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
          liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become
          subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise,
          insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
          respect thereof) arise out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
          statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Circular, or
          any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary
          offering circular, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
          alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
          stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
          in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
          misleading, including any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
          arising out of or based upon the Issuers' failure to perform its
          obligations under Section 5(a) of this Agreement, and will reimburse
          each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
          such Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such
          loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are
          incurred; provided, however, that the Issuers will not be liable in
          any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
          liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
          alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any
          of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written
          information furnished to the Issuers by any Purchaser through CSFBC
          specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the
          only such information consists of the information described as such in
          subsection (b) below, and provided, further, that the foregoing
          indemnity with respect to the preliminary offering circular shall not
          inure to the benefit of any Purchaser from whom the person asserting
          any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Notes, to
          the extent that any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities of
          such Purchaser result solely from the fact that such Purchaser sold
          Notes to a person in an initial resale to whom there was not sent or
          given at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such
          Notes, a copy of the final offering circular (as amended and
          supplemented), if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof
          to such Purchaser sufficient to allow for a timely distribution prior
          to confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such person by such
          Purchaser and the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of such
          Purchaser result from an untrue statement or omission of a material
          fact contained in the preliminary offering circular, which was
          corrected in the final offering circular.

                 (b)  Each Purchaser will severally and not jointly indemnify
          and hold harmless each Issuer, its directors and officers and each
          person, if any, who controls such Issuer within the meaning of Section
          15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
          liabilities to which such Issuer may become subject, under the
          Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such
          losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
          arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
          statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Circular, or
          any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary
          offering circular, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
          the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
          stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
          in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
          misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
          such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
          alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
          written information furnished to the Issuers by such Purchaser through
          CSFBC specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or
          other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with
          investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
          action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed
          that the only such information furnished by any Purchaser consists of
          the following information in the Offering Circular furnished on behalf
          of each Purchaser in the

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

          eighth and ninth paragraphs and the fourth sentence of the tenth
          paragraph under the caption "Plan of Distribution"; provided, however,
          that the Purchasers shall not be liable for any losses, claims,
          damages or liabilities arising out of or based upon the Company's
          failure, after notice of such failure is provided to the Company, to
          perform its obligations under Section 5(a) of this Agreement.

                 (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
          Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
          party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
          indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the
          indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to
          notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability
          which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under
          subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought
          against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party
          of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled
          to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly
          with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
          defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
          indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
          indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after
          notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
          election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will
          not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any
          legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified
          party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
          costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
          written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
          pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party
          is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
          hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes
          (i) an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
          liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and
          (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault or
          failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

                 (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section is
          unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party
          under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall
          contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as
          a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in
          subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate
          to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one
          hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Offered
          Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is
          not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
          to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)
          above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and
          the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or
          omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
          liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          The relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the
          Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion
          as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
          expenses) received by the Issuers bear to the total discounts and
          commissions received by the Purchasers from the Issuers under this
          Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
          among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of
          a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
          material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the
          Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
          information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue
          statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a
          result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in
          the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include
          any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
          party in connection with investigating or defending any action or
          claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

          provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to
          contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price
          at which the Notes purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of
          any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by
          reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
          alleged omission. The Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d)
          to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase
          obligations and not joint.

                 (e)  The obligations of the Issuers under this Section shall be
          in addition to any liability which the Issuers may otherwise have and
          shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if
          any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities
          Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under
          this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the
          respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the
          same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the
          Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

             8.  Default of Purchasers. If any Purchaser or Purchasers default
in their obligations to purchase Notes hereunder and the aggregate principal
amount of Notes that such defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers agreed but failed
to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Notes, CSFBC
may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Notes
by other persons, including any of the Purchasers, but if no such arrangements
are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Purchasers shall be obligated
severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase
the Notes that such defaulting Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any
Purchaser or Purchasers so default and the aggregate principal amount of Notes
with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total
principal amount of Notes and arrangements satisfactory to CSFBC and the Company
for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours
after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part
of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Issuers, except as provided in Section 9.
As used in this Agreement, the term "Purchaser" includes any person substituted
for a Purchaser under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting
Purchaser from liability for its default.

             9.  Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations; Payment of
Expenses. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Issuers or its officers and of the several
Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the
results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Purchaser, the Issuers or any of
their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling
person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase
of the Notes by the Purchasers is not consummated, the Company shall remain
responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section
5 and the respective obligations of the Issuers and the Purchasers pursuant to
Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Notes by the Purchasers
is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified
in clause (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 6(b), the Issuers will
reimburse the Purchasers for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection
with the offering of the Offered Securities.

             10. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and,
if sent to the Purchasers will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed
to the Purchasers, c/o Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue,

Chief Financial Officer; provided, however, that any notice to a Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7 will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to
such Purchaser.

             11. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the
controlling persons referred to in Section 7, and no other person will have any
right or obligation hereunder, except that holders of Offered Securities shall
be entitled to enforce the agreements for their benefit contained in the second
and third sentences of Section 5(b) hereof against the Issuers as if such
holders were parties thereto.

             12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.

             13. Applicable Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

          This Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto
hereunder shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with
laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles or rules
of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily
applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.

          Each Issuer hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
Federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in
any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.
