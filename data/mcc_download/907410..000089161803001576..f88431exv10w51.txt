        shall be obligated to disclose it (to be treated as ***) to the other
        party immediately.

        ESS and Counterparty* agree to meet on a quarterly basis to reconcile

        provide firm wafer P.O. information to ***. *** agree that *** will
        invoice or/and ship *** all the finished Combined Products within 30
        days of ***'s receipt of these finished Combined Product from the

        The parties agree to work together in developing testing programs for
        the Combined Products, do yield improvement, and resolve any quality
        issues.

        Facility for the assembly, packaging, and testing of the Combined
        Products. In the event Counterparty* decides not to provide the package

        Combined Products either itself or with Counterparty*'s prior written
        consent, through a third party. Sales of such Products shall only be
        together with, or for use with ESS/Counterparty* Combined Products.
        Whether such manufacture is by ESS or by a third party, ESS shall pay
        Counterparty* profit shares according to the formula stipulated in the
        Agreement.

        Payment terms are *** for all sales of inventory between the parties.

        3. Exhibit A "Specification" "2. Features of each Combined Product"

        ESS and Counterparty* agree that the Basic Features Combined Product
        Sold Ratio shall not be less than ***%. If the above Ratio is less than
        ***%, then both parties agree to treat the *** as *** for profit sharing

        apply until the cumulated Ratio is more than ***%.
