          This NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into
as of March 28, 2003 (the "Closing Date"), by and among Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, a Massachusetts corporation ("Vertex"), and
Invitrogen Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Invitrogen").

                                       INTRODUCTION

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement by and among
Vertex, PanVera LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Seller"), and
Invitrogen dated as of February 4, 2003 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), the
Seller has sold to Invitrogen the Business Assets (as such term is defined in
the Asset Purchase Agreement), and Invitrogen has assumed from the Seller the
Assumed Liabilities (as such term is defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement);
and

         WHEREAS, Vertex is the sole member of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (San
Diego) LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Vertex SD") and Vertex SD
is the sole member of Seller; and

         WHEREAS, this Agreement is entered into pursuant to, and was a
condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by, the
Asset Purchase Agreement. Vertex acknowledges that Invitrogen would not

Liabilities pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement without the benefit of
the agreements set forth herein. Vertex further acknowledges that without the
restrictions set forth herein, Invitrogen's business and the value of the
Business Assets and the Assumed Liabilities will be materially adversely
affected.

         (b) RESEARCH FIELD.

              (i) During the Restricted Period, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 2, neither Vertex nor any Vertex Party shall sell or

purport to sell or otherwise transfer to a party other than a Vertex Party,

Affiliate of Vertex shall sell or otherwise transfer, nor attempt or purport
to sell or otherwise transfer, any Product for use in the Research Field or
provide any Service in the Research Field that employs any technology claimed
or covered in the Genomescreen Patent Rights or GeneDriver Patent Rights.

         (c) Other than the restrictions set forth in Section 2(a) which
shall remain applicable, the provisions of this Section 2 shall not (i)
restrict Vertex or its Affiliates from entering into or performing its
obligations under any Bona Fide Collaboration Agreements and Assay
Development Collaboration Agreements; (ii) limit the rights of Vertex and its
Affiliates to Supply DNA Products to any unaffiliated third party who is a

         (d) If Vertex or any of its affiliates shall transfer, assign, sell
or otherwise convey any third party (the "Transferee") any interest in any
intellectual property right associated with the Business and licensed to or
retained by Vertex or any of its Affiliates under the Asset Purchase
Agreement or any of its Ancillary Agreements, Vertex or its applicable
Affiliate shall require that such Transferee shall restrict its use of such
intellectual property rights so as to comply with all of the obligations set
forth in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) herein.

         (e) If a court of competent jurisdiction shall declare any provision
or restriction contained in this Agreement unenforceable or void, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and
effect, and Vertex and Invitrogen hereby authorize and empower such court to
treat any such unenforceable provision as having been modified, but only to
the minimum extent deemed necessary by the court to render it enforceable and
for the court to enforce it fully to such extent.

         (f) Vertex expressly acknowledges that any material breach of this
Section 2 by or on behalf of Vertex or any Vertex Party shall be presumed to
result in irreparable harm to Invitrogen and that the remedy at law shall be
presumed to be inadequate and that upon any such material breach, Invitrogen
shall be presumed to be entitled (without the need for posting any bond or
other security) to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction,
in equity or otherwise, and to enforce the specific performance of Vertex or
such Vertex Parties' obligations under these provisions, which presumptions
shall be required to be rebutted by Vertex. The


                                      -5-

<PAGE>

rights conferred upon Invitrogen by the preceding sentence shall not be
exclusive of, but shall be in addition to, any other rights or remedies which
Invitrogen may have at law, in equity or otherwise.

         (g) Vertex recognizes that Vertex and its Affiliates have become
familiar with the Proprietary Assets of the Business that are being conveyed
and assigned to Invitrogen pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Vertex
further recognizes that the scope of the Business is independent of location
(such that it is not practical to limit the restrictions contained in this
Section 2 to a specified county, city, state, country, continent or part
thereof), and that, accordingly, the restrictions contained in this Section 2
are reasonable in all respects and necessary to protect the goodwill and
Proprietary Assets of Invitrogen and that, without such protection,
Invitrogen's customer and client relations and competitive advantage would be
materially adversely affected. It is specifically recognized by Vertex that
Invitrogen would not enter this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement
without the restrictions contained in this Section 2. Vertex acknowledges
that the restrictions contained in this Section 2 do not impose an undue
hardship on Vertex or any of the Vertex Parties and that Vertex and the
Seller have received adequate consideration in respect thereof.

         (h) Other than the restrictions set forth in Sections 2(a) and
2(b)(ii) which shall remain applicable, nothing in this Section 2 shall limit
the right of Vertex and its Affiliates to acquire any business through a
merger, consolidation, purchase of stock or assets, or otherwise, and to
operate any such acquired business thereafter if the annual consolidated
gross revenue of such acquired business attributable to activities otherwise
prohibited by this Agreement does not exceed 20% of the annual consolidated
gross revenues of such acquired business as a whole, as demonstrated by
reference to the most recently available financial statements of such
acquired business as of the time of the consummation of the acquisition
thereof by the applicable Vertex Party; PROVIDED that Vertex or its Affiliate
that acquired such business shall in good faith use its commercially
reasonable efforts to divest to a non-Affiliate, through sale or other
similar transaction, the portion of the acquired business the operation of
which is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement as soon as possible, but in
no event later than two (2) years following the acquisition of such business
(even if such two (2) year period concludes after the expiration of the
Restricted Period).

         (i) Other than the restrictions set forth in Sections 2(a) and
2(b)(ii) which shall remain applicable, nothing in this Section 2 shall apply
to a Controlling Affiliate of Vertex or to any Affiliates of the Controlling
Affiliate (other than the Owner and the Owner's direct and indirect
subsidiaries at the time such Controlling Affiliate becomes an Affiliate).

     SECTION 3. NOTICES. All notices and other communications provided for
under this Agreement will be in English in writing, shall expressly reference
the section(s) of this Agreement to which they pertain, and shall be
delivered to the other party, effective upon receipt, and in each case will
be addressed to the parties at the following addresses or to such other
addresses as may be designated by the parties from time to time during the
