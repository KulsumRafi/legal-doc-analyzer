                           CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT

         THIS AGREEMENT, is between Developers Diversified Realty Corporation,
an Ohio corporation (the "Employer"), and Timothy J. Bruce (the "Executive")
made this 15th day of November, 2002.

                                    RECITALS

         A. Executive is presently employed by Employer as a Senior Vice
President of Development;

         B. Employer wishes to induce Executive to continue as a Senior Vice
President of Development and, accordingly, to provide certain employment
security to Executive in the event of a "Change in Control" (as hereinafter
defined);

         C. Employer believes that it is in the best interest of its
shareholders for Executive to continue in his position on an objective and
impartial basis and without distraction or conflict of interest as a result of a
possible or actual Change in Control; and

         D. In consideration of this Agreement Executive is willing to continue
as Employer's Senior Vice President of Development.

         NOW THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF EXECUTIVE CONTINUING AS THE SENIOR
VICE PRESIDENT OF DEVELOPMENT OF EMPLOYER AND OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES HEREIN
CONTAINED, EXECUTIVE AND EMPLOYER, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, HEREBY AGREE

                                   DEFINITIONS

         1. A "Change in Control" for the purpose of this Agreement will be
deemed to have occurred if, at any time:

            (a) Any person or group of persons acting alone or together with any
of its affiliates or associates, acquires legal or beneficial ownership
interest, or voting rights, in twenty percent (20%) or more of the common voting
stock of Employer;

            (b) At any time during a period of 24 consecutive months,
individuals who were directors at the beginning of the period no longer
constitute a majority of the members of the Board of Directors unless the
election, or the nomination for election by Employer's shareholders, of each
director who was not a director at the beginning of the period is approved by at
least a majority of the directors who are in office at the time of the election
or nomination and were directors at the beginning of the period; or

            (c) A record date is established for determining shareholders of
Employer entitled to vote upon (i) a merger or consolidation of Employer with
another real estate investment trust, partnership, corporation or other entity
in which Employer is not the surviving or continuing entity or in which all or a
substantial part of the outstanding shares are to be converted into or exchanged
for cash, securities, or other property, (ii) a sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of Employer or (iii) the dissolution of
Employer.

         2. A "Triggering Event" for the purpose of this Agreement will be
deemed to have occurred if:

            (a) Within two years from the date on which the Change in Control
occurred, Employer terminates the employment of Executive, other than in the
case of a Termination For Cause, as herein defined;

            (b) Within two years from the date on which the Change in Control
occurred, Employer reduces Executive's title, responsibilities, power or
authority in comparison with his title, responsibilities, power or authority at
the time of the Change in Control;

            (c) Within two years from the date on which the Change in Control
occurred, Employer assigns Executive duties which are inconsistent with the
duties assigned to Executive on the date on which the Change in Control occurred
and which duties Employer persists in assigning to Executive despite the prior
written objection of Executive;

            (d) Within two years from the date on which the Change in Control
occurred, Employer reduces Executive's base compensation, his group health,
life, disability or other insurance programs (including any such benefits
provided to Executive's family), his pension, retirement or profit-sharing
benefits or any benefits provided by Employer's Equity-Based Award Plan, or any
substitute therefor, or excludes him from any plan, program or arrangement in
which the other executive officers of Employer are included; or

            (e) Within two years from the date on which the Change in Control
occurred, Employer requires Executive to be based at or generally work from any
location more than fifty miles from the geographical center of Cleveland, Ohio.

         3. A "Termination For Cause" for the purposes of this Agreement will be
deemed to have occurred if, and only if, Executive has committed a felony under
the laws of the United States of America, or of any state or territory thereof,
and has been convicted of that felony, or has pled guilty or nolo contendere
with respect to that felony, and the commission of that felony resulted in, or
was intended to result in, a loss (monetary or otherwise) to Employer or its
clients, customers, directors, officers or employees.

         4. "Executive's Annual Bonus" means Executive's annual bonus at the
time of a Triggering Event calculated on the basis of the maximum bonus
available to Executive and the assumption that all performance goals have been
or will be achieved by Employer in the year in which the Triggering Event
occurred.

         5. "Executive's Annual Salary" means Executive's annual base salary at
the time of a Triggering Event.

         This Agreement will not in any way constitute an employment agreement
between Employer and Executive and it will not oblige Executive to continue in
the employ of Employer, nor will it oblige Employer to continue to employ
Executive, but it will merely require Employer to pay severance benefits to

(as determined by the Board of Directors of Employer in its sole discretion and
reflected in the minutes of Board of Directors after notice to such Employee) of
Employer prior to a Change in Control of Employer.
