<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>12.      The execution and delivery by FOXY of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of
FOXY's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or constitute default or give rise to right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
known mortgage, indenture, license agreement or obligation or violate any court order, writ,
injunction or decree applicable to FOXY or any of its properties or assets of which such counsel
has knowledge after making inquiry of the principal executive officers with respect thereto;

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>13. Based solely on a review of the Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, corporate minutes and
stock record books of FOXY, (i) the authorized capital stock of FOXY is as set forth in Article
5.02, and the shares of FOXY Common Stock referred to in Article 5.02 constitute all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of FOXY; (ii) the outstanding shares of FOXY
Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to any

<p>14. This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered and constitutes
the legal and binding obligation of FOXY except as limited by bankruptcy and insolvency laws

<p>15. Such counsel does not know of any suit, action, arbitration, or legal, administrative or other

<p>16. The issuance of the FOXY shares to be issued to the Shareholders of  PRIMEPLAYER as
provided for herein shall be exempt from state and federal securities registration.  In this regard,
PRIMEPLAYER agrees to cooperate and assist counsel in submitting and receiving back the
necessary purchaser suitability questionnaires and other offeree materials necessary to establish
that FOXY shall have an exemption from state and federal registration for the issuance of the
shares subject of this Agreement.  In the event that Rule 506 of Regulation D of the General
Rules and Regulations of the Commission is not an available exemption for FOXY's issuance of
its shares to the Shareholders of  PRIMEPLAYER upon Closing,  PRIMEPLAYER agrees to
further cooperate in providing counsel with the necessary factual and other information
concerning  PRIMEPLAYER's shareholders and their relationship to it, its principals and each
other as necessary to enable counsel to issue a closing opinion that the issuance of the FOXY
shares to the Shareholders of  PRIMEPLAYER, as provided for in this Plan and Agreement, is a
Atransaction not involving any public offering" under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
(the <strong>A33 Act"</strong>) and the Blue Sky Laws of the various states in which certain  PRIMEPLAYER
Shareholders reside.
