<P>benefit plans which the Parent may from time to time have in
                  effect for all or most of its senior executives.  Such participation shall be subject to the

                  law and the discretion of the Parent Board, the Parent Compensation Committee or any
                  administrative or other committee provided for in or contemplated by any such plan, provided

                  the Executive vis a vis the other participants in such plan.  Nothing contained in this
                  Agreement shall be construed to create any obligation on the part of Parent or the Employer to
                  establish any such plan or to maintain the effectiveness of any such plan which may be in
                  effect from time to time.  Executive shall be entitled to the additional benefits identified in

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, level of
                  benefits or otherwise (but not the actual accrual of benefits) under any employee benefit plan,
                  program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent (other than any defined benefit
                  pension plan) following the Effective Date for the benefit of Employer's employees, such plan,
                  program or arrangement shall credit the Executive for service on or prior to the Effective Date
                  that was recognized by the Employer, for purposes of employee benefit plans, programs or
                  arrangements maintained by the Employer.  In addition, with respect to any welfare benefit plan
                  (as defined in Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended)
                  established or maintained by Parent following the Effective Date of this Agreement for the
                  benefit of Employer's employees, such plan shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions
                  with respect to the Executive to which he would not have been subject had he participated or
                  continued to participate in the medical plan of the Employer and provide that any covered
                  expenses incurred on or before the Effective Date by the Executive or by his covered dependent
                  shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and

         tax reports with respect to payments and benefits under this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably
         and in good faith believes that it is required to make such deductions, withholdings and tax reports.
         Payments under this Agreement shall be in amounts net of any such deductions or withholdings.  Nothing
         in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Employer to make any payments to compensate the
         Executive for any adverse tax effect associated with any payments or benefits or for any deduction or
         withholding from any payment or benefit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Vacation</u>.  The Executive shall be entitled to eleven (11) weeks of compensated vacation annually (i.e.,

         the obligation of Parent to pay the Executive his pro rata share of the Additional Payment (the
         "Additional Payment") required under Section 1.8 of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms
         therein and herein, then Parent agrees to pay the Executive his pro rata share of the Additional Payment
         upon the consummation of any such transaction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Exclusivity of Salary and Benefits</u>.  The Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation or benefits
         in consideration of his performance of services under this Agreement, other than those provided under

7(d) and serving or continuing to serve on boards of directors of such companies or other entities, in such
manner as shall not adversely affect the performance of Executive's duties pursuant to this Agreement; (b)

Termination Benefits Period and shall respond promptly to any reasonable
inquiries concerning any employment or self-employment in which the Executive
engages during the Termination Benefits Period. The pro rated bonus payment, if

affect the Executive vis a vis the other participants in the IC Plan) or by the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <u>Confidentiality</u>.  The Executive understands and agrees that the Executive's employment creates a
         relationship of confidence and trust between the Executive, the Employer and the Parent with respect to
         all Confidential Information.  At all times, both during the Executive's employment with the Employer
         and after its termination, the Executive will keep in confidence and trust all such Confidential
         Information, and will not use or disclose any such Confidential Information without the written consent
         of the Employer, except as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing the Executive's duties
         to the Employer or the Parent.  Notwithstanding anything heretofore stated in this Section 7,
         Executive's obligations under this Section 7 shall not, after termination or expiration of this
         Agreement, apply to (x) general know-how, (y) construction methods, processes and concepts developed by
         the Employer prior to the Effective Date, and (z) Executive's general knowledge and experience
         pertaining to the construction business.</P>

         employment will be and remain the sole property of the Employer or the Parent, as the case may be.  The
         Executive will return to the Employer or the Parent all such materials and property as and when
         requested by the Employer or the Parent.  In any event, the Executive will return all such materials and
         property immediately upon termination of the Executive's employment for any reason.  The Executive will
         not retain with the Executive any such material or property or any copies thereof after such termination.</P>

         termination of Executive's employment hereunder pursuant to Sections 6(c), 6(d) or 6(f),  he will not,
         without the prior written consent of the Employer, directly or indirectly, within the State of Florida,

         employee, agent or consultant, or in any other capacity), any business, organization or person other
         than the Employer or the Parent (or any affiliate of the Employer or Parent), and including any such

         business, activities, products or services conducted or offered by the Employer or Parent or any

         to prohibit (a) hiring or engaging or attempting to hire or engage for or on behalf of himself or any

         Employer or Parent) and (d) diverting to any Person any client or business opportunity of the Employer
         or the Parent (or any affiliate of the Employer or Parent).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
         contrary, such Stockholder may make passive investments in any competitive enterprise if such investment
         constitutes less than 5% of the equity of such enterprise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Third-Party Agreements and Rights.</u>  The Executive hereby confirms that the Executive is not bound by the
         terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party which restricts in any way the
         Executive's use or disclosure of information or the Executive's engagement in any business.  The
         Executive represents to the Employer that the Executive's execution of this Agreement, the Executive's
         employment with the Employer and the performance of the Executive's proposed duties for the Employer
         will not violate any obligations the Executive may have to any such previous employer or other party.
         In the Executive's work for the Employer, the Executive will not disclose or make use of any information
         in violation of any agreements with or rights of any such previous employer or other party, and the
         Executive will not bring to the premises of the Employer any copies or other tangible embodiments of
         non-public information belonging to or obtained from any such previous employment or other party.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Litigation and Regulatory Cooperation.</u>  During and after the Executive's employment, the Executive shall
         cooperate fully with the Employer and the Parent in the defense or prosecution of any claims or actions
         now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Employer or the
         Parent which relate to events or occurrences that transpired while the Executive was employed by the
         Employer.  The Executive's full cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but
         not be limited to, being available to meet with counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to act as
         a witness on behalf of the Employer or the Parent at mutually convenient times.  During and after the
         Executive's employment, the Executive also shall cooperate fully with the Employer and the Parent in
         connection with any investigation or review of any federal, state or local regulatory authority as any
         such investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired while the Executive was
         employed by the Employer.  The Employer or the Parent shall reimburse to Executive for any out-of-pocket
         expenses incurred in connection with the Executive's performance of obligations pursuant to this Section
         7(f).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Injunction</u>.  The Executive agrees that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to the
          Employer and the Parent which might result from any breach by the Executive of the promises set forth in
         this Section 7, and that in any event money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such breach.
         Accordingly, subject to Section 8 of this Agreement, the Executive agrees that if the Executive
         breaches, or proposes to breach, any portion of this Agreement, the Employer and the Parent shall be
         entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have, to an injunction or other appropriate
         equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the
         Employer or the Parent.</P>

breach thereof or otherwise arising out of the Executive's employment or the termination of that employment
(including, without limitation, any claims of unlawful employment discrimination whether based on age or
otherwise) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be settled by arbitration in accordance with the

Executive).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       <u>Consent to Jurisdiction.</u>  To the extent that any court action is permitted consistent with or to enforce
this Agreement, the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit
in and for Broward County, Florida, and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Accordingly, with respect to any such court action, the Executive, Employer and Parent (a) each submits to the
personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to service of process; and (c) waives any other requirement
(whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction or service of
process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Integration.</u>  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements between the parties with respect to any related subject
matter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Assignment; Successors and Assigns, etc.</u>  None of the parties may make any assignment of this Agreement

into any other corporation, partnership, organization or other entity, or transfer all or substantially all of
its properties or assets to any other corporation, partnership, organization or other entity.  This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Employer, the Parent and the Executive, their respective

portion or provision of any section of this Agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable
by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or
provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be
affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Waiver.</u>  No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the
waiving party.  The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement,
or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such
term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Notices.</u>  Any notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <u>Amendment.</u>  This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by the

offices of the Employer, which are currently located in Broward County, Florida, subject to reasonable travel
requirements during the course of such performance.  Executive's duties require travel between the principal
