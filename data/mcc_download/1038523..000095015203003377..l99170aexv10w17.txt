         defined in Section 5.1 hereof), for Cause (as such term is defined in
         Section 5.3 hereof) or for any other reason, and the Employee shall
         have the right to resign or to terminate his employment hereunder

                  salary or other amounts payable under this Agreement to or for
                  the benefit of the Employee, shall terminate upon the
                  effective date of such resignation, and the Employee shall not
                  be entitled to any compensation under this Agreement except
                  for Base Salary accrued and unpaid through, and any vested
                  benefits under any awards to the Employee pursuant to the
                  Stock Incentive Plans, or any amount payable under any other
                  benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate in accordance
                  with the terms of such plan, as of the effective date of such
                  resignation. The Employee agrees to give the Company one
                  hundred twenty (120) days written notice of his resignation
                  (other than for Good Reason and except for Scheduled
                  Retirement)."

         4. The following shall be inserted as Section 5.2.1 of the Employment
Agreement:

                  "5.2.1 TERMINATION DUE TO SCHEDULED RETIREMENT. If the
                  Employee's employment with the Company hereunder is terminated
                  during the Term because of the Employee's Scheduled Retirement
                  (as Scheduled Retirement is defined in Section 5.2.2 hereof),
                  all obligations of the Company and Holdings, including,
                  without limitation, the obligation to pay salary or other
                  amounts payable under this Agreement to or for the benefit of
                  the Employee, shall terminate upon the date of such Scheduled
                  Retirement, and the Employee shall not be entitled to any
                  compensation under this Agreement except for (i) Base Salary
                  accrued and unpaid through the date of such Scheduled
                  Retirement, (ii) an amount equal to the product of (x) the
                  Annual Bonus, if any, determined by the Compensation Committee
                  for the year in which the Scheduled Retirement occurs,
                  MULTIPLIED BY (y) the fraction, the numerator of which equals
                  the number of days the Employee was employed by the Company
                  during the Fiscal Year in which such Scheduled Retirement
                  occurs and the denominator of which is three hundred
                  sixty-five (365); and (iii) any vested benefits under any
                  awards to the Employee pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plans,
                  or any amount payable under any other benefit plan of the
                  Company or any Affiliate or any other agreement between the
                  Employee and the Company or any Affiliate, in accordance with
                  the terms of such plan or agreement as of the date of such
                  Scheduled Retirement. The Employee agrees to give the Company
                  six (6) months' written notice of his Scheduled Retirement.

                  Upon the Employee's Scheduled Retirement, Holdings and the
                  Company shall offer the Employee the position of Chairman,
                  Non-Executive, in which position the Employee would commence
                  service immediately after the Scheduled Retirement date at an
                  annual salary of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
                  ($250,000), with such duties and in accordance with such other
                  terms contained in any supplemental or substitute agreement
                  hereto as to which Holdings, the Company and the Employee may
                  agree; provided that the Employee's refusal of any such offer
                  shall in no way adversely affect his entitlement to any
                  benefit to which he would otherwise have been entitled
                  hereunder or under any other plan or agreement in the event of
                  his Scheduled Retirement, but the Employee shall not be
                  entitled to further vesting under any Stock Incentive Plan if
                  Employee's service does not continue after his Scheduled
                  Retirement.

                  Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Holdings on a date
                  selected by the Employee, which date shall be no earlier than
                  June 30, 2004. In order for such termination to be deemed a

                  in writing of such Scheduled Retirement at least six (6)
                  months in advance of the date selected by the Employee to be
                  the date of his Scheduled Retirement including a Scheduled
                  Retirement date of June 30, 2004. The term `Scheduled
                  Retirement' shall be deemed to include a termination of the
                  Employee's employment as President and Chief Executive Officer
                  of the Company and Holdings following which he remains an
                  Employee of the Company, Holdings or an affiliated company
                  pursuant to an arrangement approved by the Board. A Scheduled
                  Retirement shall not be deemed to be a voluntary resignation
                  without Good Reason nor a discharge of any type."

                                respect to any portion of the Performance Option
                                that becomes exercisable following such
                                Termination of Employment pursuant to Section
                                3.1(c), such exercisable portion of the

                       (ii) BY COMPANY FOR CAUSE. All exercisable and
                            unexercisable portions of the Option held by the

                            Termination of Employment."

         11. The footnote to Schedule 1 to the Option Agreement shall be deleted
in its entirety, and the following shall be inserted therefor:

         "*   The number of Option Shares specified above is subject to
              adjustment (increase but not decrease) in the event the Optionee
              receives an allocation of shares from the discretionary option
              pool established by the Board of Directors as of January 1, 2001,
              and deemed granted as of the Grant Date specified herein. Such
              discretionary option pool shares shall be allocated annually
              (beginning in 2001) in equal installments over a period of five
              years. Any such allocation to the Optionee shall represent a pro
              rata portion of the discretionary pool shares that are allocated
              to new Optionees added to the Plan as participants after January
              1, 2001 with respect to a particular year following allocations
              for that year to such new Optionees (as a ratio of (A) one-fifth
              of the total number of Option Shares granted to the Optionee to
              (B) one-fifth of the total number of shares subject to the
              options, in each case not including the discretionary pool
              shares). Allocations from the discretionary pool shall be made
              pursuant to procedures established by the Committee.

              Pursuant to Article III of this Agreement, the number of Option
              Shares specified above also is subject to decrease and forfeiture
              in the event the Optionee experiences a Change in Status prior to
              the expiration of the Option. Any Option Shares so forfeited shall
              be added to the discretionary pool for allocation.

              In the event the Optionee's Scheduled Retirement occurs before all
              of the discretionary pool shares have been allocated as described
              above (i.e., prior to the end of the five-year period), Optionee
              shall be entitled to a pro



                                       7

              rata allocation for the calendar year in which his Scheduled
              Retirement occurs, which shall be equal to the product of (x) the
              number of discretionary pool shares to which the Optionee would
              have been entitled, but for his Scheduled Retirement, for the year
              in which the Scheduled Retirement occurs, MULTIPLIED BY (y) the
              fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of complete
              months the Employee was employed by the Company during the
              calendar year in which such Scheduled Retirement occurs and the
              denominator of which is 12."

                PART III -- MANAGEMENT EQUITY ROLLOVER AGREEMENT

         Part III of this Amendment shall amend the terms of the Management
Equity Rollover Agreement as set forth herein. Capitalized terms used in this
Part III not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Management Equity Rollover Agreement.

         12. Section 4.2 of the Management Equity Rollover Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety, and the following shall be inserted therefor:

                  "4.2 REQUIRED REPURCHASE - SCHEDULED RETIREMENT. In the event
                  of a Termination by reason of Management Employee's Scheduled
                  Retirement, Management Employee shall have the right to put to
                  the Company upon 60, but not more than 90, days' advance
                  written notice, and if Management Employee exercises such
                  right, the Company shall be required to purchase from
                  Management Employee, all or any part of the TravelCenters
                  Common Stock and equity interests held by Management Employee
                  as follows:

                           (a) commencing on the date of such Scheduled
                           Retirement, the shares of TravelCenters Common Stock
                           held by Management Employee at the Fair Market Value
                           therefor;

                           by Management Employee at the Fair Market Value of
                           the TravelCenters Common Stock underlying such equity
                           interests, minus the exercise price therefor;

                           (c) commencing on the date which is eighteen months
                           after the date of such Scheduled Retirement, all
                           remaining exercisable TravelCenters equity interests
                           held by Management Employee at the Fair Market Value
                           of the TravelCenters Common Stock underlying such
                           equity interests, minus the exercise price therefor;

                  deemed to be its Fair Market Value (i) if the put right is
                  exercised with proper notice as of the date of Management
                  Employee's Scheduled Retirement or the date which is six
                  months or eighteen months thereafter, the Fair Market Value on

                  his put right; or (ii) if the put right is exercised with
                  proper notice as of any other date, the Fair Market Value on
                  the last day of the fiscal quarter during which Management
                  Employee provided notice of the exercise of his put right. The
                  foregoing put right may be exercised by Management Employee
                  not more than two times per calendar year and is intended,
                  notwithstanding the language of Section 5.1 of the Stock
                  Option Agreement, dated December 26, 2001, between
                  TravelCenters of America, Inc. and Management Employee, to be
                  in lieu of and to supersede the Company's obligation to
                  repurchase options contained in such Section 5.1. The
                  foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2 to the contrary
                  notwithstanding, if there is a Change of Control which
                  involves the sale by stockholders of the Company other than
                  Management Employee of shares of TravelCenters Common Stock
                  (or the receipt of cash or other property in connection with
                  Change of Control in respect of such shares of TravelCenters
                  Common Stock), the Company shall be required upon the
                  consummation of the transaction which gives rise to the Change
                  of Control to purchase (or cause the purchase of) all
                  remaining shares of TravelCenters Common Stock and
                  TravelCenters equity interests held by Management Employee, at
                  a price per share equal to the price per share paid to such
                  stockholders pursuant to the Change of Control, minus any
                  exercise price, as the case may be."

         13. Section 4.3 of the Management Equity Rollover Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety, and the following shall be inserted therefor:

                           "4.3 CLOSING OF PURCHASE. The closing of any purchase
                  pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2 shall take place at the

                  the put right is exercised, or (b) the date of the Change of
                  Control, as the case may be."

         14. Section 4.6(a) of the Management Equity Rollover Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety, and the following substituted therefor:

                  "(a) At any time the Company elects or is required to purchase

                  Company's delivery of a bank cashier's check or certified
                  check for the remainder of such purchase price, if any;
                  provided that in lieu of paying cash, the Company may pay the
                  purchase price for any purchases of shares pursuant to Section
                  4.4 (other than a purchase in connection with a Scheduled

         15. Section 4.7(a) of the Management Equity Rollover Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety, and the following substituted therefor:

                  `Change of Control,' `Disability,' `Good Reason' and

                  in the Stock Option Agreement between Management Employee and
                  TravelCenters, dated the Closing Date, as it may be amended
                  from time to time, entered into pursuant to the TravelCenters
                  of America, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan; in addition, the

                            PART IV -- MISCELLANEOUS

         16. ALTERNATIVE SATISFACTION OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS. In the event
that this Amendment provides for any payment or benefit to the Employee in Part
I, II or III hereof which cannot be provided because this Amendment conflicts
with or contradicts another provision in any other plan or agreement or because
the Amendment is deemed not to have amended the provisions of the agreement
which it purports to amend, Holdings or the Company shall provide the Employee
with an "Alternative Benefit" in lieu thereof. The Alternative Benefit is a
benefit or payment which places the Employee in at least as good of an economic
position as if the payment or benefit promised by this Amendment (a) were
provided exactly as called for by this Amendment and (b) had the favorable
economic, tax and legal characteristics customary for plans, policies or
arrangements of that type.
