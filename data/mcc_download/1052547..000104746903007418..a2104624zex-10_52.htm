<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Stock Option Agreement, the Company has granted you an option to purchase the number of shares of the Company's common stock
("Common Stock") indicated in the Grant Notice at the exercise price indicated in the Grant Notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
option is granted in connection with and in furtherance of the Company's 2002 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") for the Company's employees (including officers), directors or
consultants. Defined terms not explicitly defined in this Stock Option Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
details of your option are as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>VESTING.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Subject to the limitations contained herein, your option will vest as provided in the Grant Notice, provided that
vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting
date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the options and the rights and benefits under this Stock Option Agreement. Employment or service, even if substantial, for only a
portion of a vesting period will not entitle you to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or service as
provided herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>METHOD OF PAYMENT.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Payment of the exercise price by cash or check is due in full upon exercise of all or any part of your
option. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>WHOLE SHARES; RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SHARES.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Your option may only be exercised for whole shares. You will have no rights
or privileges of a stockholder of the Company as to any shares underlying the option until the issuance and delivery of a certificate evidencing the shares registered in
your name following the exercise of the option. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as to a stockholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, your option may not be exercised
unless the shares issuable upon exercise of your option are then registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or, if such shares are not then so registered, the
Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>TERM.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Subject to Section&nbsp;10 of the Plan, the term of your option commences on the Date of Grant and expires upon

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>OPTION NOT A SERVICE CONTRACT.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Your option is not an employment contract and nothing in your option shall be deemed to
create in any way whatsoever any obligation on your part to continue in the employ of the Company or one of its Affiliates, or of the Company and its Affiliates to continue your employment with the
Company or any of its Affiliates. In addition, nothing in your option shall obligate the Company, any Affiliate, and their respective shareholders, board of directors, officers or employees to

SIZE=2><B>GOVERNING PLAN DOCUMENT.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Your option is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are hereby
made a part of your option, including without limitation the provisions of the Plan relating to option provisions, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations
which may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of your option and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall
control. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Stock Option Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board (or a committee thereof) do not (and shall not be
deemed to) create any additional rights for you not expressly set forth in this Stock Option Agreement. </FONT></P>
