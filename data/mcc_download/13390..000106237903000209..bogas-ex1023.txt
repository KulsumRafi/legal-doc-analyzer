                        (For Use Under Rate Schedule FS)

     This Contract is made as of the 1st day of September,  1993, by and between
TENNESSEE  GAS  PIPELINE   COMPANY,   a  Delaware   corporation   herein  called
"Transporter,"  and BOSTON GAS CO, a  MASSACHUSETTS  Corporation,  herein called
"Shipper."  Transporter and Shipper  collectively shall be referred to herein as
the "Parties."

                          ARTICLE I - SCOPE OF CONTRACT

Following the commencement of service hereunder, in accordance with the terms of
Transporter's Rate Schedule FS, and of this Agreement, Transporter shall receive
for  injection  for  Shipper's  account a daily  quantity of gas up to Shipper's
Maximum  Injection  Quantity  of 36,043  dekatherms  (Dth) and  Maximum  Storage
Quantity  (MSQ) of 5,406,507  (Dth) (on a cumulative  basis) and on demand shall
withdraw from Shipper's  storage account and deliver to Shipper a daily quantity
of gas up to Shipper's  Maximum Daily Withdrawal  Quantity (MDWQ) of 41,687 Dth;
provided  however,  that when Shipper's storage balance is equal to or less than
30% of the MSQ but greater  than 20% of the MSQ,  the Maximum  Daily  Withdrawal
Quantity shall be 41,687 Dth; and provided further,  that when Shipper's storage
balance is less than or equal to 20% of the MSQ,  the Maximum  Daily  Withdrawal
Quantity  shall be 41,687 Dth. For demand charge  purposes,  the 41,687 MDWQ for
balances greater than 30% of the MSQ shall be used.

                           ARTICLE II - SERVICE POINT

The  point  or  points  at  which  the gas is to be  tendered  for  delivery  by
Transporter to Shipper under this Contract shall be at the storage service point
at Transporter's Compressor Station 313.

                               ARTICLE III - PRICE

1.   Shipper  agrees to pay  Transporter  for all natural  gas  storage  service
     furnished to Shipper hereunder,  including compensation for system fuel and
     losses,  at  Transporter's  legally  effective  rate  or at  any  effective
     superseding  rate  applicable  to the  type of  service  specified  herein.
     Transporter's  present legally effective rate for said service is contained
     in  Transporter's  FERC Tariff as filed with the Federal Energy  Regulatory
     Commission. Except as provided to the contrary in any written or electronic
     agreement(s)  between  Transporter  and  Shipper in effect  during the term
     Agreement, Shipper shall pay Transporter the applicable maximum rate(s) and
     all other  applicable  charges and  surcharges  specified in the Summary of
     Rates  in  Transporter's  FERC  Gas  Tariff  and  in  this  Rate  Schedule.
     Transporter  and  Shipper  may agree that a specific  discounted  rate will
     apply only to certain volumes under the agreement.  Transporter and Shipper
     may agree that a  specified  discounted  rate will apply only to  specified
     volumes  (MSQ,  MDIQ,  MDWQ,  or  Authorized  Overrun  volumes)  under  the
     Agreement;  that a specified  discounted  rate will apply only if specified
     volumes are achieved  (with the maximum  rates  applicable to volumes above
     the specified  volumes or to all volumes if the specified volumes are never
     achieved);  that  a  specified  discounted  rate  will  apply  only  during
     specified  periods  of the year or over a  specifically  defined  period of
     time; that a specified discounted rate will apply only to specified storage
     points;  and/or  that a  specified  discounted  rate  will  apply  only  to
     production or reserves  committed or dedicated to Transporter.  Transporter
     and  Shipper  may agree to a  specified  discounted  rate  pursuant  to the
     provisions of this Section 3.1 provided that the discounted rate is between
     the applicable maximum and minimum rates for this service.

2.   Shipper  agrees to reimburse  Transporter  for any filing or similar  fees,
     which have not been previously paid by Shipper, which Transporter incurs in
     rendering service hereunder.

3.   Shipper agrees that  Transporter  shall have the  unilateral  right to file
     with the appropriate regulatory authority and make changes effective in (a)
     the rates and charges  applicable to service pursuant to Transporter's Rate
     Schedule FS, (b) the rate schedule(s)  pursuant to which service  hereunder
     is  rendered,  or (c) any  provision  of the General  Terms and  Conditions



<PAGE>

     applicable  to those rate  schedules.  Transporter  agrees that Shipper may
     protest or contest the  aforementioned  filings,  or may seek authorization
     from  duly  constituted  regulatory  authorities  for  such  adjustment  of
     Transporter's  existing FERC Gas Tariff as may be found necessary to assure
     Transporter just and reasonable rates.

        ARTICLE IV - INCORPORATION OF RATE SCHEDULE AND TARIFF PROVISIONS

This agreement shall be subject to the terms of Transporter's  Rate Schedule FS,
as filed  with the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  together  with the
General Terms and Conditions  applicable  thereto (including any changes in said
Rate Schedule or General Terms and  Conditions as may from time to time be filed
and made effective by Transporter).

                          ARTICLE V - TERM OF AGREEMENT

This contract shall be effective as of the 1 September, 1993 and shall remain in
force and effect  unless  modified  as per  Exhibit B, until 31  October,  2008,
("Primary Term") and on a month to month basis thereafter  unless  terminated by
either  Party upon at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to the other
Party; provided, however, that if the Primary Term is one year or more, then any
rights to Shipper's  extension of this Agreement after the Primary Term shall be
governed by Article III,  Section 10.4 of the General  Terms and  Conditions  of
Transporter's  FERC  Gas  Tariff;   provided  further,  if  the  FERC  or  other
governmental body having jurisdiction over the service rendered pursuant to this
Agreement authorizes abandonment of such service, this Agreement shall terminate
on the abandonment date permitted by the FERC or such other governmental body.

This Agreement will terminate upon notice from  Transporter in the event Shipper
fails to pay all of the amount of any bill for service  rendered by  Transporter
hereunder  in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions  of  Article VI of the
General Terms and Conditions of Transporters FERC Gas Tariff.
