2        THE REVOLVING FACILITY

2.1      THE REVOLVING FACILITY

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders
         shall make available to the Borrowers a revolving credit facility (the
         "REVOLVING

                                       26
<PAGE>

         FACILITY") of up to L75,000,000. The Revolving Facility (as described
         in clause 6 shall consist of Revolving Loans (to be denominated in
         sterling and/or, if agreed between the relevant Borrower and the Agent,
         dollars, euro or one or more other Foreign Currencies) to be made by
         the Lenders and, if specifically agreed by the Agent (on the
         instructions of the Issuer), Letters of Credit and/or Guarantees to be
         issued by the Issuer (subject to reimbursement by the relevant Borrower
         and each of the Lenders on the terms set out in this Agreement) and
         Swingline Loans (to be denominated in sterling and/or dollars, euros or
         such one or more other Foreign Currencies as may be agreed between the
         relevant Borrower and the Swingline Lender), to be made by the
         Swingline Lender (subject to reimbursement by the Lenders on the terms
         set out in this Agreement) in a maximum aggregate principal Original
         Sterling Amount not exceeding the Revolving Facility Amount.

2.2      PURPOSE

         The Revolving Facility is to be applied (i) to refinance the Existing
         Facilities and (ii) to meet each Borrower's general working capital
         purposes and each Borrower shall apply all amounts raised by it under
         this Agreement accordingly provided that none of the Agent, the
         Security Trustee or any of the Lenders shall be obliged to concern
         itself with the application of amounts raised by any Borrower under
         this Agreement.

2.3      OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL

         The obligations of each Lender under this Agreement are several. The
         failure by any Lender to perform its obligations under this Agreement
         shall not affect the obligations of any Obligor towards any other party
         to this Agreement nor shall any such other party be liable for the
         failure by such Lender to perform its obligations.

2.4      RIGHTS SEVERAL

         The rights of each Lender are several. The amount at any time owing by
         any Borrower to any party under this Agreement shall be a separate and
         independent debt from the amount owing to any other party.

2.5      FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

         None of the proceeds of any Utilisation of the Revolving Facility under
         this Agreement may be used in any way which infringes section 151
         Companies Act 1985 or any similar or other statutory obligation whether
         in the United Kingdom or elsewhere unless the provisions of sections
         155 to 158 thereof are actually complied with.

2.6      CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS

         The obligations of any party under or in respect of clauses 10, 11, 18,
         19, 20.7, 24 and 26.9 shall continue even after the date (the
         "DISCHARGE DATE") upon which the Total Commitments have been cancelled
         or otherwise reduced to zero and the Outstandings of all the Lenders
         have been permanently repaid or

                                       27
<PAGE>

         prepaid, to the extent of and in respect of any cost, expense, loss,
         liability or claim indemnifiable under any such clause and suffered or
         incurred by any Beneficiary on or prior to the Discharge Date.

         Company shall become an Unsecured Guarantor by giving to the Agent or,
         as applicable, to Ideal not less than 10 business days' notice. For the
         avoidance of doubt, any Additional Borrower shall, unless the Agent
         otherwise agrees, automatically be required also to become a Charging
         Company pursuant to clause 4, without the need for the Agent to serve a
         further notice in accordance with clause 4.

         3.2.1    if the Lenders approve or, as applicable, require the addition
                  of that Group Company as an Additional Borrower or, as
                  applicable, as an Unsecured Guarantor;

         3.2.2    upon Ideal delivering to the Agent a duly completed and
                  executed Accession Notice;

         3.2.3    in the case of a request to appoint an Additional Borrower, if
                  no Default has occurred or is likely to occur as a result of
                  that Group Company becoming an Additional Borrower;

         3.2.4    if the Agent has received all of the documents and other

                  Agent.

         For the avoidance of doubt, no Accounts or Inventory of any Group
         Company which is to become an Additional Borrower shall be considered
         as Eligible Accounts or Eligible Inventory, unless the Agent has
         completed a field examination and such other due diligence as the Agent
         may require and such Accounts and Inventory satisfy the applicable
         conditions set forth in this Agreement.

3.3      TIMING

         subject always to clauses 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and, in the case of a proposed
         Additional Borrower, clause 3.2.3, the

         applicable, an Unsecured Guarantor.

         Ideal as its agent for the purposes of the Finance Documents by its

         signed by Ideal as if it had been signed by any other Borrower or any
         Unsecured Guarantor. Ideal may give a good receipt for any sum payable
         by any Finance Party to any other Borrower or an Unsecured Guarantor.
         Any communication delivered to Ideal shall be deemed to have been
         delivered to each of the Borrowers and each Unsecured Guarantor. Any
         communication made by Ideal to the Agent or any other Finance Party
         shall, to the extent permissible by law, be deemed to have been made
         with the consent of each other Borrower and each Unsecured Guarantor.

         are required to be repeated pursuant to clause 14.2 are true and

         which has acceded to this Agreement as an Additional Borrower shall,

                  commissions, fees and charges due from the relevant Borrower

         advisers as shall have been agreed with the Agent and the Lenders as

         occasions, provided that the Agent may never exceed the Maximum
         Revolving Credit Line. If the Agent does exceed the limits of the

         which exceeds five (5) per cent. of the amount of the Maximum Revolving
         Credit Line and if it does exceed the limits of the Available Revolving
         Facility Amount on any occasion, the Agent shall not be deemed thereby

         Loans denominated in any currency shall be repaid on a daily basis by
         the transfer of the full credit balance on each Receivables Account to
         any loan account denominated in that currency maintained by each
         Borrower with the Agent as contemplated in clause 20.8 or otherwise on
         demand by the Swingline Lender, any such credit balance denominated in
         any particular currency to be applied first to the unpaid principal
         amount of Swingline Loans denominated in the same currency and
         thereafter in or towards repayment of the unpaid principal amount of
         any Swingline Loans denominated in any other currency, the manner and
         extent of such application to be at the Agent's discretion.

6.8.3    REFUNDING OF SWINGLINE LOANS BY THE LENDERS: The Agent will not less
         than weekly and may, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion or
         upon request of the Swingline Lender, on behalf of the Borrowers (each
         of which hereby irrevocably directs the Agent to act on its behalf in
         this respect), give notice to

                                       33
<PAGE>

         the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender) requiring that they make a
         Reference Rate Revolving Loan to the relevant Borrower in an amount
         equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans then
         outstanding together with all interest accrued thereon but unpaid.
         Interest on any such Reference Rate Revolving Loan shall be calculated
         and payable in accordance with the provisions of clause 7.2.2.

6.8.4    APPLICATION OF REFERENCE RATE REVOLVING LOANS: Regardless of whether
         the conditions in this Agreement for the making of Revolving Loans are
         then satisfied, each Lender shall make its share of any Reference Rate
         Revolving Loan referred to in clause 6.8.3 available to the Agent for
         the benefit of the Swingline Lender on the date notice of the
         requirement for any such Reference Rate Revolving Loan is given to the
         Lenders.

6.9      SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR ISSUE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES

         In addition to being subject to the satisfaction of the applicable
         conditions precedent referred to in clause 5, the obligation of the
         Issuer to issue any Letter of Credit or Guarantee is subject to the
         following conditions having been satisfied in a manner satisfactory to
         the Agent:

         6.9.1    the relevant Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent, at
                  such times and in such manner as the Agent may prescribe, an

                  thereof;

         6.9.2    the form and terms of the proposed Letter of Credit or
                  Guarantee shall be satisfactory to the Agent and the Issuer;
                  and

         6.9.3    as of the date of issue, no order of any court, arbitrator or
                  public authority shall purport by its terms to prohibit or
                  restrain the Issuer or banks generally from issuing letters of
                  credit or guarantees of the type and in the amount of the
                  proposed Letter of Credit or Guarantee (as the case may be),
                  and no law, rule or regulation applicable to the Issuer or
                  banks generally and no request or directive (whether or not
                  having the force of law) from any central bank or public
                  authority with jurisdiction over the Issuer or banks generally
                  shall prohibit, or request that the Issuer refrain from, the
                  issue of letters of credit or guarantees generally or the
                  issue of such Letter of Credit or Guarantee.

6.10     GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR ISSUE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES

6.10.1   REQUESTS FOR ISSUE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OR GUARANTEES: A Borrower shall
         give to the Agent four business days' prior written notice of that
         Borrower's request for the issue of any Letter of Credit or Guarantee.
         In the case of a Guarantee, such notice shall specify the maximum
         contingent liability to be guaranteed, the beneficiary in whose favour
         the Guarantee is to be issued, the effective date of issue of such
         Guarantee (which shall be a business day), details of the obligation in
         respect of which the contingent liability might arise

                                       34
<PAGE>

         and the date on which such obligation is due to mature or expire. In
         the case of a Letter of Credit, such notice shall specify the original
         face amount and currency denomination of the Letter of Credit
         requested, the effective date of issue of such Letter of Credit (which
         shall be a business day), whether such Letter of Credit may be drawn in
         a single or partial draws, the date on which such Letter of Credit is
         to expire and the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit.

6.10.2   NO EXTENSIONS OR AMENDMENT: The Issuer shall not be obliged to extend
         or amend or cause to be extended or amended any Letter of Credit or
         Guarantee it has issued.

6.10.3   EVENTS OF DEFAULT: The Issuer need not, before issuing a Letter of
         Credit or Guarantee, make any enquiry or otherwise concern itself as to
         whether any event has occurred which, under the terms hereof, would
         relieve the Issuer from its obligations to issue that Letter of Credit
         or Guarantee and accordingly none of the Borrowers nor any of the
         Lenders shall have any right to resist any claim under clause 6.12 nor
         otherwise on the ground that any such event had occurred before the
         issue of the Letter of Credit or Guarantee, provided that, before
         issuing a Letter of Credit or Guarantee, the Issuer shall inform each
         of the Lenders of any Event of Default of which it has actual notice.

6.11     COMPENSATION FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES

         Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of the Issuer
         with respect to each Letter of Credit or Guarantee, the Letter of
         Credit and Guarantee Fee and such other reasonable fees and other
         charges as are charged by the Issuer for letters of credit or
         guarantees issued by it including, without limitation its standard fees
         for issuing, administering, amending, renewing, paying and cancelling
         letters of credit and guarantees and all other fees associated with
         issuing or servicing letters of credit, as and when assessed, all as
         specified in clause 22.5.

6.12     PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES

6.12.1   DEMANDS UNDER A LETTER OF CREDIT OR GUARANTEE: If a demand for payment
         is made under a Letter of Credit or Guarantee on the Issuer, the Issuer
         shall promptly notify the Agent of such demand and pay the sum demanded
         in accordance with the terms of the relevant Letter of Credit or
         Guarantee, whereupon:

         (a)      the Agent shall not later than four hours after receipt of
                  such demand, if such demand is made prior to 1.00 pm (London
                  time) on any business day, or otherwise by 10.00 am (London
                  time) on the next succeeding business day, notify each Lender
                  of the amount of such demand and such Lender's proportion
                  thereof which such Lender shall be obliged to pay; and

         (b)      Lender shall on the date of such notification make its share
                  of the amount demanded available to the Agent for the benefit
                  of the Issuer in immediately available funds.

                                       35
<PAGE>

         If any Lender is unable to make its share of such amount available on
         such date, it shall nevertheless do so as soon as possible thereafter
         and in any event by no later than two business days after the date
         notice of such requirement was given to it by the Agent, together with
         interest thereon from the date of such notice to the date of payment at
         the rate specified by the Agent as representing the Issuer's cost of
         funds.

6.12.2   INDEMNITY: Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
         Issuer in sterling or sterling equivalent from and against all claims,
         demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
         (including reasonable legal fees) which the Issuer may incur or sustain
         as a consequence of the issue of any Letter of Credit or Guarantee or
         the performance of its obligations thereunder (save where the same are
         caused by the Issuer's gross negligence or wilful misconduct). This is
         a continuing indemnity, extends to the ultimate balance of each
         Borrower's obligations and liabilities under clause 6 and shall
         continue in force notwithstanding any intermediate payment in whole or
         in part of those obligations or liabilities.

6.12.3   PAYMENT OF LETTER OF CREDIT OR GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS: Without limiting
         or affecting any of the provisions of this clause 6.12, each Borrower
         agrees to reimburse the Agent and each Lender for any draw under any
         Letter of Credit or Guarantee immediately upon demand, and to pay the
         Agent the amount of all other obligations and other amounts payable to
         it under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or Guarantee
         immediately when due, irrespective of any claim, set-off, defence or
         other right which that Borrower may have at any time against the Agent,
         the Lenders, the Issuer or any other person.

6.12.4   REFERENCE RATE REVOLVING LOANS TO SATISFY REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS: If
         the Issuer honours a draw under any Letter of Credit or makes a payment
         under a Guarantee and the relevant Borrower shall not have repaid such
         amount to the Agent pursuant to clause 6.12.3, the honouring of such
         draw or the making of such payment by the Issuer shall of itself cause
         there to arise a Reference Rate Revolving Loan by the Lenders of the
         amount of such draw or payment which Reference Rate Revolving Loan that
         Borrower shall be obliged to repay immediately. In the event of
         non-payment of such Reference Rate Revolving Loan, interest thereon
         shall be calculated by reference to successive periods of such duration
         as the Agent may select at a rate per annum which is the sum of (i) two
         per cent (2%) (ii) the Applicable Margin and (iii) the Reference Rate
         and shall be paid by the relevant Borrower at the end of the period by
         reference to which it is calculated or on such other date as the Agent
         may specify by written notice to that Borrower. If not paid on the due
         date, the interest shall be added to and form part of the Reference
         Rate Revolving Loan on which interest shall accrue and be payable in
         accordance with the provisions of this clause 6.12.4.

6.13     LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES - ASSUMPTION OF RISK

6.13.1   AUTHORISATIONS: Each of the Borrowers and the Lenders unconditionally
         and irrevocably:

                                       36
<PAGE>

         (a)      authorise and direct the Issuer to pay any request or demand
                  for payment under and in accordance with any Letter of Credit
                  or Guarantee issued by it without requiring proof of the
                  relevant Borrower's agreement that any amount so demanded or
                  paid is or was due and notwithstanding that the relevant
                  Borrower may dispute the validity of any such request, demand
                  or payment;

         (b)      confirms that the Issuer deals in documents only and shall not
                  be concerned with the legality of any claim under any Letter
                  of Credit or Guarantee or any other underlying transaction or
                  any set-off, counterclaim or defence as between the relevant
                  Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or
                  Guarantee; and

         (c)      agrees that the Issuer need not have any regard to the
                  sufficiency, accuracy or genuineness of any such request or
                  demand or any certificate or statement in connection therewith
                  or any incapacity of or limitation upon the powers of any
                  person signing or issuing any such request, demand,
                  certificate or statement which appears on its face to be in
                  order and agrees that the Issuer shall not be obliged to
                  enquire as to any such matters and may assume that any such
                  request, demand, certificate or statement which appears on its
                  face to be in order is correct and properly made.

6.13.2   RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION AND SUBROGATION: Until all amounts which are or
         may become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the
         Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and the Agent, the
         Issuer, the Swingline Lender and/or the Lenders are under no liability
         hereunder, whether actual or contingent, no Borrower shall, by virtue
         of any payment made by it under or in connection with or referable to
         this clause 6 or otherwise be subrogated to any rights, security or
         monies held or received by the Agent, the Lenders and/or the Security
         Trustee or be entitled at any time to exercise, claim or have the
         benefit of any right of contribution or subrogation or similar right
         against any of them and each Borrower irrevocably waives all rights of
         contribution or similar rights against each of them.

6.13.3   WAIVER OF DEFENCES: Each Borrower's obligations under this clause 6
         shall not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but
         for this provision, might reduce, release or prejudice any of its
         obligations hereunder in whole or in part, including without limitation
         and whether or not known to it:

         (a)      any time or waiver granted to or composition with any
                  beneficiary or any other person;

         (b)      any taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or
                  release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or
                  enforce, any rights, remedies or securities available to the
                  Issuer or other person or arising under any Letter of Credit
                  or Guarantee; or

         (c)      any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any Letter
                  of Credit or Guarantee to the intent that each Borrower's
                  obligations under

                                       37

                  if there were no such effect.

6.14     SUPPORTING LETTER OF CREDIT; CASH COLLATERAL

         If, notwithstanding the provisions of this clause 6 and clause 29 any
         Letter of Credit or Guarantee is outstanding upon the termination of
         this Agreement, then upon such termination each Borrower shall deposit
         with the Security Trustee, at its discretion, with respect to each
         Letter of Credit or Guarantee then outstanding, in its favour and at
         its request either:

         6.14.1   a standby letter of credit (a "SUPPORTING LETTER OF CREDIT")
                  in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and the
                  Security Trustee, issued by an issuer satisfactory to the
                  Lenders in an amount equal to the greatest amount for which
                  such Letter of Credit may be drawn (or, as the case may be,
                  the maximum contingent liability under such Letter of Credit
                  or Guarantee) together with all fees, expenses and charges in
                  respect thereof (together the "MAXIMUM LIABILITY") under which
                  Supporting Letter of Credit the Security Trustee is entitled
                  to draw amounts necessary to reimburse the Issuer (through the
                  Agent) for payments made by the Issuer under such Letter of
                  Credit or Guarantee; or

         6.14.2   cash in an amount equal to such maximum liability.

         Such Supporting Letter of Credit or deposit of cash shall be held by
         the Security Trustee as security for, and to provide for the payment
         of, the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit or, as the case
         may be, the aggregate maximum contingent liability under all
         Guarantees, remaining outstanding.

6.15     AGENT LOANS

6.15.1   AUTHORISATION: Subject to the provisions of this clause 6.15, the Agent
         is hereby authorised by each Borrower and the Lenders, from time to
         time in the Agent's reasonable discretion, after the occurrence of a
         Default or an Event of Default which is continuing unremedied or
         unwaived or at any time that any of the other conditions to the making
         available of any Loans hereunder have not been satisfied (and provided
         in any such case that it is impractical to contact the Lenders), to
         make Reference Rate Revolving Loans (but in any event not to exceed the
         Available Facility) to a Borrower on behalf of the Lenders which the
         Agent, in its reasonable business judgement, deems necessary or
         desirable (i) to preserve or protect any Collateral, (ii) to enhance
         the likelihood of, or maximise the amount of, repayment of any of the
         Outstandings or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to that
         Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including without
         limitation any costs, fees and expenses (any such Reference Rate
         Revolving Loan described in this clause 6.15 being an "AGENT LOAN").

6.15.2   REVOCATION OF AUTHORISATION: The Lenders may at any time revoke the
         Agent's authorisation contained in clause 6.15.1 to make Agent Loans,
         any

                                       38
<PAGE>

         such revocation to be in writing and to become effective only upon the
         Agent's actual receipt thereof.

6.15.3   REPAYMENT: Agent Loans shall constitute Reference Rate Revolving Loans
         under this Agreement repayable by the relevant Borrower on demand and
         shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to Reference Rate
         Revolving Loans plus 2%. The Agent shall notify each Lender in writing
         of each Agent Loan that it makes.

6.15.4   SETTLEMENT: It is agreed that each Lender shall participate in each
         such Reference Rate Revolving Loan constituted by an Agent Loan in an
         amount equal to its Participating Proportion of the amount of such
         Reference Rate Revolving Loan. Notwithstanding such agreement, the
         Agent and the Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the
         benefit of or enforceable by the Borrowers) that in order to facilitate
         the administration of this Agreement settlement of Agent Loans shall
         take place on a periodic basis on such date or dates as the Agent may
         specify by written notice to the Lenders. On receipt of any such
         notice, each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Participating
         Proportion of the outstanding principal amount of the Agent Loans in
         respect of which settlement is requested available to the Agent in
         immediately available funds to such account of the Agent as the Agent
         may designate, not later than 2.00 pm on the proposed settlement date
         (which shall be not less than three business days following the date of
         such notice). If any such amount is not made available to the Agent by
         any Lender on such settlement date, such Lender shall pay such amount
         to the Agent on demand together with interest thereon from such
         settlement date to the date of actual payment calculated at a rate per
         annum which is the sum of (i) two per cent (2%) (ii) the Applicable
         Margin and (iii) the Reference Rate.

6.16     PARTICIPATION AND NOTIFICATION

6.16.1   PARTICIPATION BY LENDERS: Each Lender will participate through its
         Facility Office in each Utilisation hereunder, comprising the making of
         the Revolving Loans, or in any amount to be reimbursed to the Swingline
         Lender or the Issuer following any non-payment by any Borrower of any
         amount due from it in respect of a Swingline Loan or, as appropriate, a
         Letter of Credit or Guarantee, in the proportion which its Commitment
         bears to the Total Commitments immediately prior to the making
         available of that Utilisation or, as the case may be, at the time of
         any such non-payment.

6.16.2   NOTIFICATION TO LENDERS: The Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it
         of a Utilisation Notice, notify each Lender of the details of such
         notice and of the amount of that Lender's share of the Utilisation to
         be made available to the relevant Borrower.

7        INTEREST AND INTEREST PERIODS

7.1      DATES OF PAYMENT OF INTEREST

         Each Revolving Loan shall bear interest on its unpaid principal amount
         from the date made until paid in cash at a rate determined by reference
         to

                                       39
<PAGE>

         the Reference Rate or to LIBOR, as applicable, and the relevant
         Borrower shall pay accrued interest on each such Revolving Loan (i) in
         the case of each Reference Rate Revolving Loan, on the first day of
         each month thereafter and (ii) in the case of each LIBOR Revolving
         Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period relating to such LIBOR
         Revolving Loan.

7.2      RATE OF INTEREST

7.2.1    The rate of interest applicable to a LIBOR Revolving Loan from time to
         time during an Interest Period relating to it shall be the rate per
         annum which is the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin at such time, (ii)
         LIBOR relating to such LIBOR Revolving Loan for such Interest Period
         and (iii) the Mandatory Cost, if any, applicable to that LIBOR
         Revolving Loan.

7.2.2    The rate of interest applicable to a Swingline Loan and each Reference
         Rate Revolving Loan shall be a fluctuating rate per annum which is the
         sum of the Reference Rate and the Applicable Margin. Each change in the
         Reference Rate shall be reflected in such interest rate as of the
         effective date of such change.

7.3      INTEREST PERIODS - LIBOR REVOLVING LOANS

         Save as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the duration of each
         Interest Period relating to a LIBOR Revolving Loan shall be the period
         selected by the relevant Borrower in the Utilisation Notice relating to
         that LIBOR Revolving Loan.

7.4      MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INTEREST PERIODS

         A Borrower may not select an Interest Period in respect of any LIBOR
         Revolving Loan of such a duration that there shall at any time be more
         than five Interest Periods in existence at the same time.

7.5      CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OF REVOLVING LOANS

7.5.1    Ideal (on behalf of the Borrowers) may, upon irrevocable written notice
         to the Agent in accordance with clause 7.5.2:

         (a)      at any time after the Outstandings in respect of Reference
                  Revolving Rate Loans are equal to or exceed an amount equal to
                  an Original Sterling Amount of L20,000,000 elect, as of any
                  business day, in the case of Reference Rate Revolving Loans,
                  to convert any such Reference Rate Revolving Loans (or any
                  part thereof) in an amount or integral multiple of not less
                  than L1,000,000 into LIBOR Revolving Loans;

         (b)      elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
                  to continue any LIBOR Revolving Loans having Interest Periods
                  expiring on such day (or any part thereof) in an amount or
                  integral multiple of not less than L1,000,000.

                                       40
<PAGE>

7.5.2    If any Revolving Loans are to be converted into or continued as LIBOR
         Revolving Loans, Ideal shall deliver a notice of conversion or
         continuation (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION/CONTINUATION") to be received by
         the Agent not later than 11.00 a.m. at least 1 business day (in the
         case of any Revolving Loan denominated in sterling) and at least 3
         business days (in the case of any Revolving Loan denominated in a
         Foreign Currency), in advance of the proposed date of conversion or
         continuation specifying:

         (a)      the proposed date of such conversion or continuation;

         (b)      the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans to be converted or
                  continued; and

         (c)      the type of Revolving Loans resulting from the proposed
                  conversion or continuation.

7.5.3    If upon drawdown of any Revolving Loan or upon the expiry of any
         Interest Period applicable to any LIBOR Revolving Loan, Ideal has
         failed to select a new Interest Period to be applicable thereto or if
         any Default or Event of Default then exists, Ideal shall be deemed to
         have elected to convert such LIBOR Revolving Loan into a Reference Rate
         Revolving Loan as of the expiry date of such Interest Period.

7.5.4    During the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, Ideal may not
         elect to have a Revolving Loan converted into or continued as a LIBOR
         Revolving Loan.

7.6      MARGIN RATCHET

7.6.1    The Agent and the Lenders agree with the Borrowers that the level of
         the Applicable Margin will be periodically reviewed by the Agent. The
         Agent agrees that (A) the first such review shall take place on the
         date upon which the Agent receives all of the signed, audited,
         consolidated Financial Statements of every Group Company for the
         Financial Year ended 31 December 2003 required to be delivered pursuant
         to clause 15.1 and (B) the second such review shall take place on the
         date upon which the Agent receives all of the signed, audited,
         consolidated Financial Statements of every Group Company for the
         Financial Year ended 31 December 2004, required to be delivered
         pursuant to clause 15.1 (each such date being, a "REVIEW DATE"). Each
         Borrower acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding any extension(s)
         of the Termination Date which may be agreed to pursuant to clause 9.5,
         the Agent will not review the Applicable Margin and the Applicable
         Margin may not be reduced on more than two occasions. The Agent and the
         Lenders agree with Ideal and each other Borrower that, provided that
         the conditions set out in clause 7.6.2 are satisfied on the relevant
         Review Date, the Applicable Margin shall be adjusted in accordance with
         this clause 7.6 with effect from the date determined in accordance with
         clause 7.6.5.

7.6.2    If on any Review Date, the Agent's review of the financial performance
         of the Group during the immediately preceding Financial Year indicates
         that actual

                                       41
<PAGE>

         EBITDA achieved in such Financial Year exceeded the projected EBITDA
         for such Financial Year (as set out in the projections delivered to the
         Agent prior to the Closing Date) by an amount equal to or greater than
         twenty per cent. (20%) of such projected EBITDA, then the Applicable
         Margin which shall apply for Swingline Loans, Reference Rate Revolving
         Loans and LIBOR Revolving Loans until the next Review Date shall be the
         then prevailing Applicable Margin (which as at the Closing Date shall,
         for the avoidance of doubt, be 2.25% per annum) less 0.125%.

7.6.3    For the avoidance of doubt, the original or most recently adjusted
         Applicable Margin for the Revolving Facility shall apply if the
         condition set out in clause 7.6.2 is not met.

7.6.4    Any decrease of the Applicable Margin shall be determined by the Agent
         on any Review Date by reference to the signed, audited Financial
         Statements most recently delivered to the Agent under clause 15.1.

7.6.5    Any adjustment of the Applicable Margin in accordance with this clause
         7.6 shall take effect in respect of any Reference Rate Revolving Loan,
         LIBOR Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan, with effect from the relevant
         Review Date.

7.6.6    At any time while a Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         original Applicable Margin for the Revolving Facility shall apply with
         immediate effect, notwithstanding any previous reduction of such
         Applicable Margin made pursuant to this clause 7.6 and no reduction
         shall be instituted while a Default has occurred and is continuing.

8        MARKET DISRUPTION

8.1      CIRCUMSTANCES

         If at or about 11.00 am on the Quotation Date for an Interest Period in
         respect of any LIBOR Revolving Loan the Agent (in consultation with the
         Lenders) determines it is not possible by reason of circumstances
         affecting the London Interbank Market generally (i) to determine LIBOR
         in accordance with its definition, or (ii) for the Lenders to obtain
         requisite matching deposits in the required currency in the London
         Interbank Market at the relevant time to fund their respective shares
         during such Interest Period, or (iii) for the Majority Lenders to
         obtain such deposits for such period at a cost less than or equal to
         the rate offered to the Agent in accordance with the definition of
         LIBOR, then the Agent shall forthwith notify Ideal and the Lenders and
         notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7, the Interest Period in
         respect of that LIBOR Revolving Loan and the amount of interest payable
         in respect of that LIBOR Revolving Loan during its Interest Period
         shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions of this
         clause 8.

8.2      APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE

         If clause 8.1 applies in relation to a LIBOR Revolving Loan the
         duration of the Interest Period relating to that Loan shall be one
         month or, if less, such that

                                       42
<PAGE>

         it shall end on the Termination Date and the rate of interest
         applicable to that LIBOR Revolving Loan during its Interest Period
         shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of (i) the Applicable
         Margin, (ii) the Mandatory Cost, if any, and (iii) the rate determined
         by the Agent (and notified to Ideal) to be that which expresses as a
         percentage rate per annum the weighted average of the cost to each of
         the Lenders of funding its share of such LIBOR Revolving Loan during
         such Interest Period from whatever sources and in whatever manner each
         such Lender may reasonably select.

8.3      REVIEW OF CIRCUMSTANCES

         So long as any alternative basis for the calculation of interest as
         provided in clause 8.2 is in force the Agent shall from time to time
         review whether or not the circumstances referred to in clause 8.1 still
         prevail with a view to returning to the normal provisions of this
         Agreement relating to the determination of the rates of interest
         applicable to any LIBOR Revolving Loan.

8.4      DISTRIBUTION OF INTEREST

         Interest on a LIBOR Revolving Loan during an Interest Period relating
         to it calculated at the rates specified in clause 8.1 or 8.2 shall be
         distributed by the Agent to the Lenders in proportion to the amounts
         which represent the cost to each Lender of funding its share of such
         LIBOR Revolving Loan during such Interest Period provided that any such
         interest which is attributable to the Applicable Margin shall be
         distributed by the Agent to the Lenders in proportion to their
         respective shares in such LIBOR Revolving Loan.

9        REPAYMENT, PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION

9.1      REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS

         Each Borrower shall repay each LIBOR Revolving Loan made to it,
         together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the last day of
         the Interest Period applicable to that Loan. Each Borrower may repay
         each Reference Rate Revolving Loan and each Swingline Loan made to it,
         together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, at any time. Each
         Borrower shall, in any event, repay the outstanding principal balance
         of all Revolving Loans made to it, plus all accrued but unpaid interest
         thereon, upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. In
         addition, and without limiting the generality of each foregoing, each
         Borrower shall pay to the Agent, on demand, the amount by which the
         Original Sterling Amount of the unpaid principal balance of any
         Revolving Loans and any Swingline Loans when aggregated with the
         Original Sterling Amount of the maximum face amount of all Letters of
         Credit and the maximum contingent liability under all Guarantees then
         in issue (together "CONTINGENCY OUTSTANDINGS") at any time exceeds the
         Available Facility in respect of the Revolving Facility or the
         Available Revolving Facility Amount, the Available Facility and
         Available Revolving Facility Amount being determined for this purpose
         as if the amount of the Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and
         contingency outstandings were zero. Subject to the other terms of this
         Agreement and to availability, Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans may
         be reborrowed.

                                       43
<PAGE>

9.2      CANCELLATION OF TOTAL COMMITMENTS

         Any Borrower may, by giving to the Agent not less than 30 business
         days' prior notice to that effect, permanently cancel the whole (but
         subject to clause 29) or any part (being a minimum amount of L5,000,000
         and an integral multiple of L1,000,000) of the Total Commitments,
         provided that both on the date of such notice and upon the effective
         date of cancellation, the amount to be so cancelled does not exceed an
         amount equal to the difference between the Maximum Revolving Credit
         Line and the Total Outstandings and the Agent has not, pursuant to
         clause 6.7, permitted the limits of the Available Revolving Facility
         Amount to have been exceeded. Any such cancellation shall reduce the
         Commitment of each Lender pro rata. If a Borrower cancels any part (but
         not the whole) of the Total Commitments, Ideal shall (or shall procure
         that such other Borrower shall) pay to the Agent (for the rateable
         benefit of the Lenders), on or prior to the date of such cancellation:

         9.2.1    2% of the amount of the Total Commitments so cancelled, if
                  such cancellation is made on or prior to the first Anniversary
                  Date;

         9.2.2    1% of the amount of the Total Commitments so cancelled, if
                  such cancellation is made on or prior to the second
                  Anniversary Date; and

         9.2.3    0.5% of the amount of the Total Commitments so cancelled, if
                  such cancellation is made at any time after the second
                  Anniversary Date.

9.3      PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION OF INDIVIDUAL BANKS

         If a Borrower becomes obliged to pay an increased amount pursuant to
         clauses 10.1 or 11.1 or any Lender claims indemnification from Ideal
         under clause 10.2 or clause 11.1 and the Agent receives from Ideal at
         least fifteen days' prior notice of the intention of the Borrowers to
         prepay such Lender's Outstandings, such Lender shall, upon receipt by
         the Agent of such notice, cease to be obliged to participate in any
         further Loans, its Commitment shall be permanently cancelled and
         reduced to zero and the each Borrower shall on the last day of each of
         the then current Interest Periods or earlier, if the Agent or such
         Lender so requires, prepay such Lender's portion of the Loan to which
         such Interest Period relates together with any applicable break costs
         payable under clause 19.2 but otherwise without premium or penalty.

9.4      NOTICES IRREVOCABLE

         Any notice of cancellation or prepayment given by a Borrower (or Ideal
         on its behalf) pursuant to clause 9.2 or clause 9.3 shall be
         irrevocable, shall specify the date upon which such prepayment is to be
         made and the amount of such prepayment and shall oblige that Borrower
         to make such prepayment on such date. A Borrower shall not be entitled
         to reborrow any amount so prepaid.

                                       44
<PAGE>

9.5      EXTENSION OF TERMINATION DATE

9.5.1    Not earlier than 90 but not later than 60 days prior to the second
         Anniversary Date (and if the Termination Date is extended in accordance
         with this clause 9.5, prior to any subsequent Anniversary Date), Ideal
         may deliver a request to the Agent (which the Agent shall promptly
         forward to the Lenders), requesting that the Lenders shall extend the
         maturity of the Revolving Facility for a further period of twelve (12)
         months from the then applicable Termination Date (as the same may be
         extended from time to time under this clause 9.5).

9.5.2    The decision whether or not to extend the Termination Date shall be in
         the absolute discretion of the Agent to determine (acting on the
         instructions of all of the Lenders) and shall be based upon such
         factors as the Agent may deem relevant (including, without limitation,
         the business condition (financial or otherwise) of the Group at the
         relevant time and after reviewing such forecasts, projections and
         financial and other information regarding the Borrowers and the Group
         as the Agent may require. The Borrowers acknowledge that the Agent and
         the Lenders shall not be under any obligation to extend the Termination
         Date.

9.5.3    If extended pursuant to this clause 9.5, references to the "TERMINATION
         DATE" in this Agreement and the other Finance Documents shall be
         construed as a reference to the Termination Date as from time to time
         extended.

10       TAXES

10.1     REQUIREMENT TO GROSS-UP

         All payments to be made by any of the Obligors to any person under this
         Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for or
         on account of tax unless such Obligor is required by law to make such a
         payment subject to the deduction or withholding of tax, in which case
         the sum payable by such Obligor in respect of which such deduction or
         withholding is required to be made shall be increased to the extent
         necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or
         withholding (including any deduction or withholding applicable to
         additional sums payable under this clause), such person receives and
         retains (free from any liability in respect of any such deduction or
         withholding) a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received
         and so retained had no such deduction or withholding been made or been
         required to be made.

10.2     INDEMNITY

         Without prejudice to the provisions of clause 10.1, if any person or
         the Agent is required to make any payment on account of tax (other than
         tax on its overall net income) on or calculated by reference to the
         amount of any Loan made or to be made under this Agreement or by
         reference to any Letter of Credit or Guarantee issued under this
         Agreement and/or by reference to any sum received or receivable under
         this Agreement by such person or the Agent on its behalf (including,
         without limitation, any sum received or receivable under this clause
         10) or any liability in respect of any such payment is

                                       45
<PAGE>

         asserted, imposed, levied or assessed against such person or the Agent
         on its behalf, the relevant Obligor shall, upon demand of the Agent,
         promptly indemnify such person against such payment or liability,
         together with any interest, penalties and expenses payable or incurred
         in connection therewith provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
         the extent that the payment or liability (a) is compensated for by an
         increased payment under clause 10.1 or (b) would have been so
         compensated but was not so compensated, solely because one of the
         exclusions in clause 10.6 applied.

10.3     NOTIFICATION

         A Lender intending to make a claim pursuant to clause 10.2 shall notify
         the Agent of the event by reason of which it is entitled to do so
         whereupon the Agent shall notify the relevant Obligor.

10.4     TAX RECEIPTS

         Without prejudice to the provisions of clause 10.1, if any Obligor
         makes any payment under this Agreement in respect of which it is
         required by law to make any deduction or withholding it shall pay the
         full amount to be deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation or
         other authority within the time allowed for such payment under
         applicable law and shall deliver to the Agent (no later than one week
         after the end of the time allowed for such payment under applicable
         law) an original receipt or other appropriate evidence issued by such
         authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so
         required to be deducted or withheld from such payment.

10.5     TAX CREDITS

         If any Obligor makes an increased payment under clause 10.1 for the
         account of any person and such person in its sole opinion and based on
         its own interpretation of any relevant laws or regulations (but acting
         in good faith) determines that it has received or been granted a credit
         against or relief or remission for or in respect of any tax paid or
         payable by it in respect of or calculated by reference to the deduction
         or withholding giving rise to such payment, such person shall, to the
         extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the
         retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or payment
         and, to the extent it is reasonably identifiable and quantifiable, as
         soon as practicable pay to such Obligor an amount equal to such part or
         all of such credit, relief, remission or repayment as can be made
         available to such Obligor in such a way as to leave such person (after
         such payment) in no better or worse position than it would have been in
         if such Obligor had not been required to make such deduction or
         withholding. Nothing contained in this clause 10.5 shall interfere with
         the right of a person to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it
         thinks fit nor oblige any person to disclose any information relation
         to its tax affairs or any computation in respect thereof.

10.6     LIMITATION ON REQUIREMENT TO GROSS-UP

10.6.1   If any Lender ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no Obligor shall be
         liable to pay to such Lender under clause 10.1 any amount in excess of
         the amount it would have been obliged to pay if such Lender had not
         ceased to be a Qualifying Lender provided that this clause 10.6 shall
         not apply and each Obligor shall continue to be obliged to comply with
         its obligations under clause 10 if and to the extent that after the
         date of this Agreement there shall have been any change in, or in the
         interpretation, administration or application of, any relevant law or
         double taxation treaty or any published practice or concession of any
         relevant taxing authority and as a result of such change (i) such
         Lender ceases to be a Qualifying Lender or (ii) such Obligor would be
         required to make a deduction or withholding on account of tax
         irrespective of whether the recipient of the relevant payment was or
         was not a Qualifying Lender.

10.6.2   No Obligor shall be liable to make a payment to a Lender under Clause
         10.1 if on the date on which the payment falls due the relevant Obligor
         is able to show that the payment could have been made to such Lender
         without any deduction or withholding had such Lender complied with its
         obligations under clause 10.7.

10.7     DOUBLE TAXATION RELIEF

         If, and to the extent that, the effect of clause 10.1 or 10.2 can be
         mitigated by virtue of the provisions of any applicable double tax
         treaty entered into by the United Kingdom (whether by a claim to
         repayment of any taxes referred to in clause 10.1 or 10.2 or otherwise)
         each Lender agrees to co-operate (to the extent reasonably required)
         with affected Obligor(s) with a view to submitting any forms required
         for the purpose of ensuring the application of such double tax treaty
         so far as relevant, provided that no Lender shall be required pursuant
         to this clause 10.7 to complete or co-operate in completing any form
         which is not substantially similar to any form in use at the date of
         this Agreement for the purpose of claiming exemption or relief from or
         repayment of taxes envisaged hereunder pursuant to a double taxation
         treaty between the United Kingdom and such Lender's jurisdiction of
         residence and which requires the Lender to undertake obligations which,
         in its reasonable opinion, are more onerous than those imposed upon it
         as at the date of this Agreement.

11       INCREASED COSTS

11.1     INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN

         If the Agent or, as the case may be, any Lender, in its sole discretion
         determines that, as a result of (i) the introduction of, or any change
         in any law or in any treaty, directive or regulation (whether or not
         having the force of law but if not having the force of law, only if
         such treaty, directive or regulation is generally applicable to banks
         and of the type with which the relevant Lender is accustomed to comply)
         or the interpretation or application thereof, in each case after the
         date hereof, or (ii) compliance with any request from or requirement
         (whether or not having the force of law but if not having the force

                                       47
<PAGE>

         of law, only if such request or requirement is generally applicable to
         banks and of the type with which the relevant Lender is accustomed to
         comply) of any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
         authority made or imposed after the date hereof:

         11.1.1   it incurs a cost in assuming or maintaining all or any part of
                  any Commitment under this Agreement and/or in making,
                  maintaining or funding all or any part of its Outstandings or
                  any unpaid sum and/or assuming or maintaining a contingent
                  liability under or pursuant to this Agreement (whether under
                  any Letter of Credit or Guarantee or otherwise), or that cost
                  is increased; or

         11.1.2   any sum received or receivable by it under this Agreement or
                  the effective return to it under this Agreement is reduced; or

         11.1.3   it suffers a reduction in the rate of return on its overall
                  capital below that which might reasonably have been
                  anticipated at the date of this Agreement and which it would
                  have been able to achieve but for having entered into and/or
                  performing its obligations and/or assuming or maintaining a
                  commitment or contingent liability under or pursuant to this
                  Agreement; or

         11.1.4   it makes any payment or forgoes any interest or other return
                  on or calculated by reference to the amount of any sum
                  received or receivable by it under or pursuant to this
                  Agreement; or

         11.1.5   it incurs a cost or increased cost, or suffers a reduction in
                  any amount payable to it or in the effective return on its
                  capital, or forgoes any interest or any other return as a
                  result of the introduction of, changeover to or operation of
                  the euro in the United Kingdom,

         and in any such case, the same is attributable to its liabilities or
         obligations under this Agreement, then the person concerned shall
         notify the Agent of the relevant event (setting out in reasonable
         detail the basis on which its claim has been computed) promptly upon
         its becoming aware of the same, whereupon the Agent shall notify Ideal
         and, upon demand of the Agent, Ideal shall pay, or shall procure that
         there is paid, on demand to the Agent for the account of the person
         concerned an amount sufficient to indemnify that person against the
         relevant cost, increased cost, reduction, reduction in the rate of
         return, payment or forgone interest or other return or such proportion
         thereof as is, in the opinion of such person, attributable to its
         obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement.

11.2     CAPITAL ADEQUACY

         If the Agent, or as the case may be, any Lender, in its sole discretion
         determines that (i) the introduction of, or any change in, any capital
         adequacy regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof, in
         each case after the date hereof, or (ii) compliance by such person or
         any corporation controlling it with any capital adequacy regulation,
         affects or would affect the amount of

                                       48
<PAGE>

         capital, reserves or special deposits required or expected to be
         maintained by such person or any corporation controlling it and (taking
         into consideration such person's or such corporation's policies with
         respect to capital adequacy) determines that the amount of such
         capital, reserves or special deposits is increased as a consequence of
         its loans, contingent liabilities or obligations under this Agreement
         then, upon demand of the Agent (having been so notified by such person)
         to Ideal, Ideal shall pay, or shall procure that there is paid, to the
         Agent for the account of the person concerned, from time to time as
         specified by the Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
         such person for such increase.

11.3     EXCEPTIONS

         Clauses 11.1 and 11.2 do not apply to any cost, increased cost,
         reduction, reduction in the rate of return, payment or forgone interest
         or other return compensated for by (a) payment of the Mandatory Cost,
         (b) by the operation of clause 10, (c) by a change in the rate of tax
         on the overall net income of the Agent or any Lender or (d) which is
         attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Lender or any of its
         Affiliates of any law or regulation.

12       ILLEGALITY

12.1     CONSEQUENCES OF ILLEGALITY

         If at any time it is unlawful, or contrary to any directive or request
         of any applicable central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
         authority, or impossible for a Lender to make, fund or allow to remain
         outstanding any Loan made or to be made under this Agreement or to
         assume or remain under any obligations hereunder in relation to or
         under any Letter of Credit or Guarantee, then the Agent shall, promptly
         after becoming aware of the same, deliver to Ideal a certificate to
         that effect and:

         12.1.1   such Lender shall not thereafter be obliged to make or
                  participate in any Loan under this Agreement or (in the case
                  of the Issuer) issue any Letter of Credit or Guarantee and its
                  Commitment shall immediately be cancelled and reduced to zero;
                  and

         12.1.2   if the Agent on behalf of such Lender so requires, each
                  Borrower shall on the last day of the Interest Period for each
                  such Loan occurring after the Agent has notified Ideal or (if
                  earlier) on such date as the Agent shall have specified (being
                  no earlier than the last day upon which the Lender is legally
                  able to permit such Loans to remain outstanding) repay such
                  Lender's Outstandings together with accrued interest thereon
                  (any such repayment to be without premium or penalty or the
                  payment of any amount to be calculated in accordance with
                  clause 29.2.3) and all other amounts owing to such Lender
                  under this Agreement, and, with respect to any Letter of
                  Credit or Guarantee then outstanding, deposit with the
                  Security Trustee for the benefit of the Issuer a Supporting
                  Letter of Credit or cash, in either such case in the same
                  manner as contemplated in clause 6.14.

                                       49
<PAGE>

12.2     MITIGATION OF ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES

         If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would, or would
         upon the giving of notice, result in additional amounts becoming
         payable under clause 10 or clause 11.1 or result in a cancellation of
         its Commitment pursuant to clause 12.1.1 then, without in any way
         limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the obligations of any
         Borrower hereunder such Lender will, at the request of Ideal, consider
         means of mitigating the effects of such circumstances provided that
         such Lender shall be under no obligation to take any such action if to
         do so would or might in its opinion have an adverse effect on its
         business, operations or financial condition.

13       GUARANTEE

13.1     GUARANTEE

         Each Unsecured Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally and
         irrevocably guarantees to the Beneficiaries the due and punctual
         payment, performance and discharge by the Obligors of all the monies,
         obligations and liabilities (whether present or future, actual or
         contingent) on the part of the Obligors to be paid, performed or
         discharged, whether directly or indirectly, under or pursuant to the
         terms of this Agreement and/or in connection with the Facility and/or
         otherwise under the Finance Documents (together in this clause 13 the
         "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"). If and whenever any Obligor shall default in
         the payment, discharge or performance of any of the guaranteed
         obligations, each Unsecured Guarantor shall, upon written demand by the
         Agent, promptly pay, perform or discharge the guaranteed obligations in
         respect of which such default has been made.

13.2     INDEMNITY

         Each Unsecured Guarantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
         Beneficiaries from time to time on demand for and against any loss
         incurred by any of them as a result of any of the guaranteed
         obligations being or becoming void, voidable or unenforceable for any
         reason whatsoever, whether known to such person or persons or not. The
         amount of such loss shall be the amount which the person or persons
         suffering it would otherwise have been entitled to recover from the
         Obligors.

13.3     CONTINUING SECURITY

         The obligations of each Unsecured Guarantor under this Agreement are
         continuing obligations and shall remain in force until all of the
         guaranteed obligations have been satisfied in full. The obligations of
         each Unsecured Guarantor under this Agreement shall not be (or be
         construed so as to be) discharged by any intermediate discharge or
         payment of or on account of any of the guaranteed obligations or any
         settlement of account or any other matter (other than the discharge in
         full of the guaranteed obligations).

13.4     PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS

         Neither the obligations of each Unsecured Guarantor nor the rights and
         remedies of the Beneficiaries under this Agreement, any other Finance
         Document or otherwise conferred by law shall be discharged, prejudiced
         or impaired by reason of:

         13.4.1   any variation of any of the guaranteed obligations or of the
                  terms of conditions of this Agreement, any other Finance
                  Document or of any encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance
                  held or to be held as security for the payment, performance or
                  discharge of the guaranteed obligations (any such encumbrance,
                  guarantee or other assurance together referred to in this
                  clause 13 as "RELATED SECURITY");

         13.4.2   any failure (whether intentional or not) to take, perfect or
                  realise (whether in full or in part) any related security now
                  or in the future agreed to be taken in respect of any of the
                  guaranteed obligations;

         13.4.3   any capacity or change in the constitution of any party to
                  this Agreement, any other Finance Document or to any related
                  security;

         13.4.4   any of the guaranteed obligations or any obligation of any
                  person under any related security being or becoming invalid,
                  illegal, void or unenforceable for any reason;

         13.4.5   any time or other indulgence given or agreed to be given to,
                  or any composition or other arrangement made with or accepted
                  from, any Obligor in respect of any of the guaranteed
                  obligations or any other person in respect of any of its
                  obligations under any related security;

         13.4.6   any waiver or release of any of the guaranteed obligations or
                  of any obligation of any person under any related security or
                  any failure to realise, in full or in part, the value of, or
                  any discharge or exchange of any related security;

         13.4.7   any Obligor or any other person party to this Agreement, any
                  other Finance Document or any related security being wound up,
                  going into administration or liquidation or making any
                  composition or arrangement with its creditors (whether or not
                  sanctioned by the court and whether or not the Agent has
                  agreed to such compromise or arrangement) and so that where,
                  by virtue of any compromise or arrangement, any of the
                  guaranteed obligations are transferred to any other person,
                  the guarantee and indemnity of each Unsecured Guarantor
                  contained in this Agreement shall take effect as if the
                  expression "Obligor" included such other person; or

         13.4.8   any other act, event or omission which, but for this
                  provision, would or might operate to offer any legal or
                  equitable defence for or impair or discharge any of the
                  guaranteed obligations or any

                                       51
<PAGE>

                  obligation of any person under any related security or
                  prejudicially affect the rights or remedies of the
                  Beneficiaries or any of them under this Agreement, any other
                  Finance Document or otherwise conferred by law.

13.5     INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS

         The obligations of each Unsecured Guarantor under this Agreement are
         additional to, and not in substitution for, any related security and
         the obligations assumed by each Unsecured Guarantor under this
         Agreement may be enforced without first having recourse to any related
         security and without making or filing any claim or proof in a
         winding-up or dissolution of any Obligor or any other person party to
         this Agreement or any related security or first taking any steps or
         proceedings against any Obligor or any such person.

13.6     NON-COMPETITION

         Until all of the guaranteed obligations have been satisfied in full, no
         Unsecured Guarantor shall:

         13.6.1   exercise any right of subrogation, indemnity, set-off or
                  counterclaim against any Obligor, any other Unsecured
                  Guarantor or any person party to any related security;

         13.6.2   claim payment of any other monies for the time being due to it
                  by any Obligor, any other Unsecured Guarantor or any person
                  party to any related security by reason of the performance by
                  it of its obligations under this Agreement or on any account
                  whatsoever or exercise any other right or remedy or enforce
                  any encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance which it has in
                  respect thereof;

         13.6.3   claim any contribution from any other Unsecured Guarantor or
                  any person party to any related security;

         13.6.4   negotiate, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of any monies,
                  obligations or liabilities now or at any future time due or
                  owing to it by any Obligor or any other Unsecured Guarantor or
                  any person party to any related security or any encumbrance,
                  guarantee or other assurance in respect thereof; or

         13.6.5   claim or prove in a winding up or dissolution of the Obligor
                  or any other Unsecured Guarantor in competition with the
                  Beneficiaries or any of them; and

         13.6.6   if any Unsecured Guarantor receives any sums in contravention
                  of this clause 13.6, it shall hold them on trust to be applied
                  promptly in or towards the satisfaction of its obligations
                  under this Agreement.

                                       52
<PAGE>

13.7     WARRANTY

         Each Unsecured Guarantor warrants that it has not taken, and agrees
         that (without the prior written consent of the Agent acting on the
         instructions of the Majority Lenders) it will not take, from any
         Obligor, any other Unsecured Guarantor or any person party to any
         related security any encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance in
         respect of or in connection with its obligations under this Agreement.
         If any Unsecured Guarantor takes any such encumbrance, guarantee or
         other assurance in contravention of this clause 13.7, it shall hold the
         same on trust for the Beneficiaries until such time as all of the
         guaranteed obligations have been satisfied in full and shall on request
         promptly deposit the same with and/or charge the same to the Agent for
         and on behalf of itself and such persons in such manner as the Agent
         may require as security for the due performance and discharge by the
         relevant Unsecured Guarantor of the guaranteed obligations

13.8     SUSPENSE ACCOUNT

         If any Obligor or any of the Unsecured Guarantors is wound up, goes
         into liquidation or makes any composition or arrangement with its
         creditors, neither the existence of the guarantee of the relevant
         Unsecured Guarantor contained in this Agreement nor any monies received
         or recovered by the Beneficiaries or any of them under to pursuant to
         this Agreement shall impair the right of such persons to prove in such
         winding-up, liquidation, composition, or arrangement for the total
         amount due from the Obligor or the relevant Unsecured Guarantor. The
         Agent may at any time and from time to time place and, for so long as
         it thinks fit, keep any monies received or recovered under this
         Agreement in a separate or suspense account, in such name as it thinks
         fit, without any intermediate obligation on its part to apply the same
         in or towards discharge of any part of such total amount, provided that
         if the monies are at any time sufficient to discharge the guaranteed
         obligations in full, they shall promptly be so applied.

13.9     CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE

         Any settlement or discharge between any of the Unsecured Guarantors and
         the Arranger, the Agent, the Lenders or any of them shall be
         conditional upon no security or payment to the Arranger, the Agent and
         the Lenders or any of them by any Obligor or the relevant Unsecured
         Guarantor or any other person being avoided or set aside or ordered to
         be refunded or reduced by or pursuant to any applicable law or
         regulation and, if such condition is not satisfied, the Arranger, the
         Agent and the Lenders shall each be entitled to recover from the
         relevant Unsecured Guarantor on demand the value of any such security
         or the amount of any such payment as if such settlement or discharge
         had not occurred.

         BMEP, BMEBV, Ideal and BMEE shall each ensure that:

         15.3.1   TRUE AND FAIR VIEW: each set of Financial Statements delivered
                  by it or at its request pursuant to clause 15.2.1 is prepared
                  (except as stated therein) using the same accounting
                  principles and policies as were used in the preparation of the
                  Pro-Forma Balance Sheet and gives a true and fair view of the
                  financial condition of the Group, as at the end of the period
                  to which those Financial Statements relate and of the result
                  of their respective businesses and operations during such
                  period;

         15.3.2   AUDIT: each set of Financial Statements delivered by it or at
                  its request pursuant to clause 15.2.1 has been audited by the
                  Auditors and each set of Management Accounts delivered by it
                  pursuant to clause 15.2.2 has been certified as being correct
                  by Ideal (acting through its finance director), subject to

                  of a Management Accounting Period ending on the last day of
                  any Financial Quarter (as consolidated for that Financial
                  Quarter) is accompanied by a certificate of Ideal (acting
                  through its finance director) setting forth in reasonable
                  detail the calculations required to establish that BMEP was in
                  compliance with its covenants set forth in clause 15.4 during
                  the period covered in such Financial Statements (or, as the
                  case may be, during such Financial Quarter) and stating that,
                  except as explained in reasonable detail in such certificate:

         (a)      all of the representations and warranties of each Obligor
                  contained in this Agreement and the other Finance Documents
                  are correct and complete as at the date of such certificate as

         warranty is not correct or complete, or that a covenant has not been
         complied with, or that an Event of Default existed or exists, such
         certificate shall set forth what action Ideal or the relevant Obligor
         has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto.

15.4     FINANCIAL RATIOS

         BMEP shall ensure that, at all times, the consolidated financial
         condition of BMEP shall be such that the Adjusted Tangible Net Worth of
         BMEP shall not at any time be less than EUR18,467,000, as determined as
         at the Closing Date by reference to the Pro-Forma Balance Sheet and
         thereafter by reference to the accounting information (the "RELEVANT
         ACCOUNTING INFORMATION") most recently delivered under this Agreement
         being (i) the annual audited consolidated Financial Statements
         delivered under clause 15.2.1 and (ii) each set of Management Accounts
         (consolidated and consolidating for the relevant Financial Quarter)
         delivered under clause 15.2.2 and so that for the purposes of this
         clause 15 the term "FINANCIAL QUARTER" shall mean each period of three
         months ending on each of 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31
         December in any year. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
         clause 15.4, BMEP and each other Obligor agrees that if, following
         receipt by the Agent of the first set of audited Financial Statements
         of BMEP and the first set of audited, consolidated Financial Statements
         of the Group delivered to the Agent after the Closing Date, the Agent
         determines, by reference to such audited Financial Statements, that the
         Adjusted Tangible Net Worth of BMEP as at the Closing Date was actually
         in excess of EUR18,467,000, then the Agent shall be entitled to re-set
         the financial ratio set out in this clause 15.4 to such higher figure
         (if any) as may have been determined by reference to such Financial
         Statements, following which this clause 15.4 shall be construed so as
         to refer to such higher figure.

15.5     FINANCIAL RATIOS - DEFINITION OF TERMS

         ADJUSTED TANGIBLE ASSETS: means all of BMEP's assets except:

         (i)      deferred assets, other than prepaid insurance and prepaid
                  taxes;

         (ii)     patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, franchises,

         (vi)     fixed assets to the extent of any write-up in the book value
                  thereof resulting from a revaluation effective after the date
                  of this Agreement; and

                                       62
<PAGE>

         ADJUSTED TANGIBLE NET WORTH: means, at any date:

         (i)      the book value (after deducting related depreciation,
                  amortisation, valuation and other proper reserves as
                  determined in accordance with Applicable GAAP) at which the
                  Adjusted Tangible Assets would be shown on a balance sheet of
                  BMEP at such date prepared in accordance with Applicable GAAP;
                  less

         (ii)     the amount at which BMEP's liabilities would be shown on such
                  balance sheet, including as liabilities all reserves for
                  contingencies and other potential liabilities which would be
                  required to be shown on such balance sheet.

15.6     CHANGES IN BASIS OF PREPARATION OF RELEVANT ACCOUNTING INFORMATION

         Where any Relevant Accounting Information to be delivered under clause
         15 has been prepared in a manner which is inconsistent with the
         accounting principles or policies in accordance with which the
         Pro-Forma Balance Sheet was prepared, whether as a result of any change
         in such principles or otherwise, BMEP or Ideal shall provide to the
         Agent a written explanation of any such inconsistency, together with
         details of its effects. If any such inconsistency would be likely to
         affect the ability of the Agent to satisfy itself from the information
         delivered as Relevant Accounting Information as to compliance with the
         provisions of clause 15.4, the Agent shall have the right to adjust the
         financial ratios set out in clause 15.4 or the relevant definitions set
         out in clause 15.5 so as to reflect so far as is practicable the effect
         of any such change (provided that the effect of such adjustments,
         taking into consideration such change, shall not be such as to render
         the said financial ratios more onerous upon BMEP than as at the date of
         this Agreement).

16.1     DURATION

                           non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with any
                           Environmental Law has occurred and prepare and
                           deliver to the Agent a report setting forth the

                  licences and consents) to obtain, preserve and keep in full
                  force and effect all rights, licences and authorisations
                  (including, without limitation, all Environmental

                  appropriate amount. Each Borrower shall immediately report to
                  the Agent any return involving an amount in excess of
                  L1,000,000. Each such report shall indicate the reasons for

                  this Agreement to be due and payable on demand or on such date
                  as it may specify in such notice whereupon all such monies
                  shall become so due and payable on demand or on such date (as
                  the case may be);

                  manner as contemplated in clause 6.14;

         17.2.6   declare the Revolving Facility to be cancelled, whereupon it

         17.2.7   enforce any or all of its rights or require that the Security
                  Trustee enforce any or all of its rights under any of the
                  Finance Documents or under applicable law.

17.3     ON DEMAND FACILITY

         If, pursuant to clause 17.2.4, the Agent declares any of the Loans (or
         any other monies which may become payable hereunder) to be due and
         payable on demand of the Agent, then, at any time thereafter, the Agent
         may by written notice to Ideal call for repayment of any such Loans
         (and any other such monies) on such date as it may specify in such
         notice (whereupon the same shall become due and payable on such date
         together with all unpaid accrued interest, fees and any other sums then
         owed by the Borrowers hereunder) or withdraw its declaration with
         effect from such date as it may specify in such notice.

17.4     LETTER OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEE FEE FOLLOWING EVENT OF DEFAULT

         From the date of the occurrence of any Event of Default until such

         liability of the Issuer under each Guarantee then outstanding.

17.5     TERMINATION FEE

         If the Agent terminates this Agreement upon an Event of Default, Ideal
         shall pay the Agent for the account of the Lenders in their
         Participating Proportion, immediately upon termination, a fee equal to
         the early termination fee that would have been payable under clause 29
         if this Agreement had been terminated on that date pursuant to Ideal's
         election.

18       DEFAULT INTEREST

18.1     INTEREST ON UNPAID SUMS

         If any relevant Obligor does not pay any sum payable by it under this
         Agreement on its due date in accordance with the provisions of clause
         20 or if any sum due and payable by any relevant Obligor under any
         judgment of any court in connection with this Agreement is not paid on
         the date of such

                                       82
<PAGE>

         judgment, it shall pay interest on the balance for the time being
         outstanding (such balance being referred to in this Agreement as the
         "UNPAID SUM") for the period beginning on such due date or, as the case
         may be, the date of such judgment, in accordance with the provisions of
         this clause 18.

18.2     DEFAULT INTEREST PERIODS

         Interest under this clause 18 shall be calculated by reference to
         successive periods, each of which (other than the first, which shall
         begin on the due date for payment or, as the case may be, the date of
         judgment as referred to in clause 18.1) shall begin on the last day of
         the preceding period. Each such period shall be of such duration as the
         Agent may select.

18.3     DEFAULT INTEREST RATES

         The rate of interest applicable to an unpaid sum from time to time
         during each period relating to that unpaid sum shall be the rate per
         annum which is the sum of (i) two per cent (2%) (ii) the Applicable
         Margin (iii) LIBOR relative to such period (or, in respect of any
         Swingline Loans or Reference Rate Revolving Loans, the Reference Rate)
         and (iv) the Mandatory Cost, if any, applicable to that unpaid sum
         provided that:

         18.3.1   if, at or about 11.00 am on the Quotation Date in respect of
                  such unpaid sum, it is not possible to determine LIBOR in
                  accordance with the definition of LIBOR there shall be
                  substituted for LIBOR the rate determined by the Agent (and
                  notified to Ideal) to be the weighted average of the rates (as
                  notified to the Agent by the Lenders prior to the first day of
                  the relevant Interest Period) which represent the cost to each
                  Lender of funding its portion of such unpaid sum during such
                  period from whatever sources and in whatever manner it may
                  select; and

         18.3.2   if the unpaid sum is of the principal amount of a LIBOR
                  Revolving Loan which became due and payable other than on the
                  last day of any Interest Period relating to it, the first
                  default period applicable to that unpaid sum shall be of a
                  duration equal to the unexpired portion of that Interest
                  Period and the rate of interest applicable to it during that
                  Interest Period shall be the rate per annum equal to the sum
                  of two per cent (2%) and the rate applicable to it immediately
                  before it became due.

18.4     PAYMENT AND COMPOUNDING OF DEFAULT INTEREST

         Any interest accrued due under clause 18.3 in respect of an unpaid sum
         shall be due and payable and shall be paid by the relevant Obligor at
         the end of the period by reference to which it is calculated or on such
         other date as the Agent may specify by written notice to Ideal. If not
         paid on the due date, the interest shall be added to and form part of
         the unpaid sum on which interest shall accrue and be payable in
         accordance with the provisions of this clause 18.

19       INDEMNITIES AND CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT

19.1     GENERAL INDEMNITIES

         Ideal shall (or will procure that an Obligor will) indemnify on demand
         each of the Beneficiaries against any funding or other cost, loss
         (including any foreign exchange contract loss incurred by any of them),
         expense or liability which it may sustain or incur, directly or
         indirectly, as a result of:

         19.1.1   a Loan not being made by reason of any of the conditions set
                  out in Schedule 2 not being satisfied or any Borrower
                  cancelling or purporting to cancel a Utilisation Notice; or

         19.1.2   the occurrence of any Default; or

         19.1.3   the receipt or recovery by it (or the Agent on its behalf) of
                  all or any part of its share of any Loan or unpaid sum other
                  than on the last day of any Interest Period relating to that
                  Loan or unpaid sum.

19.2     BREAK COSTS

         Ideal's liability under clause 19.1.3 shall include the amount (if any)
         by which (i) the additional interest which would have been payable
         under this Agreement on the amount so received or recovered had it been
         received or recovered by the relevant party on the last day of the
         relevant Interest Period exceeds (ii) the amount of interest which, in
         the opinion of the Beneficiary concerned, would have been payable to
         such Beneficiary on the last day of that Interest Period in respect of
         a deposit denominated in the currency of the Loan or unpaid sum in
         question equal to the amount so received or recovered placed by it with
         a prime bank in London for a period starting on the second business day
         following the date of such receipt or recovery and ending on the last
         day of that Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt (but without
         prejudice to their obligations to pay break costs), neither Ideal nor
         any other relevant Obligor shall be liable to compensate any
         Beneficiary for any loss of Applicable Margin if any amount is repaid,
         prepaid or cancelled by virtue of the operation of clauses 9.3 or
         12.1.2.

19.3     CURRENCY INDEMNITY

         Any amount received or recovered by any Beneficiary in respect of any
         sum expressed to be due to it from any Obligor under any Finance
         Document in a currency other than the currency (the "CONTRACTUAL
         CURRENCY") in which such sum is so expressed to be due (whether as a
         result of, or of the enforcement of, any judgment or order of a court
         or tribunal of any jurisdiction, the winding-up of such Obligor or
         otherwise) shall only constitute a discharge to such Obligor to the
         extent of the amount of the contractual currency that the recipient is
         able, in accordance with its usual practice, to purchase with the
         amount of the currency so received or recovered on the date of receipt
         or recovery (or, if later, the first date on which such purchase is
         practicable). If the amount of the contractual currency so purchased is
         less than the amount of the contractual currency so expressed to be
         due, such Obligor shall indemnify the

                                       84
<PAGE>

         recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result, including the
         cost of making any such purchase.

19.4     INDEMNITY TO THE AGENT

         Ideal shall (or shall procure that an Obligor shall) promptly indemnify
         the Agent against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Agent
         (other than any loss occasioned by the gross negligence or wilful
         misconduct of the Agent) as a result of:

         19.4.1   investigating any event which it reasonably believes is a
                  Default; or

         19.4.2   entering into or performing any foreign exchange contract for
                  the purposes of any Loan being made in a Foreign Currency; or

         19.4.3   acting or relying on any notice, request or instruction which
                  it believes to be genuine, correct and appropriately
                  authorised.

19.5     NATURE OF INDEMNITIES

         Each of the indemnities in this clause 19 constitutes a separate and
         independent obligation from the other obligations in this Agreement,
         shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall
         apply irrespective of any time or indulgence granted by the Agent or
         any Lender and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
         any order, judgment, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect
         of any sum due under this Agreement or any other judgment or order.

20       PAYMENTS

20.1     CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT AND PAYMENT

         Sterling is the currency of account and payment for all sums at any
         time due from the Borrower under or in connection with any of the
         Finance Documents (including damages) provided that (i) each repayment
         of a Loan or a part thereof shall be made in the currency in which such
         Loan is denominated at the time of that repayment; (ii) each payment of
         interest shall be made in the currency in which the sum in respect of
         which such interest is payable is denominated; (iii) each payment in
         respect of costs and expenses shall be made in the currency in which
         the same were incurred; and (iv) any amount expected to be payable in a
         currency other than sterling shall be paid in that other currency.

20.2     PAYMENTS BY THE BORROWER AND THE LENDERS

         On each date on which this Agreement requires an amount to be paid by
         any Obligor or any of the Lenders to the Agent, that Obligor or, as the
         case may be, such Lender shall make the same available to the Agent:

         20.2.1   where such amount is denominated in sterling, by payment in
                  sterling and in same day funds (or in such other funds as may

                  in

                                       85

                  16-50-50, Attn: Loans Service (or as the Agent may otherwise
                  specify for this purpose); or

         20.2.2   where such amount is denominated in a Foreign Currency (other
                  than euro), by payment in such Foreign Currency and in
                  immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds to
                  such account with such bank in the principal financial centre
                  of the country of such Foreign Currency as the Agent may
                  specify for this purpose; or

         20.2.3   where such amount is denominated in euro, such sum shall be
                  made available to the Agent by payment in euro and in
                  immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds to
                  such account with such bank in such principal financial centre
                  in such participating member state of the European Union or in
                  London as the Agent shall from time to time nominate for this
                  purpose.

20.3     PAYMENTS BY THE AGENT

         Save as otherwise provided herein, each payment received by the Agent
         for the account of another person pursuant to clause 20.2 shall be made
         available by the Agent (subject, without any liability therefor, for
         delays outside the Agent's control in crediting cleared funds) to such
         other person (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility
         Office) for value the same day (provided that such payment has been
         received by the Agent by no later than 12.00 noon) by transfer to such
         account of such person with such bank in the principal financial centre
         of the country of the currency of such payment as such person shall
         have previously notified to the Agent or (in the case of a Borrower) in
         the agreed currency denomination to the account of that Borrower
         specified in the Utilisation Notice.

20.4     PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS

         If any payment of principal, interest, premium or other sum to be made
         hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a business day,
         the due date of payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
         business day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable
         interest rate during such extension (unless that next succeeding
         business day falls in the following calendar month in which case the
         due date of payment shall be the immediately preceding business day).

20.5     IMPRACTICABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS

         If, at any time, it shall become impracticable (by reason of any action
         of any governmental authority or any change in law, exchange control
         regulations or any similar event) for any Obligor to make any payments
         hereunder in the manner specified in clause 20.2, then that Obligor may
         agree with each or any of the Lenders to make alternative arrangements
         for the payment direct to such Lender of amounts due to such Lender
         hereunder provided that, in the absence

                                       86
<PAGE>

         of any such agreement with any Lender, that Obligor shall be obliged to
         make all payments due to such Lender in the manner specified in this
         Agreement. Upon reaching such agreement the relevant Obligor and such
         Lender shall immediately notify the Agent and shall thereafter promptly
         notify the Agent of all payments made direct to such Lender.

20.6     NO SET-OFF OR COUNTERCLAIM

         All payments made by an Obligor under this Agreement shall be made free
         and clear of and without any deduction for or on account of any set-off
         or counterclaim.

20.7     REFUNDING OF PAYMENTS

         Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under this Agreement for account
         of another person, the Agent shall not be obliged to (but may) make the
         same available to that other person until it has been able to establish
         to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum. If and to
         the extent that it does so but it proves to be the case that it had not
         actually received the sum which it paid out, then, the person to whom
         the Agent made that sum available shall on request refund it to the
         Agent and that person or (at the option of the Agent) the person by
         whom that sum should have been made available shall on request pay to
         the Agent the amount (as certified by the Agent) which will indemnify
         the Agent against any funding or other cost, loss, expense or liability
         which it may have sustained or incurred as a result of paying out that
         sum before receiving it.

20.8     DEBIT TO LOAN ACCOUNT

         The Agent is hereby authorised to debit all Swingline Loans and all
         Reference Rate Revolving Loans and interest thereon to a loan account
         or accounts denominated in the currency denomination of each such
         Swingline Loan maintained with the Agent. All fees, commissions, costs,
         expenses and other charges under or pursuant to the Finance Documents
         and all payments made and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent
         and/or the Lenders pursuant to the Finance Documents will be debited to
         such loan account(s) as of the date due from the relevant Borrower or
         the date paid or incurred by the Agent and/or the Lenders, as the case
         may be.

20.9     CHANGE OF CURRENCY TO EURO

         With effect from the date (if any) upon which sterling is converted
         into euro in accordance with EMU legislation:

         20.9.1   REDENOMINATION: each obligation under this Agreement of any
                  party to this Agreement which, up to such time, had been
                  denominated in sterling shall be redenominated into euro in
                  accordance with EMU legislation provided that, if and to the
                  extent that any EMU legislation provides that an amount
                  denominated either in euro or in sterling as a national
                  currency unit of the euro can be paid by the debtor either in
                  euro or in that national currency

                                       87
<PAGE>

                  unit, each party to this Agreement shall be entitled to pay or
                  repay any such amount either in euro or in sterling as such
                  national currency unit;

         20.9.2   ROUNDING: without prejudice and in addition to any method of
                  conversion or rounding prescribed by any EMU legislation and
                  without prejudice to the respective liabilities for
                  indebtedness of any Obligor to the Beneficiaries and the
                  Beneficiaries to any Obligor under or pursuant to this
                  Agreement each reference in this Agreement to a minimum amount
                  (or an integral multiple thereof) in sterling to be paid to or
                  by the Agent and/or the Lenders shall be replaced by a
                  reference to such reasonably comparable and convenient amount
                  (or an integral multiple thereof) in euro as the Agent (after
                  consultation with Ideal but without prejudice to its rights
                  under this clause 20.9.2) may from time to time specify; and

         20.9.3   CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES: each provision of this Agreement shall
                  be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the
                  Agent may (after consultation with Ideal but without prejudice
                  to its rights under this clause 20.9.3)from time to time
                  specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the
                  changeover of sterling to euro.

20.10    ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION TO LENDERS

         If the amount received by the Agent from an Obligor (or, as the case
         may be, from the Security Trustee pursuant to the exercise by the
         Security Trustee of any rights or powers it may have pursuant to the
         Security Documents) on any date is less than the total sum due under
         this Agreement on that date, the Agent shall apply that amount in or
         towards payment of the following sums in the following order:

         20.10.1  first, in or towards payment of any sum then due to the Agent
                  in its capacity as such;

         20.10.2  secondly, in or towards payment of any sum then due to the
                  Arranger in its capacity as such;

         20.10.3  thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any sums (other

21       SET-OFF

         Each Obligor authorises any other party to this Agreement at any time
         after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and without
         prior notice to

                                       88

         that Obligor to apply any credit balance (whether or not then due) to
         which that Obligor is at any time beneficially entitled on any account
         at any office of that party in or towards satisfaction of any sum then
         due from it to that party under this Agreement and unpaid and for this
         purpose to purchase with the monies standing to the credit of any such
         account such other currencies as may be necessary to effect such
         application (but so that nothing in this clause 21 shall be effective
         to create a charge). No party shall be obliged to exercise any of its
         rights under this clause which shall be without prejudice to and in
         addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or
         other right to which it is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by
         operation of law, contract or otherwise).

22       FEES

22.1     UNUSED LINE FEE

         For every month during the term of this Agreement, Ideal shall (or
         shall procure that another Obligor shall) pay the Agent for the account
         of the Lenders a fee (the "UNUSED LINE FEE") in an amount equal to
         0.25% per annum, multiplied by the average daily amount by which the
         Total Commitments exceed the sum of the sterling equivalent of (i) the
         average daily outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans and Swingline
         Loans during such month (with the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans
         and Swingline Loans calculated for this purpose by applying payments
         immediately upon receipt) and (ii) the maximum contingent liability of
         the Issuer under each Letter of Credit and Guarantee or, if any demand
         is made under any Letter of Credit or Guarantee, the average daily
         amount outstanding under any account to which any such payment made
         thereunder is debited. Such fee shall be calculated on the basis of a
         year of three hundred sixty five (365) days and actual days elapsed,
         and shall be payable to the Agent on the first day of each month
         following the Closing Date and on the termination of this Agreement, in
         each case with respect to the prior month or portion thereof.

22.2     ARRANGEMENT FEE

         Ideal shall pay to the Arranger for its own account an arrangement fee

22.3     COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT FEE

         Ideal will pay the Agent for its own account a fee of an amount set out
         in a letter of even date addressed by the Agent to Ideal (the

         deemed to have accrued due and become payable in full on the Closing
         Date but the Agent agrees, subject to clause 29.3, that such fee shall
         be paid in equal instalments on the Closing Date and on the first day
         of each calendar month thereafter prior to the termination of this
         Agreement.

                                       89

22.4     AUDIT FEE

         Ideal shall pay to the Agent for its own account an audit fee of L500

         pocket expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any such
         inspection.

22.5     LETTER OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEE FEE

         Ideal agrees to pay (or procure that the relevant Borrower shall pay)
         to the Agent for account of the Issuer a fee (the "LETTER OF CREDIT AND
         GUARANTEE FEE") equal to 2.25% per annum of the face amount of each
         Letter of Credit or maximum contingent liability under each Guarantee
         issued by the Issuer, plus all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
         incurred by the Issuer (other than where such fees, costs or expenses
         are indemnified pursuant to clause 6.11.2) in connection with the
         application for, issue of, or amendment to any Letter of Credit or
         Guarantee, such Letter of Credit and Guarantee Fee to be calculated on
         the basis of a year of 365 days and actual days elapsed and to be
         payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month following any
         month in which a Letter of Credit or Guarantee was issued and/or in
         which a Letter of Credit or Guarantee remains outstanding and, to the
         extent that it has been calculated by reference to a Letter of Credit
         or Guarantee denominated other than in sterling, shall be satisfied by
         payment of the sterling equivalent of the amount so calculated. Any
         out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Issuer in
         connection with the application for, issue of, or amendment to any
         Letter of Credit or Guarantee shall be payable at the time of such
         application, issue or amendment.

         specified in the letter dated on or about the date of this Agreement
         from the Agent and the Security Trustee respectively to Ideal. The full
         amount of such fees shall be deemed to have accrued due and become
         payable in full on the Closing Date but the Agent and the Security
         Trustee each agree, subject to clause 29.3, that such fees shall be
         paid in equal instalments on the Closing Date and on the first day of
         each calendar month thereafter prior to the termination of this
         Agreement.

22.7     ADDITIONAL MONITORING AND ADMINISTRATION FEE

         Without prejudice to any other rights that the Agent, the Security
         Trustee or any of the Beneficiaries may have at such time under this
         Agreement or any other Finance Document, Ideal agrees that, upon the
         appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver,
         trustee, examiner or any other similar officer or office holder of any
         Obligor or of any or all of the assets of any Obligor or upon an order
         being made for the winding-up, liquidation or dissolution of any
         Obligor (the date of such event or occurrence being the "INSOLVENCY
         DATE"), Ideal shall become liable to pay forthwith to the Agent for its
         own account, an additional monitoring and administrative fee (the

                                       90
<PAGE>

         "ADDITIONAL MONITORING AND ADMINISTRATION FEE") in an amount equal to
         one per cent. (1%) of the higher of (a) the aggregate total of all
         Accounts then due and owing from any Account Debtor to the Borrowers
         (as determined by the Agent by reference to the most recent information
         provided to it under clause 15.2 and clause 16.4) and (b) the Total
         Commitments, in each case, as at the Insolvency Date.

23       PRO RATA SHARING

23.1     If a Beneficiary (a "RECOVERING BENEFICIARY") receives or recovers any
         amount from an Obligor other than in accordance with clause 20 and
         applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance Documents then:

         23.1.1   the Recovering Beneficiary shall, within three business days,
                  notify details of the receipt or recovery to the Agent;

         23.1.2   the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is
                  in excess of the amount the Recovering Beneficiary would have
                  been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by
                  the Agent and distributed in accordance with clause 20,
                  without taking account of any tax which would be imposed on
                  the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or
                  distribution; and

         23.1.3   the Recovering Beneficiary shall, within three business days
                  of demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the
                  "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or recovery less any
                  amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the
                  Recovering Beneficiary as its share of any payment to be made,
                  in accordance with clause 20.11.

23.2     REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

         The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
         relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Beneficiaries (other
         than the Recovering Beneficiary) in accordance with clause 18.9.

23.3     RECOVERING BENEFICIARY'S RIGHTS

23.3.1   On a distribution by the Agent under clause 23.2 the Recovering
         Beneficiary will be subrogated to the rights of the Beneficiaries which
         have shared in the redistribution.

23.3.2   If and to the extent that the Recovering Beneficiary is not able to
         rely on its rights under sub-clause 23.3.1 above, the relevant Obligor
         shall be liable to the Recovering Beneficiary for a debt equal to the
         Sharing Payment which is immediately due and payable.

23.4     REVERSAL OF REDISTRIBUTION

         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Beneficiary becomes repayable and is repaid by that
         Recovering Beneficiary, then:

                                       91
<PAGE>

         23.4.1   each Beneficiary which has received a share of the relevant
                  Sharing Payment pursuant to clause 23.2 shall, upon request of
                  the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of that Recovering
                  Beneficiary an amount equal to the appropriate part of its
                  share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is
                  necessary to reimburse that Recovering Beneficiary for its
                  proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that
                  Recovering Beneficiary is required to pay); and

         23.4.2   that Recovering Beneficiary's rights of subrogation in respect
                  of any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant
                  Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing Beneficiary for the
                  amount so reimbursed.

23.5     EXCEPTIONS

23.5.1   This clause 23 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering
         Beneficiary would not, after making any payment pursuant to this clause
         23, have a valid and enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

23.5.2   A Recovering Beneficiary is not obliged to share with any other
         Beneficiary any amount which the Recovering Beneficiary has received or
         recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

         (a)      it notified that other Beneficiary of the legal or arbitration
                  proceedings; and

         (b)      that other Beneficiary had an opportunity to participate in
                  those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as
                  soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did
                  not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

         incurred in or in connection with the termination of this Agreement or

24.5     INDEMNITY BY BANKS

         If Ideal fails to perform any of its obligations under this clause 24,
         each Lender shall (i) in the proportion borne by its Outstandings to

         are no Outstandings, in the proportion borne by its Commitment to the

         by its Commitment to the Total Commitments immediately before they were
         cancelled (in each case determined, and as at such time as may be
         specified, by the Agent), indemnify the Agent, the Security Trustee and
         the other Lenders against any loss incurred by any of them as a result
         of such failure (save for any failure caused by the gross negligence or
         wilful default of any such party) and Ideal shall forthwith reimburse

25       CALCULATIONS AND EVIDENCE OF DEBT

25.1     BASIS OF CALCULATION

         Interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be calculated in the
         case of sterling on the basis of a year of 365 days (or, in the case of
         dollars or euros, 360 days or, in any case where market practice
         differs, in accordance with market practice) and the actual number of
         days elapsed (not counting within any Interest Period the last day of
         that Interest Period). If the basis of accrual of interest or any other
         amount expressed in this Agreement in respect of

                                       93
<PAGE>

         sterling shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the
         London Interbank Market for the basis of accrual of interest or any
         other amount in respect of euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced
         by such convention or practice with effect from the date (if any) of
         conversion of sterling into euro in accordance with EMU legislation.

25.2     FAILURE TO SUPPLY QUOTATIONS

         In on any occasion a Reference Bank or a Lender fails to supply the
         Agent with a quotation required of it under any provision of this

         determined from those quotations which are supplied to the Agent.

25.3     LOAN ACCOUNTS

         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
         accounts evidencing the amounts from time to time lent by and owing to
         it under this Agreement.

25.4     CONTROL ACCOUNT

         The Agent shall maintain on its books a control account or accounts in
         which shall be recorded (i) the amount of any Loan or unpaid sum made
         or arising under this Agreement and each Lender's share in such Loan or

         showing all amounts from time to time lent by and owing to any of them
         under this Agreement and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement
         and the other Finance Documents shall be admissible in any action or
         proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute prima facie proof
         thereof (in the absence of manifest error), irrespective of whether any
         such obligations are also evidenced by any other instrument.

25.6     MONTHLY STATEMENTS

         The Agent will provide to Ideal a monthly statement of Loans, payments
         and other transactions pursuant to this Agreement. Such statement shall
         be deemed correct, accurate, and binding on the Obligors and as an

         made as provided in clause 20.7 and corrections of errors).

25.7     CERTIFICATES

         A certificate by the Agent or any other Finance Party as to any sum
         payable by it under this Agreement or any other Finance Document shall,

                                       94
<PAGE>

         of manifest error, be conclusive for the purposes of this Agreement and

         All consideration (including interest and fees) payable under a Finance
         Document by the Borrower to a Beneficiary shall be deemed to be
         exclusive of any VAT. If VAT is chargeable, the Borrower shall pay to
         the Beneficiary (in addition to and at the same time as paying the
         consideration) an amount equal to the amount of that VAT. Where a
         Finance Document requires the Borrower to reimburse a Beneficiary for
         any costs or expenses, the Borrower shall also at the same time pay and
         indemnify that Finance Party against all VAT incurred by that Finance
         Party in respect of the costs and expenses.

26       THE AGENT, THE ARRANGER, THE SECURITY TRUSTEE AND THE LENDERS

26.1     APPOINTMENT

         Agent to act as its agent in connection with this Agreement and the
         Agent and each of the Lenders hereby appoints the Security Trustee to
         act as its trustee under and in relation to the Security Documents
         pursuant to this Agreement and to hold the Trust Property as trustee
         for the Beneficiaries on the trusts and other terms contained in the
         Security Documents and each Beneficiary hereby irrevocably authorises
         the Agent and the Security Trustee to exercise such rights, powers and
         discretions as are specifically delegated to the Agent or, as the case
         may be, the Security Trustee by the terms of this Agreement and the
         Security Documents together with all such rights, powers and
         discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto provided that the
         Agent may not begin any legal action or proceeding in the name of a
         Lender without its consent.

26.2     ROLE OF THE ARRANGER

         Except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, the Arranger
         has no obligations of any kind to any other party under or in
         connection with any Finance Document.

26.3     RELATIONSHIPS

         The Agent in its capacity as such is agent for the Security Trustee and
         the Lenders and shall not in any respect be the agent of any Borrower
         by virtue of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute
         the Agent or the Arranger a trustee or fiduciary for the Security
         Trustee, any Lender, any Borrower or any other person.

26.4     RIGHTS OF THE AGENT AND THE SECURITY TRUSTEE

                                       95
<PAGE>

         26.4.1   assume that any representation made by any Obligor in
                  connection with any of the Finance Documents is true, that no
                  Event of Default has occurred and that no Obligor is in breach
                  of or default under its obligations under any of the Finance
                  Documents, in each such case unless it has actual knowledge or
                  actual notice to the contrary;

         26.4.2   assume that the Facility Office of each Lender is that set out
                  under its name at the end of this Agreement or, in the case of
                  a Transferee, at the end of the Transfer Certificate to which
                  it is a party as Transferee or, in the case of a Lender which
                  is an assignee or other successor of another Lender or former
                  Lender, the office notified to the Agent by the assignee or

                  person.

26.7     CREDIT ASSESSMENT

                  connection with any Finance Document or the transactions
                  contemplated in any Relevant Agreement (whether or not such
                  information has been or is at any time hereafter circulated to
                  it by the Agent or the Security Trustee including any
                  contained in any information memorandum or similar document
                  prepared in connection with any proposed syndication of the
                  Facilities); or

                  operations, financial condition, prospects, creditworthiness,
                  status or affairs of any Borrower, other Obligor or Group
                  Company or any other person.

26.8     THE AGENT AND THE SECURITY TRUSTEE AS LENDERS

         The Agent and the Security Trustee shall each have the same rights and
         powers with respect to its Commitment and Outstandings (if any) as any
         other Lender and may exercise those rights and powers as if it were not
         also acting as the Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee.

26.9     INDEMNITY

         Each Lender agrees that it shall, from time to time on demand of the
         Agent and/or Security Trustee, indemnify the Agent and/or Security
         Trustee (to the extent not reimbursed by Ideal or any other Obligor and
         without prejudice to any liability of the Borrower under this
         Agreement) (i) in the proportion borne by its Outstandings to the
         aggregate of the Outstandings of all the Lenders; or (ii) if there are
         no Outstandings, in the proportion borne by its Commitment to the Total
         Commitments; or (iii) if there are no Outstandings and the Total
         Commitments have been cancelled at such time, in the proportion borne
         by its Commitment to the Total Commitments immediately before they were
         cancelled (in each case determined, and as at such time as may be
         specified, by the Agent), against all costs, claims, expenses
         (including legal fees) and liabilities which it may sustain or incur in
         connection with this Agreement or the performance of its obligations
         and responsibilities under this Agreement save to the extent that they
         are sustained or incurred by reason of the gross negligence or wilful
         misconduct of the Agent or the Security Trustee or any of its personnel
         or agents and Ideal shall (or shall procure that an Obligor shall)
         forthwith reimburse each Lender for any payment made by it pursuant to
         this clause 26.9.

26.10    RESIGNATION

26.10.1  RESIGNATION: Each of the Agent and the Security Trustee may following
         consultation with Ideal and the Lenders resign its appointment under
         any of the Finance Documents at any time by giving not less than thirty
         days' notice in writing to that effect to each of the other parties to
         this Agreement provided that such resignation shall not become
         effective until a successor to the Agent or, as the case may be, the
         Security Trustee has been appointed and accepted its appointment in
         accordance with the following provisions of this clause 26.10 and, in
         the case of the Security Trustee, all necessary documents have been
         entered into to ensure that the benefit of the Security Documents is
         held by such successor.

26.10.2  APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR: If the Agent or, as the case may be, the
         Security Trustee gives notice of its resignation the Majority Lenders
         may appoint a successor. If the Majority Lenders have not within sixty
         days after such notice of resignation appointed a successor to the
         Agent or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee (which shall, in
         either such case, be a reputable and experienced bank with an office in
         London) which shall have accepted such appointment, the retiring Agent
         or, as the case may be, Security Trustee shall have the right to
         appoint such a successor itself.

26.10.3  DISCHARGE: If a successor to the Agent or, as the case may be, Security
         Trustee is appointed under the provisions of this clause 26.10 then the
         retiring Agent or, as the case may be, retiring Security Trustee shall
         be discharged from any further obligations under the Finance Documents
         but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this
         clause 26 and its successor and each of the other parties to this
         Agreement shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves
         as they would have had if such successor had been a party to this
         Agreement.

26.10.4  DISCLOSURE: The retiring Agent or, as the case may be, Security
         Trustee, shall make available to its successor such documents and
         records and provide such assistance as the successor may reasonably
         request for the purpose of performing its functions under the Finance
         Documents. Notwithstanding any provision in any Finance Document to the
         contrary, neither the Agent nor the Security Trustee shall be obliged
         to disclose to any person any confidential or other information if the
         disclosure would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach
         of any law or fiduciary duty.

         Each Beneficiary hereby confirms its approval of the Finance Documents
         and any security created or to be created pursuant thereto and hereby
         authorises, empowers and directs the Security Trustee (by itself or

         its behalf.

         Agreement.

27.3     SUMS RECEIVED BY THE SECURITY TRUSTEE

         Pending distribution under clause 27.4, the Security Trustee shall, if
         reasonably practicable, place any sum received, recovered or held by it
         in respect of the Trust Property in an interest bearing suspense
         account with a bank or financial institution in the name of or under
         the control of the Security Trustee. The interest paid on such account
         shall be credited to the relevant account.

27.4     APPLICATION OF SUMS RECEIVED

         Subject to the other provisions of this clause 27, the Security Trustee
         shall apply all amounts standing to the credit of any account referred
         to in clause 27.3 and any other amounts realised pursuant to the
         exercise of any rights or powers it might have pursuant to any of the
         Security Documents:

         27.4.1   first, in the payment of any costs, charges and expenses of or
                  incidental to the appointment of any Receiver pursuant to the
                  Security Documents, the payment of his remuneration and the
                  payment and discharge of any other Expenses incurred by or on
                  behalf of the Receiver;

         27.4.2   secondly, in or towards payment of any debts or claims which

<PAGE>

                  only to the extent to which such debts or claims have such
                  preference;

         27.4.3   thirdly, in or towards payment and discharge pro rata of any
                  Secured Obligations then due, owing or incurred to the
                  Security Trustee, in its capacity as Security Trustee (and not
                  in any other capacity) for its own account; and

         27.4.4   fourthly, in payment to the Agent to be applied by the Agent
                  in or towards payment and discharge of the balance of the
                  Secured Obligations (if any) in accordance with the provisions
                  of clause 20.10 provided that, when distributing sums in
                  accordance with this clause 27.4, the Security Trustee will
                  treat any contingent liability as an actual liability and
                  distribute to the party entitled thereto accordingly. Any such
                  party receiving sums in respect of a contingent liability
                  shall place such sums on deposit with such bank (not being a
                  bank entitled to exercise any right of set-off or combination
                  or consolidation of accounts or having the benefit of any
                  encumbrance over such deposit) and on such terms as the
                  Security Trustee may approve and, if such contingent liability
                  shall fail to mature, shall return such sums (together with
                  any interest earned thereon) to the Security Trustee for
                  distribution in accordance with the terms of this clause 27.4.

27.5     SECURITY TRUSTEE'S SOLE RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE

         No Obligor shall have the right to appropriate any payment to, or other
         sum received, recovered or held by, the Security Trustee in or towards
         payment of any particular part of the Secured Obligations and the
         Security Trustee shall have the exclusive right to appropriate any such
         payment or other sum as provided in this clause 27.

27.6     TIMING OF DISTRIBUTION

         Distributions by the Security Trustee shall be made at such times as
         the Security Trustee in its absolute discretion determines to be as
         soon as is reasonably practicable, having regard to all relevant
         circumstances, and the Security Trustee shall have no liability
         whatsoever for any loss or damage which any Beneficiary might sustain
         as a consequence of the timing of any such distribution.

27.7     DATE FOR CALCULATION OF SECURED OBLIGATIONS

         For the purpose of any distribution by the Security Trustee, the
         Security Trustee may, by notice to the Beneficiaries, fix a date (being
         not earlier than the date of such notice) as at which the amount of the
         Secured Obligations are to be calculated.

<PAGE>

27.8     CERTIFICATE FROM BENEFICIARY

         For the purposes of determining the amount of any payment to be made to
         any Beneficiary pursuant hereto the Security Trustee shall be entitled
         to call for and rely upon (and it is the intention of the parties that
         the Security Trustee shall rely upon) a certificate from the relevant
         Beneficiary of the amount and nature of any amount due, owing or
         incurred to the relevant Beneficiary at the date fixed by the Security
         Trustee for such purpose and as to such other matters as the Security
         Trustee may deem necessary or desirable to enable it to make a
         distribution.

27.9     MISTAKEN PAYMENTS

         If the Security Trustee makes any distribution contrary to any of the
         provisions of this clause 27 or any distribution made by it otherwise
         transpires to have been invalid or the Security Trustee and the person
         receiving such distribution agree that it should be refunded, the
         recipient shall, to the extent that no charge is thereby created, hold
         the proceeds of that distribution on trust to repay to the Security
         Trustee forthwith on demand. If the trust imposed by this clause 28.9
         cannot be given effect to for whatever reason, including the possible
         creation thereby of a charge, the relevant recipient shall, if and when
         so requested by the Security Trustee, pay an amount equal to the
         proceeds of that distribution required to be held on trust to the
         Security Trustee.

27.10    SUPPLEMENT TO TRUSTEE ACTS 1925 & 2000

         By way of supplement to the Trustee Acts 1925 & 2000 it is expressly
         declared as follows:

         27.10.1  EXPERTS: the Security Trustee may, in relation to the Security
                  Documents, act or rely upon the opinion or advice of, or any

                  broker, auctioneer, accountant or other expert commissioned by
                  the Security Trustee and shall not be responsible to anyone
                  for any loss or damage occasioned by so acting or relying. Any
                  such opinion, advice or information may be sent or obtained by
                  letter, fax, e-mail or otherwise and the Security Trustee will
                  not be liable to anyone for acting in good faith on any
                  opinion, advice or information purporting to be conveyed by
                  such means even if it contains some error or is not authentic
                  or validly signed;

         27.10.2  CERTIFICATE OF IDEAL: the Security Trustee may call for and
                  may accept as sufficient evidence a certificate of Ideal
                  signed by any director of Ideal to the effect that any
                  particular dealing, transaction, step or thing is, in the
                  opinion of such director, suitable or expedient or as to any
                  other fact or matter upon which the Security Trustee may, in
                  the exercise of any of its rights, powers or duties hereunder,
                  require to be satisfied and the Security Trustee need not call
                  for further evidence and will not be responsible to anyone for
                  any loss or damage occasioned by acting on any such
                  certificate;

         Registration Rules 1925 as the joint proprietor of any mortgage or
         charge created pursuant to any Finance Document and accordingly

         sole name as agent and trustee for the Beneficiaries and hereby
         requests HM Land Registry to register the Security Trustee as the sole
         proprietor of any such mortgage or charge.

         be entitled to deal with each of the Beneficiaries by dealing
         exclusively with the Agent.

27.13    INDEMNITY PROVISIONS

         The Security Trustee and every attorney, agent or other person
         appointed by it under any of the Finance Documents may indemnify itself

         incurred by any of them in relation to or arising out of the taking or
         holding of the Trust Property, the exercise or purported exercise of

         provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

27.14    APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL SECURITY TRUSTEES

         The Security Trustee may at any time appoint any person (whether or not
         a trust corporation) to act either as a separate trustee or as a
         co-trustee jointly with it (i) if it considers such appointment to be
         in the interests of the Beneficiaries or (ii) for the purposes of
         conforming to any legal requirements, restrictions or conditions which
         the Security Trustee deems relevant for the purposes hereof and the
         Security Trustee shall give prior notice to the Obligors of any such
         appointment. Any person so appointed shall (subject to the provisions
         of the Finance Documents) have such powers, authorities and discretions

         such person by the instrument of appointment and shall have the same
         rights, powers, discretions and benefits under the Finance Documents as

         Security Trustee shall have power in like manner to remove any person
         so appointed. Such remuneration as the Security Trustee may pay to any
         person so appointed, and any costs, charges and expenses incurred by
         such person in performing its functions pursuant to such

         appointment, shall for the purposes hereof be treated as costs, charges
         and expenses incurred by the Security Trustee in performing its
         function as trustee hereunder.

28       ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS

28.1     BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of each

         successors and assigns.

         No Obligor shall be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its

         after consultation with Ideal but without the prior consent of Ideal or
         any other party to this Agreement assign all or any of its rights under
         this Agreement to any bank or financial institution which is a
         Qualifying Lender or transfer in accordance with clause 28.4 all or any
         of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any such
         Qualifying Lender.

28.3.2   If any Lender assigns all or any of its rights under this Agreement in
         accordance with clause 28.3.1 then, unless and until the assignee has
         agreed with the Agent, the Security Trustee and the other Lenders that
         it shall be under the same obligations towards each of them as it would
         have been under if it had been a party to this Agreement, the Agent,
         the Security Trustee and the other Lenders shall not be obliged to
         recognise such assignee as having the rights against each of them which
         it would have had if it had been a party to this Agreement.

28.4     TRANSFER CERTIFICATE

         If any Lender wishes to transfer all or any of its rights and

         any Commitment in respect of the Revolving Facility and/or its
         Outstandings as contemplated in clause 28.3.1, then such transfer may
         be effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed and duly
         executed Transfer Certificate but only if it relates to its Commitment
         and/or its Outstandings in respect of all the Facilities in which it is
         participating at that time. Subject to clause 28.5, the Agent shall, on
         receipt of such certificate, countersign it and subject to the terms of

         Certificate:

         28.4.1   each Obligor and the relevant Lender shall, to the extent
                  provided in such Transfer Certificate, each be released from
                  further obligations to each other under this Agreement and
                  their respective rights against each other shall be cancelled
                  (such rights and

<PAGE>

                  obligations being referred to in this clause 28 as "DISCHARGED

                  Certificate shall each assume obligations towards, and acquire
                  rights from, each other which differ from the discharged
                  rights and obligations only insofar as such Obligor and the
                  Transferee have assumed and acquired the same in place of such
                  Obligor and that Lender;

         28.4.3   the Transferee and the other parties to this Agreement (other
                  than the Obligor) shall acquire the same rights and assume the
                  same obligations between themselves as they would have
                  acquired and assumed had such Transferee been an original
                  party to this Agreement as a Lender with the rights and
                  obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of such
                  transfer (and, to that extent, the transferor Lender and such

         Certificate received by it to Ideal.

         The Agent shall be fully entitled to rely on any Transfer Certificate

         purportedly signed on behalf of the Lender and the Transferee and shall
         have no liability or responsibility to any party as a consequence of
         placing reliance on and acting in accordance with any such Transfer

         transferor or assigning Lender) the names, interests and administrative
         details from time to time of the Lenders having rights and/or
         obligations under this Agreement. The Agent shall make the register
         available for inspection by any

         this Agreement such information about any Borrower, any other Obligor
         or any other person as it thinks fit.

28.10    INCREASED PAYMENTS FOLLOWING ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER

         If at the time of, or immediately after, any assignment or transfer by
         a Lender or any change in its Facility Office, circumstances are such
         that any Obligor would be obliged to pay to an assignee, Transferee
         (or, in the case of a change of Facility Office, the relevant Lender)
         under clause 10 or 11 any sum in excess of the sum (if any) which it
         would have been obliged to pay to that Lender under the relevant clause
         in the absence of that assignment, transfer or change, that Obligor
         shall not be obliged to pay that excess.

34       DUTCH PARALLEL DEBT

         Without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and for the

         security rights granted and to be granted by any of the Obligors under
         or pursuant to the Security Documents, each of the Beneficiaries hereby
         acknowledges and consents to BMEBV and to any other Obligor
         incorporated or established under the laws of the Netherlands (each, a
         "DUTCH OBLIGOR") that are at any time party to any Security Document,
         undertaking to pay to Bank of America, National Association, acting in
         its capacity as Security Trustee, amounts (i) equal to the amounts due
         from time to time by the Obligors to the Beneficiaries in respect of
         the Secured Obligations and (ii) due and payable at the same time as
         the corresponding amounts in respect of the Secured Obligations are or
         shall be due and payable (such payment undertaking and the obligations
         and liabilities resulting therefrom being, the "PARALLEL DEBT"). The
         Beneficiaries hereby agree that the Parallel Debt is a claim of Bank of
         America, National Association (in its capacity as Security Trustee)
         which is independent and separate from, and without prejudice to, the
         claims of Beneficiaries in respect of the Secured Obligations, and is
         not a claim which is held jointly with the Beneficiaries provided that,
         to the extent any amounts are paid to Bank of America, National
         Association under the Parallel Debt or that Bank of America, National
         Association otherwise receives monies in payment of the Parallel Debt,
         the total amount due and payable in respect of the Secured Obligations
         shall be decreased as if the said amounts were received directly in
         payment of the outstanding Secured Obligations. Bank of America,
         National Association, acting in its capacity as Security Trustee,
         hereby agrees to transfer to the Agent for the benefit of the
         Beneficiaries all proceeds that it receives or recovers from any Dutch
         Obligor in connection with any enforcement action taken under or
         pursuant to any Security Document.

                                   SCHEDULE 5

                             MANDATORY COST FORMULAE

1        The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate
         Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the
         Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either
         case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions)
         or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.

2        On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible
         thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate
         (the "ADDITIONAL COST RATE") for each Lender, in accordance with the
         paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the
         Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates
         (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender
         in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per
         annum.

3        The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office
         in a participating member state will be the percentage notified by the
         Lender to the Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender
         in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of the
         cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all
         Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum
         reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans
         made from that Facility Office.

4        The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office
         in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

         4.1      in relation to a sterling Loan:

                  (AB + C(B - D)E * 0.01)/(100 - (A + C)) per cent per annum

         4.2      in relation to a Loan in any currency other than sterling:

                  (E * 0.01)/300 per cent per annum

         Where:

         A        is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to
                  be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from
                  time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash
                  ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash
                  ratio requirements.

         B        is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and
                  the Mandatory Cost and, if the Loan is an unpaid sum, the
                  additional rate of interest specified in clause 18.3) payable
                  for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.

                                      121
<PAGE>

         C        is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that
                  Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest
                  bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.

         D        is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of
                  England to the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

         E        is the rate of charge payable by that Lender to the Financial
                  Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations (but, for
                  this purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to
                  the Fees Regulations) and expressed in pounds per L1,000,000
                  of the Fee Base of that Lender.

5        For the purposes of this Schedule:

         5.1      "ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES" and "SPECIAL DEPOSITS" have the
                  meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to
                  the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the
                  Bank of England.

         5.2      "FEES REGULATIONS" means the Banking Supervision (Fees)
                  Regulations in force from time to time or such other law or
                  regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of
                  the payment of fees for banking supervision; and

         5.3      "FEE BASE" has the meaning given to it, and will be calculated
                  in accordance with, the Fees Regulations.

6        In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in
         the formulae as percentages (ie 5 per cent will be included in the
         formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by
         subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures
         shall be rounded to four decimal places.

7        Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
         purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but
         without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information
         in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:

         7.1      its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of its
                  Facility Office; and

         7.2      any other information that the Agent may reasonably require
                  for such purpose.

         Each Lender shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to
         the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

8        The percentages or rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of A,
         C and E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the
         information supplied to it pursuant to paragraph 7 above and on the
         assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Agent to the contrary,
         each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special
         Deposits and the Fees Regulations are the same

                                      122
<PAGE>

         as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with
         a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.

9        The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
         results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any
         Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by
         any Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above is true and correct in
         all respects.

10       The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result
         of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional
         Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each
         Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above.

11       Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule is in relation
         to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount
         payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
         conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

12       The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with Ideal and the
         Lenders, determine and notify all parties any amendments which are
         required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change
         in law, regulation or any requirements form time to time imposed by the
         Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European
         Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces al or
         any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence
         of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties.
