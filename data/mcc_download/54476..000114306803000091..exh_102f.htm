<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agrees to reimburse XLCA, from any available funds, immediately and unconditionally upon demand for all amounts advanced by XLCA under the Policy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also agrees to reimburse XLCA immediately and unconditionally upon demand for all reasonable expenses incurred by XLCA in connection with the enforcement by XLCA of the Company's obligations under this Agreement, together with interest accruing at the Effective Interest Rate on any unpaid expenses from and including the date which is 30 days from the date a statement for such expenses is received by the Company to the date of payment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Issuance Test Covenant.</B></I> The Company will not issue any additional First Mortgage Bonds without the consent of XLCA if at the time of the calculation after giving effect to such issuance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term rating for such First Mortgage Bonds by S&amp;P or Moody's will be at or below A- (negative outlook) or (negative credit watch) or A3 (negative outlook) or (negative credit watch), respectively and the proposed issuance would cause the proportion of First Mortgage Bonds to Total Indebtedness to exceed 50%.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term rating for such First Mortgage Bonds by S&amp;P or Moody's will be at or above A- (stable outlook) or A3 (stable outlook), respectively and the proposed issuance would cause the proportion of First Mortgage Bonds to Total Indebtedness to exceed 75%; </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Company issue First Mortgage Bonds in excess of 50% of Total Indebtedness (such excess, <B><I>"Excess First Mortgage Bonds"</B></I>) and should the long term rating assigned to First Mortgage Bonds subsequently be reduced by S&amp;P or Moody's to or below A- (negative outlook) or (negative credit watch) or A3 (negative outlook) or (negative credit watch), respectively, the Company shall be under no obligation to replace its Excess First Mortgage Bonds with unsecured debt, but the consent of XLCA shall be required prior to the issuance of any additional First Mortgage Bonds. </P>

The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which XLCA would otherwise have pursuant to law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.</P>
