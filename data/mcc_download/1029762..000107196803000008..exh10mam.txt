            thereunder, as may be necessary to enable the
            Purchaser to comply with its obligations under
            this Agreement and to enable the issue and
            delivery and sale of the Consideration Shares in

             7.2.4    are all capable, and (subject to normal wear
                 and tear) will remain capable, throughout the
                 respective periods of time during which they
                 are each written down to a nil value in the
                 accounts of the Company or MAM USA, as the
                 case may be, (in accordance with the normal
                 recognised accountancy principles
                 consistently applied prior to the date of
                 this Agreement), of doing the work for which
                 they were designed or purchased.

       7.3  All the stock-in-trade of each of the Company and
            MAM USA, and those of its other assets and
            undertakings which are of an insurable nature,
            are, and have at all material times been, insured
            in amounts representing their full replacement or
            reinstatement value against fire and other risks
            normally insured against by persons carrying on
            the same business as that carried on by the
            Company or MAM USA, as the case may be.

       7.4  Each of the Company and MAM USA is now, and has at
            all material times been, adequately covered
            against accident, damage, injury, third party loss
            (including product liability) loss of profits and
            other risks normally insured against by persons
            carrying on the same business as that carried on
            by the Company or MAM USA, as the case may be.

       7.5  All insurances are currently in full force and
            effect, and nothing has been done or omitted to be
            done which could make any policy or insurance void
            or voidable, or which is likely to result in an
            increase in premium.

       7.6  No claim is outstanding, or may be made, under any
            of the insurance policies and no circumstances
            exist which are likely to give rise to a claim.


       8.   Property Matters

       8.1  Each of the Company and MAM USA has good and
            marketable title to all of its properties which
            comprise all the estate or interests of the
            Company or MAM USA, as the case may be,  in any
            land or premises.

       8.2  Each of the Company and MAM USA has in its
            possession or under its control all duly stamped
            deeds and documents which are necessary to prove
            title to each of such properties.

       8.3  Each of the Company and MAM USA has duly and
            punctually performed and observed all covenants,
            conditions, agreements, statutory requirements,
            planning consents, by-laws, orders and regulations
            affecting any of such properties, and no notice of
            any breach of any such matter has been received.

       8.4  The use of each of such properties is the
            permitted use for the purposes of the Town &
            Country Planning Acts or analogous legislation in
            the USA.

       8.6  Such properties have at all times been held by the
            Company or MAM USA, as the case may be, as
            investments and not trading stock.


       9.   Intellectual Property Rights and Trade Secrets

       9.1  All Intellectual Property rights used or acquired
            by the Company or MAM USA, as the case may be,  in
            connection with its business are in full force and
            effect and are vested in and beneficially owned by
            it.

       9.2  No right or licence has been granted to any person
            by the Company or MAM USA to use in any manner or
            to do anything which would or might otherwise
            infringe any of the Intellectual Property rights
            referred to above; and no act has been done or
            omission permitted by the Company or MAM USA, as
            the case may be,  whereby they or any of them have
            ceased or might cease to be valid and enforceable.

       9.4  The business of each of the Company and MAM USA
            (and of any licensee under a licence granted by
            either of them) as now carried on does not and is
            not likely to infringe any Intellectual Property
            right of any other person (or would not do so if
            the same were valid) or give rise to a liability
            to pay compensation pursuant to the Patents Act
            1977 Sections 40 and 41 and all licences to the
            Company or MAM USA, as the case may be,  in
            respect of any such Right are in full force and
            effect.

       9.5  Neither the Company nor MAM USA has (otherwise
            than in the ordinary and normal course of
            business) disclosed or permitted to be disclosed
            or undertaken or arranged to disclose to any
            person other than the Purchaser any of its know-
            how, trade secrets, confidential information,
            price lists or lists of customers or suppliers.

       9.6  Neither the Company nor MAM USA  is a party to any
            secrecy agreement or agreement which may restrict
            the use of disclosure of information.

       9.7  Nothing has been done or omitted by the Company or
            MAM USA which would enable any licensee under a
            licence granted by the Company or MAM USA, as the
            case may be, to be terminated or which in any way
            constitutes a breach of terms of any licence.

   10.  General Matters

            10.1 So far as the Vendors are aware, all information
            given by the Vendors, or the Vendors' accountants
            to the Purchaser, or the Purchaser's accountants
            relating to the business, activities, affairs, or
            assets or liabilities of the Company or MAM USA,
            as the case may be, was, when given, and is now
            accurate and comprehensive in all respects.

            10.2 To the best of the Vendors' knowledge, there are
            no material facts or circumstances, in relation to
            the assets, business or financial condition of the
            Company or MAM USA, as the case may be, which have
            not been fully and fairly disclosed in writing to
            the Purchaser and which, if disclosed, might
            reasonably have been expected to affect the
            decision of the Purchaser to enter into this
            Agreement.
