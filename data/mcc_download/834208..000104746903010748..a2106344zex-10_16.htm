an action taken by or omission at the direction of an authorized employee of NavTech hereunder, and provided further that in no event shall any action taken by or omission by SEI that constitutes
gross negligence or intentional misconduct be deemed to be an action taken or omission at the direction of an authorized employee of NavTech hereunder. It is understood and agreed that the "hold
harmless" and indemnification provisions (including any limitations on liability contained therein) contained in Sections VI.H and VI.I of the Navigation Software License and Support Agreement, made
as of September&nbsp;16, 1991, and Sections V.H and V.I of the Database Software Development and Maintenance Agreement, made as of January&nbsp;1, 1992, each between NavTech and SEI, are and shall

the Plan of Reorganization was entered into or did not result from the breach by SEI or any shareholder, employee, director or agent thereof of any covenant or obligation in the Plan of
Reorganization, as the case may be. Except as provided in the preceding sentence: (i)&nbsp;the right to indemnification hereunder based on representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations
made under the Plan of Reorganization and the SEI Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), at any time whether before or
after the execution and delivery of the Plan of Reorganization or the SEI Agreement or the Effective Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation; and (ii)&nbsp;the waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Person shall been entitled

misconduct or act of bad faith by such Indemnified Person. </FONT></P>

by New SEI "Within twenty-five (25)&nbsp;business days after such Final Determination Date) and third to the Escrow Fund (if not paid within five (5)&nbsp;business days thereafter by
the Principal Shareholder) for satisfaction of amounts owed under such indemnity; provided that each of New SEI and the
Principal Shareholder agree that in no event will either of them be relieved of any indemnification obligations by reason thereof. New SEI hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Principal
Shareholder from and against and/or in respect of any payments that the Principal Shareholder may be required to make pursuant to this Agreement. The failure of New SEI to indemnify the Principal
