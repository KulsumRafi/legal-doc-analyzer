                   ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SECURITY AGREEMENT

I also agree and promise as follows:

         1. ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND INDEBTEDNESS: In addition to the collateral
described on the page 1 hereof, this note is secured by any additions,
replacements, accessions, products or proceeds, including proceeds of any
insurance payable as a result of loss or damage to the collateral, and any
similar after-acquired collateral. However, the security interest shall not
attach to household goods not purchased with the proceeds of this loan or to
other after-acquired consumer goods, with the exception of accessions, unless
such after-acquired consumer goods are acquired within ten (10) days after you
make this loan. Unless the collateral consists of household goods, the security
interested created hereby secures the prompt repayment of all my present and
future obligations to you, including, but not limited to, any obligations
arising as a result of any future advances, overdrafts, or guarantees, or any
expenses or costs incurred by you in accordance with this note, the security
agreement contained herein, or any other agreement I have entered into with you.

         2. WARRANTY OF TITLE: I warrant to you that I own the collateral free
and clear of all liens or security interests, other than the security interest
created hereunder, and that I will defend the collateral against any asserted
claims or demands by other parties.

         3. PRESERVATION OF COLLATERAL: I will preserve and maintain the
collateral and keep the collateral in good condition and repair and will allow
you to inspect the collateral at any time.

         4. TAXES, ETC.: I will pay all taxes and other encumbrances on the
collateral promptly, and I will otherwise maintain the collateral free and clear
of any liens, encumbrances or other security interests.

         5. SALE, ETC. OF COLLATERAL: I will not sell, convey, lease or
otherwise transfer the collateral or any part of it except in the ordinary
course of business, without first obtaining written consent from you. Any waiver
of your right to object to an unauthorized sale or transfer shall not constitute
a waiver with respect to any subsequent unauthorized sale or transfer.

         6. INSURANCE: I agree to maintain insurance on the collateral in
amounts and with companies acceptable to you. You will be designated as loss
payee on all insurance policies, and I will promptly furnish you with insurance
certificates or policies which show your insured interests. I will be in default
if I fail to provide this insurance coverage, and you are hereby authorized, in
such event, to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the balance of my
indebtedness to you and add the expense of such insurance to the total of my
obligation to you which resulting amount shall then earn interest at the rate of
interest then in effect under this note. At your discretion, this increased
amount may be either (a) divided into installments, in which case I agree to
make increased installment payments upon the same payment interval required by
this agreement, and your exercise of this right, with the subsequent increase in
my monthly payment, shall not constitute a new obligation or satisfy or replace
my original obligation, but shall be simply a confirmation of my obligation
hereunder, or (b) charged as a single lump sum balloon payment due upon maturity
of this agreement. You are not obligated to pay any insurance premiums or to
carry any form of insurance coverage on the collateral. I hereby appoint you as
my attorney-in-fact to endorse any insurance proceeds or refund checks in order
to collect the amount due on those checks. Any insurance obtained by you will be
cancelled and a refund or credit of unearned charges made if I provide you with
satisfactory evidence of acceptable insurance.

         7. ACCOUNTS AS COLLATERAL: If I have given you a security interest in
my accounts receivable, I agree not to settle or compromise any account for less
than the full amount for less than the full amount of that account without first
obtaining your written consent.

         I agree to collect my accounts receivable only until you instruct me to
do otherwise. I agree to keep the proceeds of all accounts receivable and any
goods returned to me in trust for your benefit, and I agree not to commingle
them with any other accounts or property of mine. Upon your request, I agree to
remit those proceeds to you.

         8. INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL: If I have given you a security interest in
my inventory, I agree to dispose of it only in the ordinary course of business
for the fair market value of the property, or for some other price that we have
mutually agreed upon.

         9. FARM PRODUCTS AS COLLATERAL: If I have given you a security interest
in my farm products, I agree to provide you with a written list of buyers,
commission merchants or selling agents to or through whom I may sell those farm
products. The terms used in this paragraph shall have the meaning attributed to
them under the Food Security Act of 1985.

         10. RIGHTS UNDER THE SECURITY AGREEMENT: You have the following rights
under this Security Agreement:

         (1)  You may notify account debtors of your security interest in my
              accounts receivable and direct the account debtor to remit to you
              or someone else that you designate, rather than to me; you may
              endorse any checks or other items received from those account
              debtors;

         (2)  You may note the fact of your security interest in the collateral
              on the face of any chattel paper or instruments covered by this or
              any other security agreement I have signed to you;

         (3)  With respect to any collateral covered hereby, you may demand,
              collect, endorse, receive, give receipt for, compromise, settle
              and handle any suits or other proceedings involving the collateral
              in my name;

         (4)  You may take any steps you feel necessary in order to take
              possession of or protect the collateral, including performing any
              part of a contract or endorsing that contract in my name; and

         (5)  You may make any necessary entries to my business records showing
              the existence of the security interest.

         (6)  You may exercise any other rights or remedies available to a
              secured party under the Arkansas Uniform Commercial Code, or
              under other state or federal law.

         11. PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU: If I fail to pay any charges that I am
obligated to pay to preserve or protect the collateral, you are authorized to
make those payments on my behalf and treat those payments made under the terms
of this note and add the total of those advances to the unpaid principal balance
of this note, the total of which will then bear interest at the rate then
applicable to the note and be secured by the collateral.

         12. PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTEREST: With respect to a purchase money
security interest arising under this security agreement:

         (1)  Payments made on non-purchase money loans secured by this
              agreement will not be deemed applicable to any purchase money
              loans, and

         (2)  Payments made on any purchase money loan will be applied first to
              any non-purchase money portion of said loan, with the remaining
              balance to be applied to the purchase money obligations in the
              order in which the items of collateral were acquired. A purchase
              money loan means a loan used in whole or in part to acquire the
              collateral which secures the loan and any extension, renewal,
              consolidation of refinancings of such loans.

         13. REMEDIES UNDER THE SECURITY AGREEMENT: I will be in default under
the terms of this security agreement if I default under the terms of any note
that this agreement secures or if I fail to keep any promise contained in this
agreement. If I default, you shall have all of the rights and remedies available
to a secured creditor under the Arkansas Uniform Commercial Code. I will be
obligated to make the property available to you at a reasonably convenient place
and time. I agree that you are then authorized to take possession of the
collateral and sell it as provided under the terms of the Arkansas Uniform
Commercial Code. I agree that written notice sent to my address on the face of
the note by first class mail ten (10) days in advance of any such sale will be
reasonable notice.

         14. FILING: A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this
agreement may be used as a financing statement.

                          ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTE

I also agree and promise as follows:

         1. PAYMENTS: Each payment that I make under the terms of this note will
be applied first to any unpaid collection costs, late charges or other costs or
expenses that I must pay under the terms of this note or the security agreement,
then to accrued by unpaid interest, and any remaining amount of principal.

         PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTEREST: With respect to a purchase money
security interest arising under this security agreement:

         (1)  Payments made on non-purchase money loans secured by this
              agreement will not be deemed applicable to any purchase money
              loans, and

         (2)  Payments made on any purchase money loan will be applied first to
              any non-purchase money portion of said loan, with the remaining
              balance to be applied to the purchase money obligations in the
              order in which the items of collateral were acquired. A purchase
              money loan means a loan used in whole or in part to acquire the
              collateral which secures the loan and any extension, renewal,
              consolidation of refinancings of such loans.

         2. RENEWALS AND EXTENSIONS. I agree that you may renew or extend the
maturity of this note one or more times, in your sole discretion, without
affecting my liability or that of any other party responsible for the repayment
of this note, and I further agree that you may renew or extend the maturity the
maturity of this note without in any way affecting your right or lien upon any
property given as collateral for this note.

         3. INDEX RATE: If the interest rate on this note is established at a
rate which varies with respect to an index rate will determine the rate on this
note. I understand that the index rate is not necessarily the lowest rate that
you charge on your loans. I also understand that under no circumstances will the
interest rate charged on this note exceed the maximum rate allowed by law.

         4. SINGLE ADVANCE LOANS. If this loan is made as a single advance, that
one advance is the only advance anticipated. However, you may add any amounts to
the principal balance of this note to the extent that those amounts represent
payments made as provided in

51127
<PAGE>


the paragraph above entitled "PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU" or as otherwise provided for
herein or in any other agreement I have made with you.

         5. MULTIPLE ADVANCE LOANS: If this loan is to be made in multiple
advances, you and I anticipate that more than one advance will be made.

         On extensions of closed-end credit, repayments of a portion of the
principal balance of the note will not enable me to obtain additional credit.

         On extensions of open-end credit, repayment of a portion of the
principal balance of the note will entitle me to obtain additional credit,
unless the open-end credit commitment evidenced by this note has expired or has
been terminated by you. You will not be obligated to make an advance to the
extent that such an advance would cause the unpaid principal of the note to
exceed the maximum face amount of the note. You have no obligation to make such
an advance, even if you occasionally choose to do so.

         6. INTERST: Each advance made under the terms of this note will earn
interest only from the date that I receive the advance. The interest rate
provided for in this note at any point in time will apply to the entire
principal balance outstanding at the time.

         7. POST MATURITY RATE: For purposes of this note the term "maturity"
shall mean the following:

         (1)  If the note is a "demand" note, the date you make your demand or
              the date that payment of the note is accelerated by you, whichever
              is earlier;

         (2)  If the note is a "demand" note with a stated alternate maturity
              date, the date of your demand or the alternate maturity date or
              the date that you accelerate payment to the note, whichever date
              is earlier; or

         In all other cases, the date set for the last regularly scheduled
payment of principal or the date that you accelerate payment of the note,
whichever date is earlier.

         8. SET-OFF: You have the right to set-off my deposit accounts and any
other rights that I may have to receive the payment of money from you. You may
exercise your right to set-off without notice to me and without regard to the
type or value of collateral or the existence of any guaranty for or other
agreements to pay this note.

         You will not be responsible for the dishonor of any check when that
dishonor occurs as a result of your exercise of the right of set-off against my
account.

         9. DEFAULT: I will be in default if any of the following events occurs:

         (1)  I fail to make a required payment when due;

         (2)  I breach any promise I have made to you under the terms of this
              note, the security agreement (if applicable) or any other loan or
              agreement with you;

         (3)  Any representation, warranty, promise or statement that I have
              made to you proves to be (or at the time it was made or given was)
              materially false or incorrect;

         (4)  I die, become insolvent, or initiate bankruptcy or similar
              proceedings, or am adjudged a bankrupt.

         (5)  Any of my property in which you have a lien or security interest
              is attached or otherwise taken another creditor, including any
              garnishment of my accounts with you;

         (6)  I fail to maintain insurance covering the collateral;

         (7)  The maturity of any indebtedness I owe to others is accelerated as
              a result of the occurrence of a default under this or any other
              agreement;

         (8)  You at any time believe that the prospect for repayment of any
              portion of the indebtedness secured hereby is significantly
              impaired.

         10. LENDER'S REMEDIES: Upon default, you may at your option, do one or
more of the following:

         (1)  You may, without notice, accelerate the maturity of this note and

              be immediately due and payable;

         (2)  You may exercise your right to set-off against any right I have to
              receive payment of money from you;

         (3)  You may exercise any rights or remedies you have under any other
              agreement which secures this note;
