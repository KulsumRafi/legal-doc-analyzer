     SmartServ Online, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its
successors, the "Company"), for value received hereby promises to pay to:

                       GLOBAL CAPITAL FUNDING GROUP, L.P.

(the "Holder") and registered assigns, the principal sum of One Million
($1,000,000) or, if less, the principal amount of this Note then outstanding, on
the Maturity Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Holder
in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of

to pay interest, which shall begin to accrue on the date of this Note, quarterly
in arrears, on (i) the last day of March, June, September and December of each
year until the Maturity Date, commencing March 31, 2003 (unless such day is not
a Business Day, in which event on the next succeeding Business Day) (each an
"Interest Payment Date"), (ii) the Maturity Date, (iii) each Conversion Date, as
hereafter defined, and (iv) the date the principal amount of the Convertible
Note shall be declared to be or shall automatically become due and payable, on
the principal sum hereof outstanding in like coin or currency, at the rates per
annum set forth below, from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid on this Convertible Note, or if no interest has been paid

     The interest rate shall be ten percent (10%) per annum (the "Interest
Rate") or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Past due
amounts (including interest, to the extent permitted by law) will also accrue
interest at the Interest Rate plus 2% per annum or, if less, the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law, and will be payable on demand ("Default Interest").
Interest on this Convertible Note will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30 day months. All payments of principal and interest hereunder
shall be made for the benefit of the Holder pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement (hereafter defined). At the option of the Holder, interest may be paid
in cash or in shares of Common Stock. On each Conversion Date, interest shall be
paid in cash or shares of Common Stock on the portion of the principal balance
of the Convertible Note then being converted. The number of shares of Common
Stock issued as interest shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
interest due on the applicable Interest Payment Date by the Conversion Price
then in effect.

Convertible Note and are incorporated herein by reference. This Convertible Note
is transferable and assignable to one or more Persons, in accordance with the
limitations set forth in the Agreement.

3. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL.

     3.1  PREPAYMENT OF NOTE. The Company may at its option, prepay up to
          $500,000 principal amount of this Convertible Note at any time
          following the date of issuance of this Convertible Note through the
          90th day following the date of issuance for a prepayment price equal
          to the amount of principal being repaid plus all accrued and unpaid
          interest with respect thereto, regardless of whether the Convertible
          Note is in Default. At any time following (i) such 90-day period with
          respect to the first $500,000 principal amount of Convertible Note and
          (ii) the date of issuance o f this Convertible Note, with respect to
          the second $500,000 principal amount of the Convertible Note, and for
          so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing
          and the Company is not in receipt of a Notice of Conversion from the
          Holder of the Note, the Company may, at its option, prepay, in whole
          or in part, this Convertible Note for a pre-payment price (the
          "Prepayment Price") equal to the outstanding principal amount of the
          Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest. The Company shall not be
          entitled to send any notice of prepayment and begin the prepayment
          procedure unless it has (i) the full amount of the Prepayment Price,
          in cash, available in a demand or other immediately available account
          in a bank or similar financial institution or (ii) immediately
          available credit facilities, in the full amount of the Prepayment
          Price, with a bank or similar financial institution on the date the
          prepayment notice is sent to the Holders of this Convertible Note.
          Provided, however, the Company will process any Notice of Conversion
          received prior to the issuance of a notice of prepayment or within
          seven days following the date of such notice; and further provided
          that, the Holder may issue a Notice of Conversion following such seven
          day period which notice will not be honored unless the Company fails
          to make the prepayment payment when due. In the event of such failure,
          the Notice of Conversion will be honored as of the date of the Notice
          of Conversion

     3.2  PAYMENT ON MATURITY DATE. The Company shall repay the remaining unpaid
          balance of this Convertible Note on the Maturity Date.

4.   CONVERSION.

     4.1  CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTE. Subject to Section 5 hereof, the
          Holder shall have the right, at its option, at any time from and after
          the date of issuance of this Convertible Note, to convert up to
          $500,000 the principal amount of this Convertible Note, or any portion
          of such principal amount, into that number of fully paid and
          nonassessable shares of Common Stock (as such shares shall then be
          constituted) determined pursuant to this Section 4.1. The Holder shall
          have the right to convert the remaining $500,000 principal amount of
          this Convertible Note at any time following the 90th day following the
          date of issuance of this Convertible Note. The number of shares of
          Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Convertible
          Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
          below) by the Conversion Price in effect on the date (the "Conversion
          Date") a Notice of Conversion is delivered to the Company, as
          applicable, by the Holder by facsimile or other reasonable means of
          communication dispatched prior to 5:00 p.m., E.S.T. The term
          "Conversion Amount" means, with respect to any conversion of this
          Convertible Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this
          Convertible Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) accrued
          and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest
          rates provided in this Convertible Note to the Conversion Date plus
          (3) Default Interest, if any, on the interest referred to in the
          immediately preceding clause (2) plus (4) at the Holder's option, any
          amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, Section
          10.1 of the Agreement or Section 10.4 of the Agreement.



<PAGE>


     4.2  CONVERSION PRICE. At the option of the Holder, any portion or all of
          the outstanding principal amount of this Convertible Note shall be
          converted into a number of shares of Common Stock at the conversion
          price (the "Conversion Price") equal to $1.10.

     4.3  AUTHORIZED SHARES.

     (a) Consistent with Section 7.11 of the Agreement, the Company (i) shall
     promptly irrevocably instruct the Company's transfer agent to issue
     certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
     Convertible Note and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Convertible Note
     shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged
     with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the
     necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the
     terms and conditions of this Convertible Note.

     (b) If at any time a Holder of this Convertible Note submits a Notice of
     Conversion (x) the Company does not have sufficient authorized but unissued
     shares of Common Stock available to effect such conversion in full in
     accordance with the provisions of this Article 4 or (y) the Company is
     prohibited by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Small Cap Market or the
     National Market on which the Common Shares are listed and traded at that
     time to effect such conversion in full as provided in subsection (d) below,
     without stockholder approval (each, a "Conversion Default"), the Company
     shall issue to the Holder all of the shares of Common Stock which are then
     available to effect such conversion. The portion of this Convertible Note
     which the Holder included in its Conversion Notice and which exceeds the
     amount which is then convertible into available shares of Common Stock (the
     "Excess Amount") shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
     herein, not be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms
     hereof until (and at the Holder's option at any time after) the date
     additional shares of Common Stock are authorized by the Company, or its
     stockholders, as applicable. The Company shall pay to the Holder payments
     ("Conversion Default Payments") for a Conversion Default in the amount of
     (N/365) x .24 x the Excess Amount on the Conversion Date in respect of the
     Conversion Default (the "Conversion Default Date"), where N = the number of
     days from the Conversion Default Date to the date (the "Authorization
     Date") that the Company, or its stockholders, as applicable, authorizes a
     sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to effect conversion of the
     full outstanding principal balance of this Convertible Note. The Company
     shall use its best efforts to authorize, or cause its stockholders to
     authorize within 60 days of the occurrence of a Conversion Default, a
     sufficient number of shares of Common Stock as soon as practicable
     following the earlier of (i) such time that the Holder notifies the Company
     or that the Company otherwise becomes aware that there are



                                      4
<PAGE>

     or likely will be insufficient shares to allow full conversion thereof and
     (ii) a Conversion Default. The Company shall send notice to the Holder of
     the authorization of additional shares of Common Stock, the Authorization
     Date and the amount of Holder's accrued Conversion Default Payments. The
     accrued Conversion Default Payments for each calendar month shall be paid
     in cash or shall be convertible into Common Stock (at such time as there
     are sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock) at the Market Price, at
     the Holder's option, as follows:

     (1)  In the event the Holder elects to take such payment in cash, cash
          payment shall be made to Holder by the fifth Business Day of the month
          following the month in which it has accrued; and

     (2)  In the event the Holder elects to take such payment in Common Stock,
          the Holder may convert such payment amount into Common Stock at the
          Market Price (as in effect at the time of conversion) at any time
          after the fifth Business Day of the month following the month in which
          it has accrued (at such time as there are sufficient authorized shares
          of Common Stock) in accordance with the terms of this Article 4.

     (c) The Holder's election pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be made in
     writing to the Company at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., E.S.T., on the third
     Business Day of the month following the month in which Conversion Default
     payments have accrued. If no election is made, the Holder shall be deemed
     to have elected to receive cash. Nothing herein shall limit the Holder's
     right to pursue actual damages (to the extent in excess of the Conversion
     Default Payments) due to the Company's failure to maintain a sufficient
     number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

     (d) In no event shall the Company issue more than the Maximum Number of
     Shares upon conversion of this Convertible Note, unless the Company shall
     have obtained approval by the stockholders of the Company ("Stockholder
     Approval") or a waiver of such requirement by the Nasdaq Small Cap Market
     or the National Market on which the Common Shares are listed and traded at
     that time. Once the Maximum Number of Shares has been issued (the date of
     which is hereinafter referred to as the "Maximum Conversion Date"), unless
     the Company shall have obtained Stockholder Approval or a waiver of such
     requirement by the Nasdaq Small Cap Market or the National Market on which
     the Common Shares are listed and traded at that time within 60 days of the
     Maximum Conversion Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder within five
     (5) Business Days of the expiration of such 60 day period, the Redemption
     Price plus accrued and unpaid Default Interest, if any. The Maximum Number
     of Shares shall be subject to adjustment from time to time for stock
     splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and similar
     events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof as
     contemplated by Article XI of the Agreement. In the event that the Company
     obtains Stockholder Approval, approval of the Nasdaq Small Cap Market or
     the National Market on which the Common Shares are listed and traded at
     that time, or otherwise is able to increase the number of shares to be
     issued above the Maximum Number of Shares (such increased number being the
     "New Maximum Number of Shares"), the references to Maximum Number of Shares
     above shall be deemed to be, instead, references to the New Maximum Number
     of Shares.

     4.4  METHOD OF CONVERSION.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon
     conversion of this Convertible Note in accordance with the terms hereof,
     the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Convertible
     Note to the Company unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this
     Convertible Note is so converted. Rather, records showing the principal
     amount converted (or otherwise repaid) and the date of such conversion or
     repayment shall be maintained on a ledger substantially in the form of
     Annex A attached hereto (a copy of which shall be delivered to the Company
     or transfer agent with each Notice of Conversion). It is specifically
     contemplated that the Holder hereof shall act as the calculation agent for
     conversions and repayments. In the event of any dispute or discrepancies,
     such records maintained by the Holder shall be controlling and
     determinative in the absence of manifest error or failure of Holder to
     record the principal amount converted (or otherwise repaid) from time to
     time, in which events the record of the Company shall be controlling and
     determinative. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this
     Convertible Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions
     of this paragraph, following a conversion of a portion of this Convertible
     Note, the principal amount represented by this Convertible Note will be the
     amount indicated on Annex A attached hereto (which may be less than the
     amount stated on the face hereof).

     (b) The Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
     in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares
     of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this
     Convertible Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street
     name), and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such
     shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or
     persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such
     shares are to be held for the Holder's account) requesting the issuance
     thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or shall
     have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been
     paid.

     (c) Subject to Section 5 hereof, upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of
     Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
     Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal
     amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Convertible
     Note shall be deemed reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the
     Company defaults on its obligations under this Article 4, all rights with
     respect to the portion of this Convertible Note being so converted shall
     forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
     securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion.
     Subject to Section 5 hereof,



                                       6
<PAGE>

if the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the
Company's obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for shares of Common
Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any
action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to
any provisions thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any
action by the Holder to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the
enforcement of any other obligation of the Company to the Holder of record, or
any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach
or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Company, and subject to
Section 4.4(a) irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise
limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with such
conversion. The date of receipt (including receipt via telecopy) of such Notice
of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as it is received before 5:00
p.m., E.S.T., on such date.

     (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received
     certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the expiration of the
     Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Convertible
     Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its
     status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Company), the Holder
     shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Convertible Note with respect
     to such unconverted portions of this Convertible Note and the Company
     shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Convertible Note to
     the holder or, if the Convertible Note has not been surrendered, adjust its
     records to reflect that such portion of this Convertible Note not been
     converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and
     remedies including, without limitation, the right to receive Conversion
     Default Payments to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default
     and any subsequent Conversion Default.

     (e) In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Company's transfer agent is
participating in the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities
Transfer program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the
provisions contained in Section 4.1 and in this Section 4.4, the Company shall
use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of
Holder's Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission
System.

5. REDEMPTION BY COMPANY.

     5.1  MANDATORY REDEMPTION. Subject to the first sentence of Section 3.1 of
          this Convertible Debenture and in accordance with the provisions of

          circumstances, to redeem in whole or in part, the remaining unpaid
          principal amount of this Convertible Note, for cash at a redemption

          applicable Prepayment Price and (B) (x) the number of shares of Common

          the average Closing Bid Price of Common Stock for the five (5) Trading
          Days as reported by Bloomberg L.P. immediately preceding the date that
          this Convertible Note is called for redemption, plus accrued and

     5.3  PAYMENT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. The Redemption Price shall be paid to the

the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of

irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding
brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Company hereby irrevocably
waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of
