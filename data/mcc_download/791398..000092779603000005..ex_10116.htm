of each year. Our subsidiaries have revolving lines of credit established with lenders to
provide seasonal financing for their working capital requirements and may require from

circumstances.</B> </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In connection with our borrowing
under the short-term notes referred to above, we issued warrants to the noteholders,
giving them the right to purchase up to 2,600,000 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $2.95 per share which exercise price shall be reset based upon
the weighted average cash price paid for each share of Common Stock sold in the Offering
(without reduction for fees or expenses in connection with the Offering), and is
thereafter subject to adjustment in certain events. Although we have negotiated amendments
to our agreements with our short-term note holders to eliminate certain &#147;put&#148;
and &#147;call&#148; provisions granted to the warantholders under the agreements, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to finalize these amendments with our warrant
holders. In the event that we do not finalize these amendments, at any time after the
notes are paid in full, the warrant holders will have a &#147;put&#148; by which they can
require us to repurchase the warrants for $0.90 per share, though the Company cannot be
required to make any such repurchase prior to the earlier of (x) the date on which the
Notes are paid in full, and (y) January 1, 2003. There is no assurance that we will have
sufficient capital to meet these repurchase obligations. If we do not pay the repurchase
price when due, interest on the unpaid amount will accrue at the rate of 15%<I> </I>per
annum. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If we do not pay all amounts owing
under the notes by December 31, 2002, the notes will be subject to an increased interest
rate and we will be obligated to deliver to the noteholders on that date, and on each
30<SUP>th</SUP> day thereafter, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,667 shares of our
common stock per day at an per share exercise price equal to our par value per share
(currently $0.01). These additional warrants will also be subject to the &#147;put&#148;
described above, except that the repurchase price under the additional warrants will be
<I>$0.50 </I>per share. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The exercise price of the warrants
and the number of shares subject to the warrants are subject to adjustment as a result of,
among other things, changes in our capital. In addition, the exercise price in each of the
warrants is subject to downward adjustment and the number of shares for which the warrant
is exercisable is subject to upward adjustment if we issue common stock or common stock
equivalents at a price below their fair market value or the exercise price of the
warrants. Any such adjustment and subsequent exercise of the warrants could result in
dilution of your holdings of our common stock. The noteholders have agreed that, if we pay
the notes in full by December 31, 2002, this adjustment provision will be
eliminated retroactively so that it will have no effect. </FONT></P>

require us to register the common stock underlying their warrants, and to bear the

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 10, 2002, we entered into
an agreement with our short-term bridge lenders to amend the terms of the notes and
warrants we issued to them on December 14, 2001 and the registration rights agreement we
entered into with them on the same date. Under the terms of the agreement, the short-term
bridge lenders will exchange the notes for $4 million in cash and 1,000 shares of Eos
Series D Preferred Stock. The transactions contemplated by the agreement are contingent
upon us effecting (i) the merger with IFS, and (ii) this offering. If the transactions
contemplated by the agreement are not effected by January 8, 2003, any party to the
agreement may terminate it without any liability to any other party. However, such
termination would not relieve us from any liability under the notes, warrants, or
registration rights agreement. </FONT></P>

when the registration statement to be filed with the SEC will become effective. The
disclosures to be contained in the registration statement concerning our business may
become subject to review by the SEC. The period necessary to achieve effectiveness with
the SEC will be affected by our ability to provide disclosures concerning our business or

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities
that are subject to a power to vote or dispose are deemed beneficially owned by the person
who holds such power, directly or indirectly. This means that the same securities may be
deemed beneficially owned by more than one person, if such power is shared. In addition,
the beneficial ownership rules provide that shares which may be acquired upon exercise of
an option or warrant, or which may be acquired upon the termination of a trust,
discretionary account or similar arrangement, which can be effected within a period of 60
days from the date of determination, are deemed to be &#147;beneficially&#148; owned.
Furthermore, shares that are subject to rights or powers even though such rights or powers
to acquire are not exercisable within the 60-day period may also be deemed to be
beneficially owned if the rights or powers were acquired &#147;with the purpose or effect
of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer or in connection with or as a
participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
determining whether securities are &#147;beneficially owned,&#148; benefits which are
substantially equivalent to those of ownership by virtue of any contract, understanding,
relationship, agreement or other arrangement should cause the securities to be listed as
&#147;beneficially owned.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus,
for example, securities held for a person&#146;s benefit in the name of others or in the
name of any estate or trust in which such person may be interested should also be listed.
Securities held by a person&#146;s spouse, children or other members of such person&#146;s
family who are such person&#146;s dependents or who live in such person&#146;s household
should be listed as &#147;beneficially owned&#148; unless such person does not enjoy
benefits equivalent to those of ownership with respect to such securities. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a person has a proprietary or beneficial interest in a controlled corporation,
partnership, personal holding company, trust or estate which owns of record or
beneficially any securities, such person should state the amount of such securities owned
by such controlled corporation, partnership, personal holding company, trust or estate in
lieu of allocating such person&#146;s proprietary interest, and by note or otherwise,
please indicate that. In any case, the name of the controlled corporation, partnership,
personal holding company, or estate must be stated. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
