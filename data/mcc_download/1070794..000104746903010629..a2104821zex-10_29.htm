<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>W I T N E S S E T H:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company employed Executive pursuant to an employment agreement entered into as of October&nbsp;23, 2000 (the "Employment Agreement"), but the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and Executive wish to enter into a new agreement that will supercede the Employment Agreement, except to the extent specifically set forth below (and all capitalized
terms herein that are not defined shall have the same definition as in the Employment Agreement), to provide for a mutual release as to all claims including, without limitation, claims that might be
asserted by Executive under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as further described herein, and to provide certain benefits in exchange for Executive's release and cooperation; </FONT></P>

records and business documents

Company or of any of its subsidiaries and affiliates; provided, however that Executive may keep his computer and related incidental equipment after removing all Company-related material. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
Executive's resignation from employment, in consideration of the release provided by Executive under paragraph&nbsp;5 below, his cooperation with the
Company and other good and valuable consideration, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid or provided to Executive, subject to applicable employment and income tax withholdings and deductions,

Section&nbsp;5(a) of the Employment Agreement and subparagraph (d)&nbsp;below; provided, however, that any and all compensation previously deferred by Executive, whether under the Employment
Agreement or pursuant to the terms of the Deferral Plan shall be paid at the time and in the form elected by Executive under the terms of the Deferral Plan. In addition, compensation deferred under
the provisions of Section&nbsp;3 of the Employment Agreement shall continue to be credited with interest, as specified in accordance with Section&nbsp;3(a)(2) of the Employment Agreement, until

administrators hereafter may have, by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of Executive's employment with the Company to the date of this Agreement arising from or
relating in any way to Executive's employment relationship and the termination of his employment relationship with the Company, including but not limited to, any claims which have been asserted, could
have been asserted, or could be asserted now or in the future under any federal, state or local laws, including any claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C.

Executive has accrued and is due a benefit or to Executive's right to indemnification by the Company, or through any insurance purchased by the Company, to the maximum extent that Executive would have
been entitled to indemnification during his employment by the Company. Executive expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which expressly limits the effect of a release with respect to
unknown claims. Executive acknowledges the significance of this release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims which provides that a general
release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor. In consideration of Executive's release, the Company shall execute a release in favor of Executive, on the date this Agreement becomes irrevocable, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Annex 1. </FONT></P>

his attorney, and that he understands its terms and effects. Executive acknowledges, further, that he is executing this Agreement, including the release, of his own volition with a full understanding
of its terms and effects and with the intention of releasing all claims recited herein in exchange for the consideration described above, which he acknowledges is adequate and satisfactory to him.
None of the above-named parties, nor their agents, representatives, or attorneys have made any representations to Executive concerning the terms or effects of this Agreement other than those contained
herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
hereby acknowledges that he has the right to consider this Agreement, and the release set forth in paragraph&nbsp;5, for a period of 21&nbsp;days prior to
execution. Executive also understands that he has the right to revoke this General Release for a period of seven days following execution by giving written notice to the Company at 3930 Howard Hughes
Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89109, Attention: General Counsel, in which event the provisions of this Agreement shall be null and void, and the parties shall have the rights, duties, obligations and
remedies afforded by applicable law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
agrees to reasonably consult with the Company with respect to matters in which the knowledge gained during his employment is needed by the
Company, provided that the Company reimburses Executive for all reasonable expenses incurred and the Company's request does not unreasonably interfere with Executive's business or personal activities
following the End Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company will not disparage Executive or Executive's performance or otherwise take any action that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Executive's
personal or professional reputation. Similarly, Executive will not disparage the Company or otherwise take any action that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the reputation of the
Company; provided, however, that the Company agrees not to withhold or otherwise subject any payment, benefit or right under this Agreement to any limitation by reason of any violation or purported
violation of this subparagraph by Executive. Executive and the Company each agree that his or its sole remedy under this subparagraph shall be damages actually proven in an arbitration under
paragraph&nbsp;9. </FONT></P>
