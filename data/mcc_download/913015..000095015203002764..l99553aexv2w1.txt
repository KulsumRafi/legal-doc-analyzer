                WHEREAS, on January 17, 2002, involuntary petitions for relief
under chapter 7 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections

                WHEREAS, on February 20, 2002, each Seller (other than Brill),
as well as other direct and indirect subsidiaries of Brill, pursuant to the

of administration by the Bankruptcy Court, the "Chapter 11 Case"); and

                WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to purchase and obtain the

        Section 1.3 Assumed Liabilities. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall
assume and/or accept assignment from the Sellers and thereafter pay, perform, or
discharge in accordance with their terms the following obligations of Sellers
(the "Assumed Liabilities"):

                (a) the obligations of the Sellers under the Assumed Contracts
that, by the terms of such Assumed Contracts, arise after Closing, relate to or
are incurred in periods following the Closing and are to be observed, paid,
discharged, or performed, as the case may be, in each case at any time after the
Closing Date (except to the extent such obligations arise out of or are related
to activities, events or transactions occurring, or conditions existing, on or
prior to the Closing Date), including (a) all agreements for the sale of
advertising time on the Radio Broadcast Stations for cash and at prices
consistent with Sellers' ordinary course of business pricing policies for which
no payment has been received and which do not have more than twelve (12) months
remaining in their term ("Time Sales Agreements"); and (b) (subject to Section
1.7(f)) all agreements which are for consideration other than cash, such as
merchandise, services or promotional consideration arising in the ordinary
course of business consistent with the past practices of Sellers ("Trade
Agreements"); and

                (b) all liabilities prorated against the Sellers pursuant to
Section 1.7.

At Closing and pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, Sellers shall
assume and sell, transfer and assign to Purchaser the Assumed Contracts
(including the Real Property Leases), and shall have obtained prior Bankruptcy
Court approval for same in the Sale Order. The cure amounts, as determined by
the Bankruptcy Court, if any (the "Cure Amounts"), necessary to cure all
defaults, if any, and to pay all actual or pecuniary losses that have resulted
from such defaults under the Assumed Contracts (including the Real Property
Leases), shall be paid prior to Closing by Sellers and not by the Purchaser and,
subject to Section 1.7(b), the Purchaser shall have no liability therefor.

        Section 1.4 Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser expressly does not, and shall not,
assume or agree to pay, satisfy, discharge or perform and will not be deemed by
virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any agreement,
instrument or document delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise by reason of or in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to have assumed or to have
agreed to pay, satisfy, discharge or perform, any liabilities, obligations or
commitments of Sellers of any nature whatsoever whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not disclosed to Purchaser, other than
the Assumed Liabilities. Sellers will retain all liabilities and obligations of
the Sellers, other than the Assumed Liabilities, including but not limited to,
the obligation to assume, perform, satisfy or pay any liability, obligation,
agreement, debt, charge, claim, judgment or expense incurred by or asserted
against Seller related to taxes, environmental matters, pension or retirement
plans or trusts, profit-sharing plans, employment contracts,

<PAGE>

employee benefits, severance of employees, product liability or warranty,
negligence, contract breach or default, or other obligations, claims or
judgments asserted against Purchaser as successor in interest to Sellers,
regardless of whether any such matters are disclosed on the Seller Disclosure
Letter hereto (the "Excluded Liabilities"). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not assume, and the Sellers, shall remain
responsible for the following:

                (a) any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
contingent, or otherwise) which accrue with respect to the Assets or Sellers'
operation of the Business on or prior to the Closing Date;

                (b) any liability or obligation of the Sellers for any Taxes of
any kind (except for any Taxes subject to proration under Section 1.7 for which
Purchaser received a credit against the Purchase Price);

                (c) any liabilities or obligations which accrue with respect to
the Excluded Assets, whether before, on or after the Closing Date;

                (d) any liability or obligation in respect of any Employee
Benefit Plan or any other Seller Plan;

                (e) any liabilities or obligations of the Sellers arising under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar state law
("WARN"); and

                (f) any liabilities and obligations of the Sellers arising under
Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") or similar state law.

        Section 1.5 Non-Assignment of Assumed Contracts. Anything contained
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, but subject to Section 7.3(c) and (e),
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assumed Contract,
if, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of the third party
thereto, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way negatively affect the
rights of the Sellers or the Purchaser, as the assignee of such Assumed
Contract, as the case may be, thereunder. If, notwithstanding the provisions of
Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, such consent or approval is
required but not obtained, the Sellers will cooperate with the Purchaser without
further consideration in any reasonable arrangement designed to both (a) provide
the Purchaser benefits under any such Assumed Contract and (b) cause the
Purchaser to bear all costs and obligations of or under any such Assumed
Contract arising or incurred from and after the Closing. Any assignment to the
Purchaser of any Assumed Contract that shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, require the consent or approval of
any third party for such assignment as aforesaid shall be made subject to such
consent or approval being obtained.

        Section 1.6 Purchase Price. (a) The aggregate purchase price for the
Assets shall be $62,029,000. The Purchase Price shall be payable (subject to
subparagraph (d) of this Section 1.6)at the Closing as follows: (i) $31,014,500
in cash (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 1.9(b)(iv)) payable in
immediately available United States funds (the "Cash Consideration"), and (ii)
$31,014,500, payable by delivery in the manner provided in Section 2.1, of that
number of

<PAGE>

shares of Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, equal to the
result obtained by dividing (x) $31,014,500 by (y) the Per Share Price (the
"Stock Consideration"). The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration may
collectively be referred to at the "Purchase Price."

        The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Sellers in accordance
with the allocation set forth in a certificate approved by the Bankruptcy Court
and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and delivered by Sellers to Purchaser not
less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Following the Closing,
Sellers agree that any Stock Consideration received by the Sellers will only be
distributed (i) pursuant to a valid exemption from registration (or pursuant to
a registration statement), and (ii) only upon Purchasers' receipt of such
documents, materials and information (or copies thereof) as the Purchaser may
reasonably request to ensure Purchaser's compliance with any applicable state
and Federal securities laws. Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to
limit distribution of the Stock Consideration to creditors who would receive not
less than a number of shares of Common Stock as agreed to by Purchaser and
Sellers.

        The following legend shall be placed on each certificate representing
shares of Common Stock issued to Sellers or any creditor who receive shares of
Common Stock pursuant to an exemption from registration in a private offering
(or such other legend as Purchaser reasonably determines is appropriate):

                "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
                REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR
                UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION,
                AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
                EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER, OR IN COMPLIANCE WITH AN
                EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF, THAT ACT AND
                ANY SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS."

                (b) The Purchase Price allocated to Sellers pursuant to Section
1.6(a) above shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. On
or prior to the date ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide Sellers with Purchaser's proposed allocation of the total consideration
paid for the Assets. Such Allocation shall be binding on each Seller, its
Affiliates and the Purchaser for all Tax reporting purposes unless the relevant
Seller can establish that such allocation is unreasonable. Sellers and Purchaser
agree to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and any other forms or
statements required by the Code (or state or local Tax law) consistent with such
allocation.

                (c) The Purchaser and Sellers shall comply with the procedures
set forth in the Consent Order Approving Bidding Procedures dated June 25, 2002,
relating to the Brill bankruptcy, including but not limited to making any
deposits in a timely manner.

                (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Per
Share Price is less than $7.50 per share, Purchaser reserves the right, in its
sole discretion, to reallocate the Purchase Price at the Closing among the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration to increase the allocation of the cash
portion of the Purchase Price in Section 1.6(a)(i).

<PAGE>

        Section 1.7 Prorations and Adjustments. (a) The following prorations
relating to the Assets and the ownership and operation of the Business and
adjustments to the Purchase Price will be made as of the Closing Date, to the
extent practicable, with the Sellers liable to the extent such items relate to
any time period prior to the Closing Date and the Purchaser liable to the extent
such items relate to periods beginning with and subsequent to the Closing Date:

                        (i) Ad valorem, real estate and other property taxes on
or with respect to the Assets.

                        (ii) Rents, additional rents, taxes and other items
payable by the Sellers under the Real Property Leases.

                        (iii) The amount of rents, taxes and charges for sewer,
water, telephone, electricity and other utilities relating to the Real Property
and the real property subject to the Real Property Leases.

                        (iv) Business and license fees, music and other license
fees (including any retroactive adjustments thereof).

                        (v) All other items normally adjusted in connection with
similar transactions.

                        (vi) Within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the
commencement of the Time Brokerage Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
a report, dated as of the date of commencement of the Time Brokerage Agreement
(the "Commencement Date Trade Report") which report lists all Trade Agreements
included in the Assets and the contract end date for each Trade Agreement
together with an itemized statement, determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, of the aggregate value of time owed ("Barter
Payable") pursuant to each of the Trade Agreements and the aggregate value of
goods and services to be received ("Barter Receivable") pursuant to each of the
Trade Agreements. To the extent that the aggregate value as reflected on the
Commencement Date Trade Report of the Station's Barter Payable is greater than
the aggregate value as reflected on the Commencement Date Trade Report of the
Barter Receivable, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive the difference at
Closing as a credit against the Cash Consideration.

                (b) The Cash Consideration payable pursuant hereto shall be
increased by: (i) the lesser of (A) $337,000, and (B) the amount necessary to
cover damages for any Contracts rejected by the Sellers, and (ii) the lesser of
(A) $134,000, and (B) the amount necessary to cover Sellers' obligation to pay
all Cure Amounts hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers acknowledge
that they alone are responsible for the determination and payment of damages for
any Contracts rejected and any Cure Amounts. Sellers agree to keep Purchaser
advised of any claims for rejection damages and any disputes with third parties
regarding such claims or any Cure Payments and provide Purchaser with the
opportunity to participate in discussions regarding the determination of such
rejection claims and/or the resolution of any such disputes. Sellers will
provide prompt notice to Purchaser of the receipt of any claims for rejection
damages along with copies of relevant documentation and disclosure of any
defenses or offsets that may be available to Sellers.

<PAGE>

                (c) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the net amount of
all such prorations and adjustments shall be settled and paid on the Closing
Date by appropriate adjustment of the Cash Consideration. As to those prorations
and adjustments not readily ascertained on the Closing Date, Purchaser and
Sellers will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve and pay
all adjustments and prorations hereunder within ninety (90) calendar days of the
Closing Date. Real and personal property Taxes with respect to any Assets shall
be pro-rated based on the ratio of number of days in the pre-Closing period to
the number of days in the actual taxable period with respect to which Tax is
assessed, irrespective of when such Taxes are due, become a lien or are
assessed. Sales and use Taxes shall be deemed to accrue as property is
purchased, sold, used, or transferred. All other Taxes shall accrue in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

        Section 1.8 Accounts Receivable.


        Purchaser acknowledges that all accounts receivable arising prior to the
Effective Date of the Time Brokerage Agreement in connection with the operation
of the Stations shall remain the property of Sellers (the "Seller Accounts
Receivable") and that Purchaser shall not acquire any beneficial right or
interest therein or responsibility therefor. For a period of 120 days from the
Effective Date of the Time Brokerage Agreement (the "Collection Period").
Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to collect the Seller Accounts
Receivable and pay such collections on a monthly basis (less any commissions
and/or other expenses due thereon which Purchaser is hereby directed to pay on
Sellers behalf), provided, that, Purchaser's obligation and authority shall not
extend to the institution of litigation, employment of counsel or a collection
agency or any other extraordinary means of collection. During the Collection
Period, Sellers and their agents shall not make any direct solicitation of any
account debtor for collection purposes or institute litigation for the
collection of amounts due. After the Collection Period, any remaining Seller
Accounts Receivable shall be returned to Sellers for collection.

        Section 1.9 Deferred Agreements.

                (a) (i) At any time prior to confirmation of the Bankruptcy
Plan, the Purchaser may designate any or all of the studio leases set forth in
Section 1.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Deferred Leases") as an
additional real estate lease to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Upon any such
designation, Sellers shall promptly file a motion for an order (with such motion
and order in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser)
authorizing and approving the assumption and assignment of such Deferred
Lease(s) to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and
Sellers shall be solely and exclusively liable for all Cure Amounts which arise
in connection with the Deferred Lease(s). Upon entry of a final order, which
shall be final and non-appealable, approving such assumption and assignment (the
"Deferred Real Property Lease Order"), the Deferred Lease(s) shall thereafter be
deemed as a Real Property Lease for all purposes of this Agreement. Sellers
shall be solely and exclusively liable for all payments and liabilities which
arise in connection with the Deferred Lease(s) whether before, on, or after the
Closing Date, until such time as the Deferred Real Property Lease Order is
entered. Prior to the entry of the Deferred Real Property Lease Order, Sellers
shall comply with all of its obligations under the Deferred Lease(s).
<PAGE>

                        (ii) Prior to the assignment and assumption of the
Deferred Leases as described in Section 1.9(a)(i) above, Sellers and the
Purchaser shall take all actions and use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to enter into a sublease (the "Subleases") of the entire
demised premises with respect to the Deferred Leases (the "Subleased Premises"),
cancelable by Purchaser on thirty (30) days prior written notice, granting the
Purchaser the use of the Subleased Premises under the same material terms,
conditions, rights and obligations as the Sellers enjoy as of the Closing Date,
as such terms and conditions may be modified if deemed to be reasonably
acceptable to Sellers and the Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the option to
terminate the Subleases at any time without premium or penalty, by giving thirty
(30) days prior written notice of such election to Sellers.

                        (iii) With respect to the assignment and assumption of
the Deferred Lease described in Section 1.9(a)(i) above and/or the Sublease
described in Section 1.9(a)(ii), as the case may be, the Sellers also agree (x)
to take all actions and use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
Purchaser to enjoy the rights and benefits of the Deferred Lease and/or
Sublease, as the case may be, under the same terms and conditions as the Sellers
enjoys in effect as of the Closing Date, (y) not to disturb Purchaser's right to
quiet enjoyment of the Deferred Lease and/or the Sublease, as the case may be
and (z) defend against any injunction or other judgment that would disturb or in
any way impair Purchaser's right to quiet enjoyment of the Deferred Lease and/or
Sublease, as the case may be.

                        (iv) Sellers agree that they will diligently prosecute
the pending motion to extend the time to accept or reject their non-residential
real property leases so that the date for assumption or rejection of the
non-residential real property leases is extended beyond the current expiration
date of October 18, 2002. Sellers agree to use their best efforts to file and
diligently prosecute such additional motions as may be necessary or required to
continually extend the date for assumption or rejection of the non-residential
real property leases until the confirmation of the Bankruptcy Plan.

                (b) (i) Listed in Section 1.9(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
are certain capital equipment and personal property leases that the Purchaser
may desire to treat as Assumed Contracts (the "Deferred Contracts"). The
Purchaser will have the option, exercisable until the Closing Date, to designate
in writing any or all Deferred Contracts as an Assumed Contract. Upon such
designation, Sellers shall promptly file a motion for one or more orders (with
each such motion and order in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser) authorizing and approving the assumption and assignment of such
Deferred Contracts to Purchaser pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
and Sellers shall be solely and exclusively liable for all Cure Amounts which
arise in connection with the Deferred Contracts. Upon the entry of a final
order, which shall be final and non-appealable, approving such assumption and
assignment (the "Deferred Contracts Order"), such Deferred Contracts shall
thereafter be Assumed Contracts for all purposes of this Agreement. Sellers
shall be solely and exclusively liable for all payments and liabilities which
arise in connection with the Deferred Contracts until such time as the Deferred
Contracts Order is entered.

                        (ii) Prior to the assignment and assumption of the
Deferred Contracts as described in Section 1.9(b)(i) above, Sellers and the
Purchaser shall take all actions and use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to enter into a sublease (the "Equipment

<PAGE>

Subleases") of the equipment and personal property with respect to the Deferred
Contracts (the "Subleased Equipment"), cancelable by Purchaser on thirty (30)
days prior written notice, granting the Purchaser the use of the Subleased
Equipment under the same material terms, conditions, rights and obligations as
the Sellers enjoy as of the Closing Date, as such terms and conditions may be
modified if deemed to be reasonably acceptable to Sellers and the Purchaser.
Purchaser shall have the option to terminate the Equipment Subleases at any time
without premium or penalty, by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice of
such election to Sellers.

                        (iii) With respect to the assignment and assumption of
the Deferred Contracts described in Section 1.9(b)(i) above and/or the Equipment
Subleases described in Section 1.9(b)(ii), as the case may be, the Sellers also
agree to take all actions and use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause
the Purchaser to enjoy the rights and benefits of the Deferred Contracts and/or
Equipment Subleases, as the case may be, under the same terms and conditions as
the Sellers enjoys in effect as of the Closing Date, and defend against any
injunction or other judgment that would disturb or in any way impair Purchaser's
right to use the equipment under the Deferred Contracts and/or Equipment
Subleases, as the case may be.

                        (iv) This Section 1.9(b) shall be inapplicable to the
extent that the Deferred Contracts are determined not to be leases but rather
are financing agreements where the equipment and personal property are sold free
and clear of such financing agreements. Sellers agree that they will, at
Purchaser's request, seek a determination from the Bankruptcy Court on whether
the Deferred Contracts are leases or financing agreements prior to the Closing
Date. If Purchaser requests a determination as to whether any Deferred Contract
is a financing agreement and there is a determination that such Deferred
Contract is a financing agreement, and if there is a further determination that
there is an unsecured claim after the equipment and the personal property
subject of such Deferred Contract are valued by the Bankruptcy Court, Purchaser
will accept liability for the payment for the amount that would otherwise be
payable by the estate on the unsecured claim as reasonably estimated by the
Bankruptcy Administrative Officer and the Cash Consideration will be increased
by the amount of such payment.

                (c) From and after the Effective Date of the Time Brokerage
Agreement, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with access to and the use of (i) the
equipment and personal property under the Deferred Contracts, and (ii) the
facilities under the Deferred Leases.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE CLOSING

available funds to an account or accounts specified in writing by the Sellers,

accrued thereon);

                        (ii) deliver to Sellers a certificate or certificates
representing the Stock Consideration in the name or names designated by the
Sellers pursuant to Section 1.6(a); and

                        (iii) assume the Assumed Liabilities by delivery of (A)
an assumption agreement, and (B) such other good and sufficient instruments of
assumption, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Sellers' and the
Purchaser's respective counsels, as shall be effective to cause the Purchaser to
assume the Assumed Liabilities as and to the extent provided in Section 1.3 (all
such instruments referred to in this subclause (iii) being collectively referred
to herein as the "Assumption Instruments").

                (b) the Sellers shall assign and transfer to Purchaser all of
their right, title and interest in and to the Assets (in each case, free and
clear of any and all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances on Real

substance reasonably acceptable to the Sellers' and the Purchaser's respective
counsels (the "General Assignment"), duly executed by the Sellers, (ii) general
warranty deeds in proper statutory form for recording and otherwise in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser conveying title to the Real
Property and (iii) such other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance,
assignment and transfer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser's counsel, as shall be effective to vest in Purchaser good title to
the Assets (the General Assignment and the other instruments referred to in
clauses (ii) and (iii) being collectively referred to herein as the "Assignment
Instruments").

        Section 2.2 Time Brokerage Agreement. The Sellers and the Purchaser
shall enter into a time brokerage agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit
B hereto (the "Time Brokerage Agreement") promptly after the Sale Order becomes
a Final Order. Upon execution of the Time Brokerage Agreement, Purchaser will
designate a commencement date (the "Effective Date") that will be within thirty
(30) days following such Final Order to allow for an orderly transition. At the
Closing the Time Brokerage Agreement shall terminate in accordance with its
terms.

        Section 2.3 Acquisition Subsidiaries. On or before the Closing, the
Purchaser may designate (by written notice to the Sellers) one or more of its
subsidiaries (each an "Acquisition Subsidiary") to receive all or part of the
Assets; provided, however, that such designation shall not obviate the
Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

        Section 2.4 Deposit. (a) Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall deposit with Greenebaum Doll & McDonald PLLC (the
"Escrow Agent") in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to a segregated
trust or escrow account designated by the Escrow Agent, an amount in cash equal
to $1,000,000 (the "First Deposit"). In addition, prior to the Auction, an
additional deposit of $4,300,000 will be deposited by the Purchaser with the
Escrow Agent (the "Second Deposit" and together with the First Deposit, the
"Deposit"). The Escrow Agent shall invest the Deposit in U.S. government
securities (or a fund comprised of such securities) selected by Escrow Agent and
approved by the Purchaser.

<PAGE>

                (b) Upon the Effective Date of the Time Brokerage Agreement,
Purchaser shall provide and maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit in
the amount of $15,000,000 issued by Fleet Bank, or such other bank as reasonably
acceptable to the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, which irrevocable standby
letter of credit will be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Bankruptcy Administrative Officer (the "Letter of Credit"). The Letter of Credit
shall be for an initial term of six (6) months and will be renewable for
successive six (6) month periods up to a total of two (2) years from the date of
this Agreement, and will contain appropriate notice provisions to allow the
Escrow Agent to draw in the event the Letter of Credit is not so renewed, in
which case the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to so draw. The
Letter of Credit shall be considered for all purposes as the Deposit under this
Section 2.4. The Escrow Agent shall contemporaneously exchange the $5,300,000
cash deposit then on deposit for the Letter of Credit. In the event that the
Time Brokerage Agreement is terminated by Purchaser, the Letter of Credit shall
be returned to the Purchaser and Purchaser shall deposit the sum of $5,300,000
as provided for in Section 2.4(a) and thereafter that sum shall be considered
the Deposit. In the event that the Time Brokerage Agreement shall thereafter
recommence, the above procedure with respect to the Letter of Credit shall be
repeated in all respects.

                (c) In the event that the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated, on the Closing Date the Escrow Agent shall return the Letter of
Credit to Purchaser.

                (d) In the event that the Contemplated Transactions are not
consummated and this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.3(a)
or (b) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized and directed to fully draw
on the Letter of Credit (in accordance with the terms and procedures specified
therein) and pay the proceeds thereof to Sellers (or if the Escrow Agent is then
holding cash, the Escrow Agent will release the Deposit (and any interest
accrued thereon) to the Sellers). In the event that the Contemplated
Transactions are not consummated and this Agreement is terminated for any reason
other than as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Escrow Agent
shall be authorized and directed to return the Letter of Credit (or release the
Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon)) to the Purchaser immediately
following the expiration of the five (5) day objection period described below.
The Escrow Agent shall not release monies from the Deposit (including any cash
received as a result of a draw on the Letter of Credit) as set forth above to
the Sellers unless and until it has received either Bankruptcy Court approval or
a written instruction from the Purchaser authorizing such release. The Escrow
Agent shall not return the Letter of Credit or release monies from the Deposit
as set forth above to the Purchaser if the Sellers object in writing to such
release within five (5) business days of the occurrence of the event providing
for such release, unless and until any dispute has been resolved by the
Bankruptcy Court or it receives a written instruction from the Sellers
authorizing such release. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
the event of a Termination Fee Event, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized and
directed to immediately release the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon)
to the Purchaser.

                                   ARTICLE III
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

                The Purchaser specifically acknowledges and agrees to the
following with respect to the representations and warranties of the Sellers:

<PAGE>

                A. Purchaser will not have any recourse to any Seller or to any
of the officers, directors, members or persons acting on behalf of any Seller in
the event any of the representations and warranties made herein or deemed made
are untrue as at any time of expression thereof (other than for representations
and warranties made herein or deemed made that are untrue due to willful
misconduct or fraud) and the only remedies for a breach of such representations
and warranties (other than for representations and warranties made herein or
deemed made that are untrue due to willful misconduct or fraud) shall be the
Purchaser's option, under certain circumstances, not to close in accordance with
and subject to the limitations in Sections 7.1, 7.3 and 8.4 hereof, and, without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no remedy whatsoever for any such
breach of such representations and warranties after the Closing (other than for
representations and warranties made herein or deemed made that are untrue due to
willful misconduct or fraud).

                B. If information provided in any section of the schedule
delivered by the Sellers to the Purchaser by separate letter dated as of the
date hereof and made a part hereof (which schedule contains appropriate
references to identify the representations and warranties herein to which the
information in such schedule relates) (the "Seller Disclosure Letter") is
applicable to any other sections for which it is appropriately cross-referenced
or otherwise clearly identified as applying to another section, then such
information shall be deemed to have been provided with respect to all such
sections.

                Except as otherwise disclosed to the Purchaser in the Seller
Disclosure Letter, each of the Sellers, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Purchaser as follows:

        Section 3.1 Organization. Each Seller is a corporation or limited
liability company duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation and
has the requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted except where the failure to
be so duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller is duly qualified as a foreign limited
liability company or corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under
lease or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not individually or in the aggregate
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 3.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Subject to the
requirement that the Sellers' entry into this Agreement and each Transaction
Document to which any of them is a party be approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
each of the Sellers has the corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to enter into and to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. Subject to the entry and effectiveness of the Sale Order, this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of the
Sellers and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the Purchaser) constitutes, and upon the execution and delivery by such
Seller of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, such Transaction
Documents will constitute, a valid and binding agreement of each of the Sellers,
enforceable against each of the Sellers in accordance with their respective
terms.

<PAGE>

        Section 3.3 Consents and Approvals. To the knowledge of the Bankruptcy
Administrative Officer, no material consent, approval, authorization of,
declaration, filing, or registration with any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority is required to be made or obtained by any of the Sellers in connection
with the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which any Seller is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (a) the consents,
approvals, authorizations of, declarations, or filings with, the Bankruptcy
Court, (b) the filing of a notification and report form under the

proceeding, charges, citation, arbitration, or investigation (whether at law or
equity, before or by any Federal, state, or foreign commission, court, tribunal,
board, agency, or instrumentality, or before any arbitrator) pending or, to the

likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule, or order of any
court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
arbitrator outstanding against any Seller that would be reasonably likely to

        Section 3.7 No Default. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Seller

result of the commencement or pendency of the Chapter 11 Case or the application

any law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance, or judgment (including,
without limitation, any applicable environmental law, ordinance, or regulation)
of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, any insurance company or fire
rating agency, or any other similar board, organization or authority except for
such violations, notices, or changes that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
Except as disclosed in Section 3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or except as
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in
a Seller Material Adverse

<PAGE>

Effect and except for the Chapter 11 Case, no investigation or review by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Sellers or the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, threatened in writing nor has
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority indicated to any Seller an intention to
conduct the same. The Radio Broadcast Stations' transmitting and studio
equipment is operating in material accord with the terms and conditions of the
FCC Licenses, and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, including
without limitation all regulations concerning equipment authorization and human
exposure to radio frequency radiation. The Radio Broadcast Stations are not
causing interference in violation of FCC rules to the transmission of any other
broadcast station or communications facility and have not received any
complaints with respect thereto and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no other
broadcast station or communications facility is causing interference in
violation of FCC rules to the Radio Broadcast Stations' transmissions or the
public's reception of such transmissions.


        Section 3.9 FCC Licenses. (a) Section 1.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter identifies each of the FCC Licenses (including auxiliary licenses
associated with the Stations and any pending applications with the FCC) as to
the licensee, city of license, and call sign (or, with respect to applications
therefor, the file number assigned by the FCC to such application). The FCC
Licenses identified in Section 1.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter comprise
all of the material licenses, permits and other authorizations required from the
FCC for the normal and lawful broadcast operations of the Radio Broadcast
Stations in the manner now conducted.

                (b) No action or proceeding is pending or threatened before the
FCC or other Governmental or Regulatory Authority for the revocation,
non-renewal, suspension or adverse modification of the FCC Licenses. The public
files which are required by the FCC to be maintained by the licensee of the
Radio Broadcast Stations are current and contain all information required to be
included therein. The Sellers are current with all reports, filings and other
matters that it is required to file with the FCC and is not delinquent in the
payment of any fees and charges due to the FCC. The material required by 47
C.F.R. Section 73.3526 to be kept in the public inspection files of the Radio
Broadcast Stations is in such files.

                (c) Each of the FCC Licenses is validly issued in the name of
the Seller of the Radio Broadcast Station to which such FCC License applies.
Each of the Sellers has delivered to the Purchaser true and complete copies of
its respective FCC Licenses, including any and all amendments and other
modifications thereto. Each of the FCC Licenses is in full force and effect, is
valid for the balance of the current license term applicable generally to radio
stations licensed to communities in the state where the Radio Broadcast Station
is located, is unimpaired by any acts or omissions of the Sellers or any of
their affiliates, or the employees, agents, officers, directors, or shareholders
of the Sellers or any of their affiliates, and is free and clear of any
restrictions which would reasonably be expected to limit the full operation of
the Radio Broadcast Stations in the manner and to the full extent as now
operated (other than restrictions under the terms of the FCC Licenses themselves
or generally applicable under the rules and regulations of the FCC). The Sellers
are not aware of any reason why those of the FCC Licenses subject to expiration
would reasonably be expected not to be renewed in the ordinary course for a full
term without material qualifications, or of any reason why any of the FCC
Licenses would reasonably be expected to be revoked. Each of the Radio Broadcast
Stations is in compliance with the FCC's policy on exposure to radio frequency
radiation. No renewal of any FCC

<PAGE>

License would constitute a major environmental action under the current rules of
the FCC. To Sellers' knowledge after due inquiry, there are no facts which,
under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the existing rules of the
FCC, would disqualify any Seller from assigning its FCC Licenses or from
consummating the transactions contemplated herein within the times contemplated
herein. Access to the Radio Broadcast Stations' transmission facilities is
restricted in accordance with the policies of the FCC.

                (d) Section 1.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter accurately
identifies each of the Permits held by the Sellers. The Permits identified in
Section 1.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter comprise all of the licenses,
permits and other authorizations required for the normal and lawful operations
of the Radio Broadcast Stations in the manner now conducted, except for the FCC
Licenses and except as would not cause a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

                (e) The towers used in the operation of the Radio Broadcast
Stations are obstruction marked and lighted to the extent required by, and in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other
applicable requirements of law existing as of the date of this Agreement.
Appropriate notification to the FAA has been filed for each such tower where
required by the FCC's rules and regulations, and such tower is in full
compliance with the terms of such notification.

        Section 3.10 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in Section 3.10
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Sellers have complied in all material respects
with all Environmental Laws (as defined below) applicable to the Stations and
their operations, including but not limited to the FCC's guidelines regarding RF
radiation. The technical equipment included in the Station Assets does not
contain any PCBs. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, with respect to the periods during which Sellers owned or occupied the
property on which the Assets are situated, and to the knowledge of Sellers at no
time prior thereto, has any hazardous or toxic waste, substance, material or
pollutant (as those or similar terms are defined under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42
U.S.C. Sections 9601 et seq., Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections
2601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.
Sections 6901 et seq. or any other applicable federal, state and local
environmental law, statute, ordinance, order, judgment, rule or regulation
relating to the environment or the protection of human health (" Environmental
Laws")), including but not limited to, any asbestos or asbestos related
products, oils or petroleum-derived compounds, CFCs, PCBs, or underground
storage tanks, been released, emitted or discharged or are currently located in,
on, under, or about the real property on which the Assets are situated including
the transmitter sites or contained in the tangible personal property included in
the Assets. Sellers shall be, as of the Closing Date and thereafter, solely
responsible for all environmental liabilities, of whatsoever kind and nature,
arising out of or attributable to the operation or ownership of the Assets prior
to the Closing Date.

        Section 3.11 Employee Benefits; Labor Matters. (a) Sellers have made
available to Purchaser true and correct copies of each plan or arrangement
(including each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and
any "specified fringe benefit plan" as defined in Section 6039D of the Code)
maintained or contributed to by (i) any Seller or (ii) any entity which is (or
at the relevant time was) a member of a "controlled group of corporations" with,
under "common control" with or a member of an "affiliated service group" with,
any Seller as

<PAGE>

defined in Code Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) (an "ERISA Affiliate") and which
provides benefits to any current or former employee of any Seller employed in
connection with the operation of the Radios Broadcast Stations (collectively,
"Employee Benefit Plans"), and any other "group health plan" (as defined in
Section 607 of ERISA) sponsored by the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate.

                (b) Each Employee Benefit Plan complies in all material respects
in form and operation with all applicable law including without limitation ERISA
and the Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified. Neither the Sellers nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever contributed to a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section
3(37) or 4001(a) of ERISA and has no withdrawal liability under any such
multiemployer plan. Neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the
Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has ever maintained any employee
welfare benefit plan (as defined in ERISA) providing medical, health or life
insurance or other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or
terminated employees, their spouses, or dependents. Neither the Sellers or any
ERISA Affiliate has any announced plan or legally binding commitment to
terminate or modify any Employee Benefit Plan and Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate
shall continue to maintain a group health plan for at least eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date. It is expressly understood that Purchaser is not
assuming any obligation with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

                (c) There is no pending claim, charge or litigation relating to
the employment, termination of employment, compensation or employee benefits of
any current or former employee of any Seller, nor, to the knowledge of any
Seller or the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, is any such claim or litigation
threatened.

                (d) None of Sellers' employees is subject to or covered by a
collective bargaining agreement or a labor union agreement, and there is no
strike, dispute, slowdown, work stoppage or other concerted activity pending or
threatened against or affecting the Business, and there has been no such job
action during the past three (3) years and, to the knowledge of any Seller or
the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, no union represents, or is seeking to
represent or organize, any employee of any Seller.

                (e) Sellers have made available to Purchaser a true and correct
list of all persons employed at the Stations, including information regarding
date of hire, a description of material compensation arrangements and a
description of any other terms of any and all agreements affecting such persons
and their employment by Sellers. Except as previously disclosed in writing to
Purchaser, no persons employed at the Stations are shared with any non-Seller
third party or entity (including any radio station directly or indirectly owned
or operated by Alan Brill).

        Section 3.12 Real Property.

                (a) Section 1.1(p) of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a
true and correct list of each parcel of Real Property owned by the Sellers and
used, held for use or useable connection with the Business, and Section 1.1(q)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a true

<PAGE>

and correct list of each Real Property Lease with respect to real property
leased by the Sellers (as lessor or lessee) and used, held for use or useable

                (b) Except as disclosed in Section 3.12(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the Sellers have good, marketable and insurable title to the
Real Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. Except for the Real Property subject to Real Property Leases
described in Section 1.1(q)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Sellers are
in possession of the Real Property.

                (c) Each Real Property Lease is a legal, valid and binding
agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, of the Seller party thereto
and, except as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
there is no default (or any condition or event which, after notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) thereunder which would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect

                (d) Seller has full legal and practical access to the Real
Property, and all easements, rights of way, and real property licenses relating
thereto have been properly recorded in the appropriate public recording offices.
None of the buildings, structures, improvements or fixtures constructed on any
Real Property, including, but not limited to, all towers, guy wires and guy
anchors and ground radials, encroach upon adjoining real property, and all such
buildings, structures, improvements and fixtures are constructed and are
operated and used in conformance with all "set back" lines, easements,
covenants, restrictions and all applicable building, fire, zoning, health and
safety laws and codes. No utility lines serving the Real Property pass over the
lands of a third party except where appropriate easements have been obtained.
All buildings, structures, towers, antennae, improvements and fixtures
comprising part of the real properties owned or leased by Seller are in good and
technically sound operating condition, have no latent structural mechanical or
other defects of material significance, are reasonably suitable for the purposes
for which they are being used and each has adequate rights of ingress and
egress, utility service for water and sewer, telephone, electric and/or gas, and
sanitary service for the conduct of the Business and operations of the Radio
Broadcast Stations as presently conducted.

                (a) At the Closing, the Purchaser will acquire good, valid and
marketable title to all of the Assets, in each case free and clear of any and
all Encumbrances (including, without limitation, any and all claims that may
arise by reason of the execution, delivery or performance by the Sellers of this
Agreement) other than Permitted Encumbrances.

                (b) Except for any assets that are Excluded Assets, the Assets
include, without limitation, all real property interests and related rights and
interests and all personal property of the Sellers, both tangible and
intangible, used, held for use or usable in the operation of the Business or
necessary to the conduct of the Business as it is currently conducted by the
Sellers. Except as identified on Section 3.13(b) of the Seller Disclosure

entity (including any radio station directly or indirectly owned or operated by
Alan Brill).

<PAGE>

conduct of the Business. All such Permits are listed in Section 1.1(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and are in full force and effect. Except as set forth

to the Sellers of more than $25,000 annually;

                        (iv) all Contracts relating to the future disposition or

                (b) No Seller has received written notice, nor do the Sellers or
the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer otherwise have knowledge, that any party
to the Contracts required to be disclosed in Section 3.14 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter intends to cancel, terminate, or refuse to renew such Contract
or to exercise or decline to exercise any option or right thereunder. Each such
Contract is valid and binding upon all parties thereto in accordance with its
terms and, except as set forth in Section 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
there is no default (or any condition or event which, after notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) thereunder; except (i) to the extent
excused by or unenforceable as a result of the commencement or pendency of the
Chapter 11 Case or the application of any provision of the Bankruptcy Code and
(ii) to the extent that the failure of such Contracts to be valid and binding
would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 3.15 Intellectual Property.

                (a) "Intellectual Property" shall mean all of the following as
they exist in all jurisdictions throughout the world, in each case, to the

                        (i) patents, patent applications, and other patent

such applications and whether or not any such applications are modified,
withdrawn, or resubmitted);

                        (ii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade
names, brand names, Internet domain names, designs, logos, or corporate names,

                        (iii) copyright registrations and applications for
registration thereof and non-registered copyrights;

                        (iv) trade secrets, designs, research, processes,
procedures, techniques, methods, know-how, data, mask works, inventions, and
other proprietary rights (whether or not patentable or subject to copyright,
mask work, or trade secret protection); and

                        (v) computer software programs, including, without
limitation, all source codes, object codes, and material documentation related
thereto (the "Software").

                (b) Intellectual Property Disclosure. Section 3.15(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth all patents and patent applications,
trademark and service mark registrations and applications, Internet domain name
registrations and applications, and copyright registrations and applications
owned or licensed by any Seller, specifying as to each licensed or owned item,

of the item; (iii) the jurisdictions in which an owned item is issued or
registered or in which an application for

<PAGE>

issuance or registration has been filed; and (iv) the issuance, registration, or
application numbers and dates, or instrument by which such item has been
licensed (as applicable).

                (c) Ownership. Each Seller will own or have the right to use as
of the Closing Date and transfer to the Purchaser, free and clear of any and all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and as of the Closing Date will
have the unrestricted right to use, sell, or license, all Intellectual Property
used, held for use or useable the conduct of the Business.

                (d) Claims. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
no Seller has been, during the three (3) years preceding the date hereof, a
party to any claim or action, nor, to the knowledge of the Sellers or the
Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, is any claim or action threatened that
challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or right to use, sell, or
license any Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
to the knowledge of the Sellers or the Bankruptcy Administrative Officer, no
third party is infringing upon any Intellectual Property.

                (e) Administration and Enforcement. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Seller
Material Adverse Effect, the Sellers have taken all necessary and desirable
action to maintain and protect each item of Intellectual Property owned by the
Sellers.

        Section 3.16 Bankruptcy Administrative Officer Approval and
Recommendation. The Bankruptcy Administrative Officer as appointed pursuant to
the Revised Consent Order, dated May 16, 2002, entered in the Chapter 11 Case
(the "Bankruptcy Administrative Officer") has determined, subject to further
review and approval by the Bankruptcy Court, that an immediate sale and
assignment of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement under Sections 363 and 365
of the Bankruptcy Code is in the best interests of the Sellers.

        Section 3.17 FAA Compliance. The Radio Broadcast Stations are in
material compliance with all rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration applicable to the Stations.

        Section 3.18 Investment.

                The Sellers understand and acknowledge that (i) the Common Stock
is being issued without registration under the Securities Act in a private
placement that is exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act
under Regulation D and/or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and (ii) the
availability of any such exemption depends in part on, and the Purchaser will
rely upon the accuracy and truthfulness of, the representations set forth in
this Section 3.18. Each Seller that will be receiving stock pursuant to Section
1.7(c) (each an "Acquiring Seller") is acquiring the Common Stock for investment
for its own account and not with a view to any distribution thereof in
contravention of applicable securities laws. On the date hereof and on the
Closing Date, each Acquiring Seller is and will be an Accredited Investor. Each
Acquiring Seller has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business
and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of
the prospective investment in the Common Stock and has so evaluated the merits
and risks of such investment to

<PAGE>

its satisfaction. Each Acquiring Seller is able to bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Common Stock and is able to afford a complete loss of such
investment. Upon the confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court, and consummation, of
a chapter 11 plan of the Sellers to be filed by the Sellers and confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court (the "Bankruptcy Plan"), Acquiring Sellers shall distribute the
Stock Consideration (including any adjustment thereof after the Closing as a
result of a stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification
or recapitalization) only to those creditors of the Sellers who satisfy the
requirements set forth in Section 1.6(a) at the time of the distribution.

        Section 3.19 Access to Information.

                Each Seller acknowledges that it has been afforded (i) the

        Section 6.3 Third Party Rights. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of

        Section 6.5 Shelf Registration.

                (a) The shares of Common Stock distributed by Sellers to its
creditors in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.6(a) (the
"Registrable Shares") shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 6.5
until such shares are either (a) effectively registered under the Securities Act
and disposed of in accordance with the Registration Statement covering it, or
(b) in the opinion of counsel to Purchaser, such shares are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the
Securities Act.

                (b) Within five (5) business days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC a Shelf Registration covering the
resale of all of the Registrable Shares. "Shelf Registration" shall mean a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 (or similar rule that
may be adopted by the SEC) under the Securities Act, filed by Purchaser and
relating to the Registrable Shares. Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to cause such Shelf Registration to become effective within 45 days
after the filing with the SEC and thereafter to keep it continuously effective
until a date that is one (1) year from the effective date (subject to any
extension required by Section 6.5(c) below) or for such earlier date on which
all of the Registrable Shares covered by the Shelf Registration have been sold
pursuant to such Shelf Registration or the status of such Registrable Shares
shall otherwise have terminated as provided in Section 6.5(a) above.

                (c) Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
based on any valid business purpose (including, without limitation, (i) upon the
request of the managing underwriter in a distribution of equity securities of
Purchaser, or (ii) to avoid disclosure of any corporate development that
Purchaser is not otherwise obligated to disclose or (iii) to coordinate such
distribution with other shareholders that have registration rights with respect
to any securities of

<PAGE>

Purchaser or with other distributions of Purchaser (whether for the account of
Purchaser or otherwise)), to suspend the use of the Registration Statement for a
reasonable length of time (a "Delay Period") and from time to time. Purchaser
shall provide advance written notice to the extent reasonably possible to each
holder of Registrable Shares hereunder of the beginning and end of each Delay
Period and such holders shall cease all disposition efforts with respect to
Registrable Shares held by them immediately upon receipt of notice of the
beginning of any Delay Period. The effectiveness of the Registration Statement
shall be extended for a period of time equal to the Delay Period to allow the
shareholders to use the Registration Statement for a cumulative period of one
year unless such effectiveness is terminated at an earlier date under Section
6.5(a).

                (d) As a condition to Purchaser's obligations under this Section
6.5 to cause the Registration Statement to be filed and kept effective, each
holder of Registrable Shares shall provide such information, make such
representations, execute such documents, make such agreements (including
appropriate indemnification provisions) and take or refrain from taking such
actions, consistent with this Agreement, as may reasonably be required by
Purchaser in connection with such registration, and, each holder further agrees
not to utilize any material other than the applicable current prospectus in
connection with the offering of Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration
Statement.

at any time prior to the Closing Date by action of the Bankruptcy Administrative
Officer if: (a) there has been a breach by the Purchaser of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality

alternative proposal with respect to the Assets and the Business having been

pursuant to this clause (c) is conditioned upon the prior payment by the Sellers

termination and (ii) that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party
hereto from liability for willful breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

<PAGE>

stated below. In the event of any loss or damage to any of the Assets, Sellers
shall notify Purchaser thereof in writing immediately. Such notice shall specify
with particularity the loss or damage incurred, the cause thereof (if known or
reasonably ascertainable), and the insurance coverage. In the event that the
property is not completely repaired, replaced or restored on or before the
scheduled Closing Date, Purchaser at its option: (a) may elect to postpone
Closing until such time as the property has been completely repaired, replaced
or restored (and, if necessary, Sellers shall join Purchaser in requesting from
the FCC any extensions of time in which to consummate the Closing that may be
required in order to complete such repairs); or (b) may elect to consummate the
Closing and accept the property in its then condition, and deduct from the
Purchase Price that amount which Purchaser reasonably determines to be
sufficient to cover any remediation costs and Damages (net of such insurance
proceeds which Sellers shall pay to Purchaser and the assignment to Purchaser of
the right to any unpaid proceeds).

        Section 10.3 Descriptive Headings. The headings contained in this

meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        Section 10.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the

entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, including, without limitation, any transaction between the parties
hereto, and (b) shall not be assigned, directly or indirectly, by operation of
law or otherwise; provided, however, that the Purchaser may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to any Subsidiary, but the Purchaser shall not be
relieved of its obligations hereunder as a result of such assignment; provided,
further, however, that the certain Confidentiality and Limited Use Agreement
between certain Sellers and the Purchaser will remain in full force and effect.

        Section 10.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to

jurisdiction.

        Section 10.6 Venue and Retention of Jurisdiction. All actions brought,
arising out of, or related to the Contemplated Transactions shall be brought in
the Bankruptcy Court, and the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to
determine any and all such actions; provided, that if the Bankruptcy Court
abstains from exercising, declines to exercise or lacks jurisdiction with
respect to any such action, such abstention, refusal or lack of jurisdiction
shall have no affect upon, and shall not control, prohibit or limit the exercise
of, jurisdiction by any other court having competent jurisdiction with respect
to such action.

        Section 10.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or
not the actions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs and

hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
