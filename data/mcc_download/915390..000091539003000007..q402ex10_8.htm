be liable to the Corporation, unless, and           only to the extent, that the Court of
Chancery of Delaware or the court in which           such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite           the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the           case, the Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such           Expenses as the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.  </FONT></P>

not indemnify the Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding           (or part thereof)
initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was           approved by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything           to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Corporation shall not indemnify the           Indemnitee to the
extent the Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of           insurance, and in the
event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments           to the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed for such           indemnification payments
from the proceeds of insurance, the Indemnitee shall           promptly refund such
indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent           of such insurance
reimbursement.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Indemnification
of Expenses of Successful Party</U>. Notwithstanding any           other provision of
this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been           successful, on the
merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in           defense of any claim,
issue or matter therein, the Indemnitee shall be           indemnified against all
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in           connection therewith.
Without limiting the foregoing, if any Proceeding or any           claim, issue or matter
therein is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise           (including a disposition
without prejudice), without (i)&nbsp;an adjudication           that the Indemnitee was
liable to the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;a plea of guilty or <U>nolo</U>&nbsp;<U>contendere</U> by
the Indemnitee, (iii)&nbsp;an adjudication that           the Indemnitee did not act in
good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee           reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the           Corporation and (iv)&nbsp;with respect to
any criminal proceeding, an           adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe his or her           conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be
considered for the purposes hereof           to have been wholly successful with respect
thereto.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notification
and Defense of Claim</U>. As a condition precedent to the           Indemnitee&#146;s
right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the           Corporation in writing
as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which           indemnity will or could be
sought; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the           failure to provide such
notice to the Corporation shall not relieve the           Corporation of any liability
which it may have to the Indemnitee except to the           extent the Corporation is
actually prejudiced by such failure. With respect to           any Proceeding of which
the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be           entitled to participate
therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense           thereof at its own
expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the           Indemnitee. After
notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election           so to assume such
defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee           for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in           connection with such
Proceeding, other than as provided below in this           Paragraph&nbsp;7. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own           counsel in connection
with such Proceeding, but the fees and expenses of such           counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the           defense thereof shall be
at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the           employment of counsel by
the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation,           (ii)&nbsp;counsel to the
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there           may be a conflict of
interest or position on any significant issue between the           Corporation and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding           or (iii)&nbsp;the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume           the defense of
such Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of           counsel for
the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as           otherwise
expressly provided by this Agreement. The Corporation shall not be           entitled,
without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any           claim
brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for           the
Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause           (ii)&nbsp;above.
The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify the           Indemnitee under this
Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any           Proceeding effected without
its written consent. The Corporation shall not           settle any Proceeding in any
manner which would impose any penalty or limitation           on the Indemnitee without
the Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the           Corporation nor the
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay their consent           to any proposed
settlement.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Advancement
of Expenses</U>. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;9 of           this
Agreement, to the extent that the Corporation does not assume the defense
          pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;7 of this Agreement of any Proceeding of which the
          Corporation receives notice under this Agreement or to the extent that the
          Corporation is required to pay the expenses of the Indemnitee&#146;s own
counsel           pursuant to Paragraph 7, any Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee           in defending such Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the           final disposition of such Proceeding; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that the           payment of such Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in
advance           of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of           an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all
amounts so           advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that
the Indemnitee           is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this           Agreement. Such undertaking shall be accepted without
reference to the financial           ability of the Indemnitee to make repayment.  </FONT></P>

the Corporation, shall be made only by independent legal counsel           selected by
