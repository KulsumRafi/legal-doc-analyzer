  to directors of stock options (&quot;Options&quot;) with respect to shares of
  the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&quot;Stock&quot;). Options

  of the Act, as amended and any regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent
  that any of the provisions contained herein do not conform with Rule 16-b3 of
  the Act or any amendments thereto or any successor regulation, then the Committee
