to physically surrender this Debenture to the Company in order to effect conversions. Subject to Section 4(b), each Conversion Notice, once given, shall be irrevocable. Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding

affiliate thereof, beneficially owning (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) in excess of 9.999% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, including shares issuable
upon conversion of, and payment of interest on, the Debenture held by such Holder after application of this Section. Since the Holder will not be obligated to report to the Company the number of shares of Common Stock it may hold at the time of a
conversion hereunder, unless the conversion at issue would result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock in excess of 9.999% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock without regard to any other shares which may be beneficially owned by the
Holder or an affiliate thereof, the Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section will limit any particular conversion hereunder and to the extent that the Holder determines that the
limitation contained in this Section applies, the determination of which portion of the principal amount of the Debenture is convertible shall be the responsibility and obligation of the Holder. If the Holder has delivered a Conversion Notice for a
principal amount of the Debenture that, without regard to any other shares that the Holder or its affiliates may beneficially own, would result in the issuance in excess of the permitted amount hereunder, the Company shall notify the Holder of this
fact and shall honor the conversion for the maximum principal amount permitted to be converted on such Conversion Date in accordance with the periods described in Section 4(b) and, at the option of the Holder, either retain any principal

law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under
applicable law. Further, if the Company shall not have delivered any cash due in respect of conversion of the Debenture or as payment of interest thereon by the third Trading Day after the Conversion Date, the Holder may, by notice to the Company,
require the Company to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(c), except that for such purpose the Conversion Price applicable thereto shall be the lesser of the Conversion Price on the Conversion Date and the Conversion Price on the

open market transaction or otherwise) Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Underlying Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such conversion (a &#147;Buy-In&#148;), then the Company shall (A) pay in
cash to the Holder (in addition to any remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (x) the Holder&#146;s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product
of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder anticipated receiving from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the market price of the Common Stock at the time of the sale giving rise to such purchase obligation and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue a Debenture in the principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted conversion or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company
timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(b)(i). For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of Debentures with respect to
which the market price of the Underlying Shares on the date of conversion was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a Holder requires the Company to make payment in respect of a Buy-In for the failure to timely
deliver certificates hereunder and the Company timely pays in full such payment, the Company shall not be required to pay such Holder liquidated damages under Section 4(b)(ii) in respect of the certificates resulting in such Buy-In. </FONT></DIV>
