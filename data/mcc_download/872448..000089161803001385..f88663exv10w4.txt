                    (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MARCH 14, 2003)

      1. Purposes of the Plan. The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

            -     to attract and retain the best available personnel for
                  positions of substantial responsibility,

            -     to provide additional incentive to Employees and Consultants,
                  and

            -     to promote the success of the Company's business.

      Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options or
Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator at the time of
grant. Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

      4. Administration of the Plan.


            (a) Procedure.


                  (i) Multiple Administrative Bodies. The Plan may be
administered by different Committees with respect to different groups of Service
Providers.


                  (ii) Section 162(m). To the extent that the Administrator
determines it to be desirable to qualify Options granted hereunder as
"performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the
Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more "outside
directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                  (iii) Rule 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify
transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated
hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under
Rule 16b-3.

                  (iv) Other Administration. Other than as provided above, the
Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which committee
shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.


            (b) Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the provisions of the
Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated
by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, in
its discretion:

                  (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;


                  (ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Options and Stock
Purchase Rights may be granted hereunder;


                  (iii) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be
covered by each Option and Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;


                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>
                  (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;


                  (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent
with the terms of the Plan, of any Option or Stock Purchase Right granted
hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the
exercise price, the time or times when Options or Stock Purchase Rights may be
exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration
or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation
regarding any Option or Stock Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock
relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in
its sole discretion, shall determine;

                  (vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Option or Stock
Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of
the Common Stock covered by such Option or Stock Purchase Right shall have
declined since the date the Option or Stock Purchase Right was granted;

                  (vii) to institute an Option Exchange Program;


                  (viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and
awards granted pursuant to the Plan;


                  (ix) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations
relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans
established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under
foreign tax laws;

                  (x) to modify or amend each Option or Stock Purchase Right
(subject to Section 15(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to
extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options longer than is
otherwise provided for in the Plan;

                  (xi) to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations
by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon
exercise of an Option or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares having a
Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.

      The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on
the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All
elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made
in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary
or advisable;

                  (xii) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Option or Stock
Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator;

                  (xiii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for administering the Plan.


                                                                             -5-
<PAGE>
            (c) Effect of Administrator's Decision. The Administrator's
decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
Optionees and any other holders of Options or Stock Purchase Rights.


      5. Eligibility. Nonstatutory Stock Options and Stock Purchase Rights may
be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to
Employees.


      6. Limitations.


            (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Option Agreement as
either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market
Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under
all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such
Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this
Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order
in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be
determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

            (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option or Stock Purchase Right shall
confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's
relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in
any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such
relationship at any time, with or without cause.

            (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options:


                  (i) No Service Provider shall be granted, in any fiscal year
of the Company, Options to purchase more than 100,000 Shares.

                  (ii) In connection with his or her initial service, a Service
Provider may be granted Options to purchase up to an additional 250,000 Shares
which shall not count against the limit set forth in subsection (i) above.

                  (iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted
proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as
described in Section 13.

                  (iv) If an Option is cancelled in the same fiscal year of the
Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction
described in Section 13), the cancelled Option will be counted against the
limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the
exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a
cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.

      7. Term of Plan. Subject to Section 19 of the Plan, the Plan shall become
effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term
of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 15 of the Plan.


      8. Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Option
Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10)
years from the date of grant or


                                                                             -6-
<PAGE>
such shorter term as may be provided in the Option Agreement. Moreover, in the
case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
(10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company
or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be
five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in
the Option Agreement.

      9. Option Exercise Price and Consideration.


            (a) Exercise Price. The per share exercise price for the Shares to
be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
Administrator, subject to the following:


                  (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option


                        (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
(10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent
or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the
Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

                        (B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee
described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall
be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

                  (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share
exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a
Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based
compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share
exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.

                  (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted
with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per
Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.

            (b) Waiting Period and Exercise Dates. At the time an Option is
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be
exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the
Option may be exercised.

            (c) Form of Consideration. The Administrator shall determine the
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method
of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall
determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such
consideration may consist entirely of:

                  (i) cash;


                  (ii) check;


                  (iii) promissory note;


                                                                             -7-
<PAGE>
                  (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired
upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six
months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said
Option shall be exercised;

                  (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless
exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;


                  (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's participation
in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;


                  (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or


                  (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the
issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

      10. Exercise of Option.


            (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at
such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set
forth in the Option Agreement. Except for options granted prior to October 11,
1996, or unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Options granted
hereunder shall be tolled during any unpaid leave of absence. An Option may not
be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

      An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written
or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option Agreement) from
the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares
with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any
consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and
permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of
an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the
Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares
are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or
of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive
dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the
Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall
issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is
exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which
the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided
in Section 13 of the Plan.

      Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares
thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the
Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

            (b) Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If an
Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Optionee's death
or Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of
time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent


                                                                             -8-
<PAGE>
that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than
the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement).
In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall
remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Optionee's termination.
If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her
entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall
revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or
her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall
terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

            (c) Disability of Optionee. If an Optionee ceases to be a Service
Provider as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his
or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement
to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event
later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option
Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the
Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's
termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to
his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the
Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not
exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall
terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

            (d) Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while a Service Provider,
the Option may be exercised within such period of time as is specified in the
Option Agreement (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such
Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant), by the Optionee's estate or by a
person who acquires the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance,
but only to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death. In the
absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain
exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's termination. If, at
the time of death, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option,
the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately
revert to the Plan. The Option may be exercised by the executor or administrator
of the Optionee's estate or, if none, by the person(s) entitled to exercise the
Option under the Optionee's will or the laws of descent or distribution. If the
Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall
terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

            (e) Buyout Provisions. The Administrator may at any time offer to
buy out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted based on
such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate
to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

      11. Stock Purchase Rights.


            (a) Rights to Purchase. Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan
and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator determines
that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall advise the
offeree in writing or electronically, by means of a Notice of Grant, of the
terms, conditions and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of
Shares that the offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and
the time within which the offeree must accept


                                                                             -9-
<PAGE>
such offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of a Restricted Stock
Purchase Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.

            (b) Repurchase Option. Unless the Administrator determines
otherwise, the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall grant the Company a
repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of
the purchaser's service with the Company for any reason (including death or
Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the
Restricted Stock purchase agreement shall be the original price paid by the
purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser
to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate determined by the
Administrator.

            (c) Other Provisions. The Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall
contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the
Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.


            (d) Rights as a Shareholder. Once the Stock Purchase Right is
exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a
shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered upon
the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No adjustment
will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to
the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as provided in Section 13
of the Plan.

      12. Non-Transferability of Options and Stock Purchase Rights. Unless
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option or Stock Purchase Right may
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any
manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the
Administrator makes an Option or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such Option
or Stock Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and conditions as
the Administrator deems appropriate.

      13. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or
Asset Sale.


            (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the
shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
each outstanding Option and Stock Purchase Right, and the number of shares of
Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to
which no Options or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or which have
been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option or Stock
Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each
such outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately
adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common
Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or
decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt
of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of
stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class,
shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall


                                                                            -10-
<PAGE>
be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject
to an Option or Stock Purchase Right.

            (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each
Optionee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed
transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Optionee to
have the right to exercise his or her Option until ten (10) days prior to such
transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as
to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the
Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any
Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option or Stock Purchase Right shall lapse
as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes
place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been
previously exercised, an Option or Stock Purchase Right will terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.

            (c) Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company
with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets
of the Company, each outstanding Option and Stock Purchase Right shall be
assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor
corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event
that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or
Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to
exercise the Option or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned Stock,
including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If
an Option or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu
of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the
Administrator shall notify the Optionee in writing or electronically that the
Option or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully vested and exercisable for a
period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or
Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the
purposes of this paragraph, the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall be
considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or
right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock
subject to the Option or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the merger or
sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or
property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock
for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders
were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if
such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common
stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with
the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be
received upon the exercise of the Option or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share
of Optioned Stock subject to the Option or Stock Purchase Right, to be solely
common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market
value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the
merger or sale of assets.

      14. Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option or Stock Purchase Right
shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option or Stock Purchase Right, or such other later
date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be
provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.


                                                                            -11-
<PAGE>
      15. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.


            (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend,
alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.


            (b) Shareholder Approval. The Company shall obtain shareholder
approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply
with Applicable Laws.


            (c) Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration,
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee,
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator,
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise
the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to options granted under the
Plan prior to the date of such termination.

      16. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.


            (a) Legal Compliance. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
exercise of an Option or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of such Option
or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall
comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of
counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

            (b) Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of an
Option or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person exercising
such Option or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant at the time of any
such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and
without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.

      17. Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority
shall not have been obtained.

      18. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.


      19. Shareholder Approval. The Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is
adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the
degree required under Applicable Laws.


                                                                            -12-

II.   AGREEMENT


      1. Grant of Option. The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to
the Optionee named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Agreement
(the "OPTIONEE") an option (the "OPTION") to purchase the number of Shares, as
set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in
the Notice of Grant (the "EXERCISE PRICE"), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 15(c)
of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the terms and
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

      If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option ("ISO"),
this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section
422 of the Code. However, if this Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock
Option, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section 422(d)
it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option ("NSO").

      2. Exercise of Option.


            (a) Right to Exercise. This Option is exercisable during its term in
accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the
applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement.

            (b) Method of Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery of an
exercise notice, in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "EXERCISE NOTICE"),
which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares in
respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "EXERCISED SHARES"), and
such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be completed
by the Optionee and delivered to Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice
shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all
Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by
the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate
Exercise Price.

      No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless
such issuance and exercise complies with Applicable Laws. Assuming such
compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered
transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with respect to
such Exercised Shares.

      3. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by
any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee:


            (a) cash; or


                                                                             -2-
<PAGE>
            (b) check; or


            (c) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise
program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; or


            (d) surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares
acquired upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more
than six (6) months on the date of surrender, AND (ii) have a Fair Market Value
on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised
Shares; or

            (e) with the Administrator's consent, delivery of Optionee's
promissory note (the "NOTE") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, in the
amount of the aggregate Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares together with the
execution and delivery by the Optionee of the Security Agreement attached hereto
as Exhibit B. The Note shall bear interest at the "applicable federal rate"
prescribed under the Code and its regulations at time of purchase, and shall be
secured by a pledge of the Shares purchased by the Note pursuant to the Security
Agreement.

      4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in
any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and
may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms
of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors,
administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.

      5. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set
out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in
accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option Agreement.


      6. Tax Consequences. Some of the federal tax consequences relating to this
Option, as of the date of this Option, are set forth below. THIS SUMMARY IS
NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR
DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.


            (a) Exercising the Option.


                  (i) Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee may incur regular
federal income tax liability upon exercise of a NSO. The Optionee will be
treated as having received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax
rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised
Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise Price. If the
Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be required to
withhold from his or her compensation or collect from Optionee and pay to the
applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage of this
compensation income at the time of exercise, and may refuse to honor the
exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are not
delivered at the time of exercise.

                  (ii) Incentive Stock Option. If this Option qualifies as an
ISO, the Optionee will have no regular federal income tax liability upon its
exercise, although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised
Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate


                                                                             -3-
<PAGE>
Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to alternative minimum taxable
income for federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to alternative
minimum tax in the year of exercise. In the event that the Optionee ceases to be
an Employee but remains a Service Provider, any Incentive Stock Option of the
Optionee that remains unexercised shall cease to qualify as an Incentive Stock
Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option on
the date three (3) months and one (1) day following such change of status.

            (b) Disposition of Shares.


                  (i) NSO. If the Optionee holds NSO Shares for at least one
year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as
long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes.

                  (ii) ISO. If the Optionee holds ISO Shares for at least one
year after exercise and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on
disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal
income tax purposes. If the Optionee disposes of ISO Shares within one year
after exercise or two years after the grant date, any gain realized on such
disposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income
rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference
between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and
the aggregate Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale price of
such Shares and the aggregate Exercise Price. Any additional gain will be taxed
as capital gain, short-term or long-term depending on the period that the ISO
Shares were held.

            (c) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. If the
Optionee sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to
an ISO on or before the later of (i) two years after the grant date, or (ii) one
year after the exercise date, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company
in writing of such disposition. The Optionee agrees that he or she may be
subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income
recognized from such early disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash or out
of the current earnings paid to the Optionee.

      7. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. The Plan is incorporated herein by
reference. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their
entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Optionee with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the
Optionee's interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and
Optionee. This agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws, but not
the choice of law rules, of California.

      8. NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED SERVICE. OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED
ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT
THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED AN OPTION OR PURCHASING SHARES
HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO
NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT


                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>
AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND
SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH OPTIONEE'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE
OPTIONEE'S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT
CAUSE.

      By your signature and the signature of the Company's representative below,
you and the Company agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the
terms and conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. Optionee has
reviewed the Plan and this Option Agreement in their entirety, has had an
opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option
Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and Option Agreement.
Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions
or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan
and Option Agreement. Optionee further agrees to notify the Company upon any
change in the residence address indicated below.

      The pledged stock (together with an executed blank stock assignment for
use in transferring all or a portion of the Shares to Pledgee if, as and when
required pursuant to this Security Agreement) shall be held by the Pledgeholder
as security for the repayment of the Note, and any extensions or renewals
thereof, to be executed by Pledgor pursuant to the terms of the Option, and the
Pledge holder shall not encumber or dispose of such Shares except in accordance
with the provisions of this Security Agreement.

      2. Pledgor's Representations and Covenants. To induce Pledgee to enter
into this Security Agreement, Pledgor represents and covenants to Pledgee, its
successors and assigns, as follows:


            (a) Payment of Indebtedness. Pledgor will pay the principal sum of
the Note secured hereby, together with interest thereon, at the time and in the
manner provided in the Note.


            (b) Encumbrances. The Shares are free of all other encumbrances,
defenses and liens, and Pledgor will not further encumber the Shares without the
prior written consent of Pledgee.

            (c) Margin Regulations. In the event that Pledgee's Common Stock is
now or later becomes margin-listed by the Federal Reserve Board and Pledgee is
classified as a "lender" within the meaning of the regulations under Part 207 of
Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations
<PAGE>
("REGULATION G"), Pledgor agrees to cooperate with Pledgee in making any
amendments to the Note or providing any additional collateral as may be
necessary to comply with such regulations.

      3. Voting Rights. During the term of this pledge and so long as all
payments of principal and interest are made as they become due under the terms
of the Note, Pledgor shall have the right to vote all of the Shares pledged
hereunder.


      4. Stock Adjustments. In the event that during the term of the pledge any
stock dividend, reclassification, readjustment or other changes are declared or
made in the capital structure of Pledgee, all new, substituted and additional
shares or other securities issued by reason of any such change shall be
delivered to and held by the Pledgee under the terms of this Security Agreement
in the same manner as the Shares originally pledged hereunder. In the event of
substitution of such securities, Pledgor, Pledgee and Pledgeholder shall
cooperate and execute such documents as are reasonable so as to provide for the
substitution of such Collateral and, upon such substitution, references to
"Shares" in this Security Agreement shall include the substituted shares of
capital stock of Pledgor as a result thereof.

      5. Options and Rights. In the event that, during the term of this pledge,
subscription Options or other rights or options shall be issued in connection
with the pledged Shares, such rights, Options and options shall be the property
of Pledgor and, if exercised by Pledgor, all new stock or other securities so
acquired by Pledgor as it relates to the pledged Shares then held by
Pledgeholder shall be immediately delivered to Pledgeholder, to be held under
the terms of this Security Agreement in the same manner as the Shares pledged.

      6. Default. Pledgor shall be deemed to be in default of the Note and of
this Security Agreement in the event:


            (a) Payment of principal or interest on the Note shall be delinquent
for a period of 10 days or more; or


            (b) Pledgor fails to perform any of the covenants set forth in the
Option or contained in this Security Agreement for a period of 10 days after
written notice thereof from Pledgee.

      In the case of an event of Default, as set forth above, Pledgee shall have
the right to accelerate payment of the Note upon notice to Pledgor, and Pledgee
shall thereafter be entitled to pursue its remedies under the California
Commercial Code.

      7. Release of Collateral. Subject to any applicable contrary rules under
Regulation G, there shall be released from this pledge a portion of the pledged
Shares held by Pledgeholder hereunder upon payments of the principal of the
Note. The number of the pledged Shares which shall be released shall be that
number of full Shares which bears the same proportion to the initial number of
Shares pledged hereunder as the payment of principal bears to the initial full
principal amount of the Note.


                                                                             -2-
<PAGE>
      8. Withdrawal or Substitution of Collateral. Pledgor shall not sell,
withdraw, pledge, substitute or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the
Collateral without the prior written consent of Pledgee.


      9. Term. The within pledge of Shares shall continue until the payment of
all indebtedness secured hereby, at which time the remaining pledged stock shall
be promptly delivered to Pledgor, subject to the provisions for prior release of
a portion of the Collateral as provided in paragraph 7 above.

      10. Insolvency. Pledgor agrees that if a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding is instituted by or against it, or if a receiver is appointed for the
property of Pledgor, or if Pledgor makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the entire amount unpaid on the Note shall become immediately due and
payable, and Pledgee may proceed as provided in the case of default.

      11. Pledgeholder Liability. In the absence of willful or gross negligence,
Pledgeholder shall not be liable to any party for any of his acts, or omissions
to act, as Pledgeholder.


      12. Invalidity of Particular Provisions. Pledgor and Pledgee agree that
the enforceability or invalidity of any provision or provisions of this Security
Agreement shall not render any other provision or provisions herein contained
unenforceable or invalid.


      13. Successors or Assigns. Pledgor and Pledgee agree that all of the terms
of this Security Agreement shall be binding on their respective successors and
assigns, and that the term "Pledgor" and the term "Pledgee" as used herein shall
be deemed to include, for all purposes, the respective designees, successors,
assigns, heirs, executors and administrators.

      14. Governing Law. This Security Agreement shall be interpreted and
governed under the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules,
of California.


                                                                             -3-

                                 1996 STOCK PLAN

                    (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MARCH 14, 2003)

                       RESTRICTED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

      Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have
the same defined meanings in this Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement.

      WHEREAS the Purchaser named in the Notice of Grant, (the "PURCHASER") is
an Service Provider, and the Purchaser's continued participation is considered
by the Company to be important for the Company's continued growth; and

      WHEREAS in order to give the Purchaser an opportunity to acquire an equity
interest in the Company as an incentive for the Purchaser to participate in the
affairs of the Company, the Administrator has granted to the Purchaser a Stock
Purchase Right subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Notice of
Grant, which are incorporated herein by reference, and pursuant to this
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (the "AGREEMENT").

      NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

      1. Sale of Stock. The Company hereby agrees to sell to the Purchaser and
the Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock
(the "SHARES"), at the per Share purchase price and as otherwise described in
the Notice of Grant.


      2. Payment of Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares may be
paid by delivery to the Company at the time of execution of this Agreement of
cash, a check, or some combination thereof.


      3. Repurchase Option.


            (a) In the event the Purchaser ceases to be a Service Provider for
any or no reason (including death or disability) before all of the Shares are
released from the Company's Repurchase Option (see Section 4), the Company
shall, upon the date of such termination (as reasonably fixed and determined by
the Company) have an irrevocable, exclusive option (the "REPURCHASE OPTION") for
a period of sixty (60) days from such date to repurchase up to that number of
shares which constitute the Unreleased Shares (as defined in Section 4) at the
original purchase price per share (the "REPURCHASE PRICE"). The Repurchase
Option shall be exercised by the Company by delivering written notice to the
Purchaser or the Purchaser's executor (with a copy to the Escrow Holder) AND, at
the Company's option, (i) by delivering to the Purchaser or the Purchaser's
executor a check in the amount of the aggregate Repurchase Price, or (ii) by
cancelling an amount of the Purchaser's indebtedness to the Company equal to the
aggregate Repurchase Price, or (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii) so that
the combined payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals the aggregate
Repurchase Price. Upon delivery of such notice and the payment of the aggregate
Repurchase Price,
<PAGE>
the Company shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Shares being
repurchased and all rights and interests therein or relating thereto, and the
Company shall have the right to retain and transfer to its own name the number
of Shares being repurchased by the Company.

            (b) Whenever the Company shall have the right to repurchase Shares
hereunder, the Company may designate and assign one or more employees, officers,
directors or shareholders of the Company or other persons or organizations to
exercise all or a part of the Company's purchase rights under this Agreement and
purchase all or a part of such Shares. If the Fair Market Value of the Shares to
be repurchased on the date of such designation or assignment (the "REPURCHASE
FMV") exceeds the aggregate Repurchase Price of such Shares, then each such
designee or assignee shall pay the Company cash equal to the difference between
the Repurchase FMV and the aggregate Repurchase Price of such Shares.

      4. Release of Shares From Repurchase Option.


            (a) _______________________ percent (______%) of the Shares shall be
released from the Company's Repurchase Option [one year] after the Date of Grant
and __________________ percent (______%) of the Shares [at the end of each month
thereafter], provided that the Purchaser does not cease to be a Service Provider
prior to the date of any such release.

            (b) Any of the Shares that have not yet been released from the
Repurchase Option are referred to herein as "Unreleased Shares."

            (c) The Shares that have been released from the Repurchase Option
shall be delivered to the Purchaser at the Purchaser's request (see Section 6).

      5. Restriction on Transfer. Except for the escrow described in Section 6
or the transfer of the Shares to the Company or its assignees contemplated by
this Agreement, none of the Shares or any beneficial interest therein shall be
transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way until such Shares
are released from the Company's Repurchase Option in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution.

      6. Escrow of Shares.


            (a) To ensure the availability for delivery of the Purchaser's
Unreleased Shares upon repurchase by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase
Option, the Purchaser shall, upon execution of this Agreement, deliver and
deposit with an escrow holder designated by the Company (the "ESCROW HOLDER")
the share certificates representing the Unreleased Shares, together with the
stock assignment duly endorsed in blank, attached hereto as Exhibit A-2. The
Unreleased Shares and stock assignment shall be held by the Escrow Holder,
pursuant to the Joint Escrow Instructions of the Company and Purchaser attached
hereto as Exhibit A-3, until such time as the Company's Repurchase Option
expires. As a further condition to the Company's obligations under this
Agreement, the Company may require the spouse of Purchaser, if any, to execute
and deliver to the Company the Consent of Spouse attached hereto as Exhibit A-4.


                                                                             -2-
<PAGE>
            (b) The Escrow Holder shall not be liable for any act it may do or
omit to do with respect to holding the Unreleased Shares in escrow while acting
in good faith and in the exercise of its judgment.

            (c) If the Company or any assignee exercises the Repurchase Option
hereunder, the Escrow Holder, upon receipt of written notice of such exercise
from the proposed transferee, shall take all steps necessary to accomplish such
transfer.

            (d) When the Repurchase Option has been exercised or expires
unexercised or a portion of the Shares has been released from the Repurchase
Option, upon request the Escrow Holder shall promptly cause a new certificate to
be issued for the released Shares and shall deliver the certificate to the
Company or the Purchaser, as the case may be.

            (e) Subject to the terms hereof, the Purchaser shall have all the
rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares while they are held in
escrow, including without limitation, the right to vote the Shares and to
receive any cash dividends declared thereon. If, from time to time during the
term of the Repurchase Option, there is (i) any stock dividend, stock split or
other change in the Shares, or (ii) any merger or sale of all or substantially
all of the assets or other acquisition of the Company, any and all new,
substituted or additional securities to which the Purchaser is entitled by
reason of the Purchaser's ownership of the Shares shall be immediately subject
to this escrow, deposited with the Escrow Holder and included thereafter as
"Shares" for purposes of this Agreement and the Repurchase Option.

      7. Legends. The share certificate evidencing the Shares, if any, issued
hereunder shall be endorsed with the following legend (in addition to any legend
required under applicable state securities laws):


            THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
            RESTRICTIONS UPON TRANSFER AND RIGHTS OF REPURCHASE AS SET FORTH IN
            AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDER, A COPY OF
            WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY.

      8. Adjustment for Stock Split. All references to the number of Shares and
the purchase price of the Shares in this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or other change in the
Shares which may be made by the Company after the date of this Agreement.

      9. Tax Consequences. The Purchaser has reviewed with the Purchaser's own
tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this
investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is
relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of
the Company or any of its agents. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser
(and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Purchaser's own tax liability
that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Purchaser understands that Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "CODE"), taxes as ordinary income the difference between the
purchase price for the Shares and the Fair Market Value of the


                                                                             -3-
<PAGE>
Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse. In this context,
"restriction" includes the right of the Company to buy back the Shares pursuant
to the Repurchase Option. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser may elect
to be taxed at the time the Shares are purchased rather than when and as the
Repurchase Option expires by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code
with the IRS within 30 days from the date of purchase. The form for making this
election is attached as Exhibit A-5 hereto.

      THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE PURCHASER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY
AND NOT THE COMPANY'S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF
THE PURCHASER REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON
THE PURCHASER'S BEHALF.

      10. General Provisions.


            (a) This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive
laws, but not the choice of law rules of California. This Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Notice of Grant, represents the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the purchase of the Shares
by the Purchaser. Subject to Section 15(c) of the Plan, in the event of a
conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall
prevail. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall
have the same defined meanings in this Agreement.

            (b) Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given
by either the Company or the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally or
deposited in the U.S. mail, First Class with postage prepaid, and addressed to
the parties at the addresses of the parties set forth at the end of this
Agreement or such other address as a party may request by notifying the other in
writing.

      Any notice to the Escrow Holder shall be sent to the Company's address
with a copy to the other party hereto.

            (c) The rights of the Company under this Agreement shall be
transferable to any one or more persons or entities, and all covenants and
agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the
Company's successors and assigns. The rights and obligations of the Purchaser
under this Agreement may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the
Company.

            (d) Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this
Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision,
nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this
Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall
not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert any other legal remedy
available to it.

            (e) The Purchaser agrees upon request to execute any further
documents or instruments necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or
intent of this Agreement.


                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>
            (f) PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES
PURSUANT TO SECTION 4 HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING SERVICE AS A SERVICE
PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED OR
PURCHASING SHARES HEREUNDER). PURCHASER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE
SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED
ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT
ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH PURCHASER'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO
TERMINATE PURCHASER'S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR
WITHOUT CAUSE.

      By Purchaser's signature below, Purchaser represents that he or she is
familiar with the terms and provisions of the Plan, and hereby accepts this
Agreement subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof. Purchaser has
reviewed the Plan and this Agreement in their entirety, has had an opportunity
to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Agreement and fully
understands all provisions of this Agreement. Purchaser agrees to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the
Administrator upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Agreement.
Purchaser further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the residence
indicated in the Notice of Grant.
