     1.1.44 "Trademark(s)" shall mean one or more trademarks or trade names that
          are owned or licensed by or on behalf of Columbia or its Affiliates
          that the Parties identify pursuant to Clause 4.1 for use in connection
          with the sale or promotion of the Finished Product by Ardana in the
          Territory provided that such trademark or trade name is approved by
          any relevant Governmental Authority in the Territory in relation to
          the European Regulatory Application and any subsequent MA. As at the
          Commencement Date, the trademark "STRIANT(TM)" shall be deemed to be
          the nominated trademark of Columbia hereunder as the First Trademark
          (as defined in Clause 4.1) but it remains subject to the approval of
          the Governmental Authorities in the Territory.

2.   license/appointment

2.1  Subject to the provisions of Clause 2.2 and 2.3 Columbia hereby grants to
     Ardana for the Term an exclusive license for and in the Territory to and
     under Columbia Patent Rights and the Trademarks to develop, manufacture,
     have manufactured, use, import, have imported, market, distribute and sell
     or have marketed, distributed and sold the Product and Finished Product.
     Ardana shall only have the right to sub-license any such rights on the
     basis that Ardana shall notify Columbia of the identity of any proposed
     third party licensee and Columbia shall have [***] to approve such licensee
     (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and provided that the
     terms of appointment of such licensee shall prevent the further appointment
     of sub-licensees without first obtaining Ardana's and Columbia's prior
     written approval (which approval may be withheld by Columbia in its sole
     discretion).

2.2  Ardana undertakes and agrees that unless and until it exercises its right
     to manufacture or have manufactured Product and/or Finished Product under
     the provisions of Clause 16.5 of this Agreement it shall not utilise the
     license granted to it under Clause 2.1 to manufacture or have manufactured
     Product and/or Finished Product but instead shall obtain all of its
     requirements for the same from Columbia on the terms of Clauses 5, 7 and 10
     of this Agreement.

2.3  Ardana acknowledges that Columbia has granted to MiPharm S.p.A. a
     non-exclusive license under the Columbia Patent Rights for the sole purpose
     of manufacturing the Product in accordance with an agreement made between
     Columbia and MiPharm dated 7 May 2002 ("MiPharm Agreement"). Columbia
     agrees during the term of this Agreement not to extend the scope of the
     grant of license rights under the Columbia Patent Rights granted in the
     Territory to MiPharm beyond the manufacturing rights set out in the MiPharm
     Agreement but for the avoidance of doubt it is declared that as this
     Agreement does not include Italy in the Territory, Columbia shall be free
     to grant MiPharm marketing and distribution rights under the Columbia
     Patent Rights for Italy (and after taking into consideration Clause 3 for
     anywhere else outside the Territory if Columbia so chooses).

2.4  Columbia shall forthwith following the Commencement Date supply to Ardana a
     copy of the CMC Data forming part of the NDA Filing. As and when any
     variation to such CMC Data is made Columbia shall supply a copy thereof to
     Ardana.

2.5  As soon as Columbia UK has made the first European Regulatory Application
     Columbia shall supply to Ardana a copy of the European Regulatory
     Application. As and when any variation to the European Regulatory
     Application is made Columbia shall supply a copy thereof to Ardana.

2.6  Columbia hereby assigns to Ardana any and all copyright, database rights or
     other rights in data, know how and other intellectual property (but for the
     avoidance of doubt excluding the Columbia Patent Rights and the Trademarks)
     which subsist in or relate to the European Regulatory Application in any
     country of the Territory.

2.7  It is acknowledged and agreed that under the provision of Clause 5.1.1
     Columbia will procure that Columbia UK progresses the European Regulatory
     Application using all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an MA in
     each country of the Territory. Forthwith following the grant of each MA in
     the Territory, Columbia shall procure that Columbia UK provides Ardana with
     a copy thereof and transfers to Ardana such MA. Forthwith following the
     Commencement Date, Columbia shall procure that Columbia UK signs transfer
     forms to be used for such purposes in such circumstances to the extent that
     such transfer forms are used and are available from the relevant
     Governmental Authorities. Until the MA is granted in each country of the
     Territory,

     although Columbia UK shall be named in each European Regulatory
     Application, it shall hold the same on trust for Ardana.

2.8  Once Ardana is the MA holder in any country of the Territory:

     2.8.1 Ardana hereby grants to Columbia irrevocable permission to cross
          refer to any MA when Columbia UK is continuing with the mutual
          recognition procedure in relation to the Territory and, when Columbia
          is making Regulatory Application for Product in any country outside
          the Territory and upon Columbia's request, Ardana will, within 30 days
          of such request, supply Columbia with a copy of the MA;

     2.8.2 Ardana shall sign a transfer form to be used in the circumstances of
          Clause 16.3.3. and only in such circumstances to the extent that such
          transfer forms are used and are available from the relevant
          Governmental Authorities; and

     2.8.3 on or before the approval of the MA in the last of the Major Markets,
          and from time to time thereafter, Columbia may identify a country in
          the European Union (subject to the approval of Ardana which shall not
          be unreasonably withheld) and Ardana shall forthwith supply to
          Columbia a copy of the MA for such country. As and when any variation
          to such MA is made Ardana shall supply a copy thereof to Columbia.

2.9  Columbia undertakes and agrees that during the Term it will not, and will
     procure that its Affiliates do not, appoint any other licensee,
     distributor, reseller or other person to market, distribute and sell the
     Product or Finished Product in the Territory nor will it, and it will
     procure that its Affiliates do not, directly supply for their own account
     the Product or Finished Product to distributors, resellers or users located
     within the Territory.

2.10 Columbia shall, and Columbia shall procure that its Affiliates shall,
     during the Term promptly refer to Ardana (or as Ardana shall direct) all
     enquiries they receive for Finished Product for sale or ultimate delivery
     within the Territory.

2.11 Ardana shall exercise its rights conferred under this Clause 2 as principal
     and it shall not sell or otherwise dispose of Finished Product on behalf
     of, or in the name of Columbia or any of its Affiliates.

2.12 Ardana shall not claim any agency or other relationship which indicates any
     authority to bind Columbia or its Affiliates contractually or incur
     liabilities on behalf of Columbia or its Affiliates.

2.13 Columbia shall at its own cost and expense be solely responsible for the
     filing, prosecution and maintenance of the Columbia Patent Rights and the
     Trademarks in the Territory, and shall use its reasonable efforts to
     prosecute all patent applications forming part of Columbia Patent Rights
     and all trademark applications forming part of Trademarks in all countries
     of the Territory (including the conduct of any claims or proceedings
     relating to them including any opposition reissue or re-examination or
     proceedings). Columbia will take account of Ardana's interest hereunder
     when making any submission to a patent or trademark office in relation to
     the Columbia Patent Rights or Trademarks in the Territory.

     2.13.1 In the event that Columbia declines to pay the official fee to
          maintain any issued Columbia Patent Rights or Trademark in the
          Territory, Columbia shall provide Ardana with written notice thereof
          prior to the expiration of any deadline relating to such activities,
          but in any event at least twenty (20) Business Days prior notice. In
          such circumstances Ardana shall have the right to decide, with reason
          and with written notice thereof at least five (5) Business Days prior
          to the deadline, to require Columbia to pay such fee to maintain such
          Columbia Patent Rights or Trademark in Columbia's own name and expense
          and Columbia shall do so.

     2.13.2 In the event that Columbia declines to file or, having filed,
          declines to further prosecute and maintain any Columbia Patent Rights
          or Trademarks in the Territory, Columbia shall provide Ardana with
          written notice thereof prior to the expiration of any deadline
          relating to such activities, but in any event at least thirty-five
          (35) Business Days prior notice. In such circumstances Ardana shall
          have the right to decide, with reason and with written notice at least
          thirty (30) Business Days prior to the deadline, that

          Columbia should continue to file or prosecute such Columbia Patent
          Rights or Trademarks. Columbia shall then have the option, with at
          least twenty (20) Business Days notice to Ardana, to:

          2.13.2.1 continue to file or prosecute such Columbia Patent Rights or
               Trademarks in Columbia's own name and expense; or

          2.13.2.2 allow Ardana to file or prosecute such Columbia Patent Rights
               or Trademarks in Columbia's name and at Columbia's expense using
               counsel of Ardana's own choice, in which instance Ardana shall
               invoice Columbia for such expenses within 30 days of the end of
               each Quarter, such invoice to be payable within 30 days.

2.14 Ardana shall promptly notify Columbia in writing if it becomes aware of any
     infringement or unauthorized use by a third party of the Columbia Patent
     Rights or Trademarks in the Territory.

2.15 In the event of an infringement of the Columbia Patent Rights or Trademarks
     by a third party in the Territory, Columbia shall have first right to bring
     any action or proceedings, and shall have sole control of the conduct of
     any such proceedings, including, the right to settle them, provided such
     settlement does not adversely affect Ardana's rights and interests within
     the Territory in accordance with the following:

     2.15.1 as an exclusive licensee in the Territory, Ardana at its election
          shall have the right to be joined as a co-plaintiff and to be
          separately represented by counsel of its own choice and at its own
          cost and expense. In such a situation, if Columbia and Ardana succeed
          in any such proceedings in relation to an infringement in the
          Territory, whether at trial or by way of settlement, in obtaining a
          financial payment to Columbia and/or Ardana:

          2.15.1.1 Columbia shall first deduct for itself all of its costs and
               expenses incurred in relation to such proceedings; and

          2.15.1.2 Ardana shall then be entitled for itself all of its costs and
               expenses incurred in relation to such proceedings; and

          2.15.1.3 either if in such proceedings a court has allocated damages
               to Columbia and Ardana respectively each shall be entitled to
               retain such damages within the Territory subject to the
               provisions of sub-clauses 2.15.1.1 and 2.15.1.2 or, if in such
               proceedings a court has not so allocated damages within the
               Territory the Parties shall share such damages [***], subject to
               the provisions of sub-clauses 2.15.1.1 and 2.15.1.2;

     2.15.2 if Ardana elects not to be joined as a co-plaintiff and not to be
          separately represented, Ardana shall, at Columbia's reasonable request
          and expense, provide Columbia with reasonable assistance in relation
          to such action or proceedings in the Territory. If Columbia succeeds
          in any such proceedings in relation to an infringement in the
          Territory, whether at trial or by way of settlement, in obtaining a
          financial payment to Columbia, Columbia shall first deduct for itself
          all of its costs and expenses incurred in relation to such proceedings
          in the Territory, and, in the event of any balance remaining in
          relation to the Territory, [***] shall be allocated to Columbia and
          [***] to Ardana;

     2.15.3 If Columbia fails to institute an action or proceeding in relation
          to an infringement in the Territory for more than [***] from becoming
          aware of the infringement pursuant to this Clause 2.15 and if Ardana
          wishes to do so, Ardana shall so notify Columbia and Ardana shall have
          the right to do so and Columbia shall do all such acts and things at
          Ardana's cost and expense as Ardana shall reasonably request to assist
          Ardana in such proceedings, including, lending its name to such
          proceedings. Ardana shall have sole control of the conduct of any such
          proceedings, including the right to settle them, provided such
          settlement does not adversely affect Columbia's rights and interests
          outside of the Territory, and shall be entitled to retain any
          financial payment awarded in such proceedings or agreed in any such
          settlement for its own account. Columbia shall do all such acts and
          things and sign all such documents as may be necessary to give Ardana
          the full benefit of this Clause 2.15.4.

2.16 If during the Term, either Party receives any notice, claim or proceedings
     from any third party alleging infringement of that third party's Patent
     Rights or trademarks by reason of any Party's activities in relation to
     this Agreement, then the Party receiving that notice shall:

     2.16.1 forthwith notify the other Party of the notice, claim or proceeding;

     2.16.2 neither Party shall make any admission of liability;

     2.16.3 the Parties shall consult with each other, taking advice from their
          patent or trademark attorneys as to whether they consider the third
          party intellectual property infringed and if so whether the claim of
          infringement is valid;

     2.16.4 in the event that the Parties consider that there is infringement of
          such third party's intellectual property rights in relation to the
          Territory, the Parties shall discuss in good faith whether to design
          around or to challenge the same. If the Parties agree that it is not
          possible or commercially reasonable to design around such third party
          intellectual property, or cannot so agree, and, nevertheless, agree to
          defend the incoming infringement claim from the third party, the
          Parties shall do so using a single counsel to be jointly appointed by
          them at their joint cost and expense. Alternatively, the Parties may
          agree to seek a license from such third party in which case Columbia
          shall be responsible for doing so. If the Parties can obtain a license
          upon terms acceptable to each Party in its sole discretion, at that
          time the Parties shall agree on any fees and royalties that are
          necessary to obtain and maintain such a license which shall be shared
          between the Parties in proportions which are agreed between them in
          good faith which proportions are fair and equitable between them
          reflecting the respective value of the license to them.

4.   TRADEMARKS

4.1  The Parties agree that, subject to consultation through the Committee, it
     shall be Columbia's responsibility and expense to provide a single
     Trademark (the "First Trademark") for Finished Product satisfactory to the
     Governmental Authorities in the Territory which can be used for launch of
     such Finished Product in the Territory. For the avoidance of doubt it is
     declared and agreed that subject to the views of such Governmental
     Authorities, this may or may not be the Trademark STRIANT. If at any time
     thereafter Columbia or Ardana desires Ardana to sell the Product in the
     Territory under a trademark other than the First Trademark, Columbia or
     Ardana, as the case may be, shall send written notice to the other
     requesting a Committee meeting to consider the selection of a different
     Trademark. In the event a different Trademark is proposed by a Party: (i)
     the different Trademark (the "New Trademark") must be acceptable to
     Columbia (acting reasonably) having regard to Columbia's desire to have a
     global Trademark, (ii) the New Trademark must be acceptable to the
     Government Authority in each jurisdiction where a use of the New Trademark
     would require making the change to the applicable Regulatory Application or
     Regulatory Approval, (iii) all costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
     for filing and prosecuting applications to register, and maintaining
     registration of such New Trademark in the Territory will be paid by (A)
     Ardana, if Ardana requested the New Trademark, or (B) Columbia, if Columbia
     requested the New Trademark, and (iv) any New Trademarks shall be
     registered in the name of, be owned by and be the sole

     property of Columbia and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
     this Clause 4.

4.2  In relation to any Trademark other than the First Trademark, if any
     Governmental Authority in any country of the Territory insists on the use
     of a trademark other than such Trademark in such country, Columbia or
     Ardana, as the case may be, shall send written notice to the other
     requesting a Committee meeting to consider the issue. At such Committee
     meeting the Parties shall agree either (i) that the country in question is
     sufficiently significant that the Trademark should be changed in all
     countries of the Territory (in which case the terms set out in Clause
     4.1(i) (ii) and (iv) shall apply) or (ii) that the preferable course is to
     adopt a different trademark only in such country (in which case the term
     set out in Clause 4.1(iv) shall apply). In either case all costs (including
     reasonable attorneys' fees) for filing and prosecution any new trademark
     applications will be shared equally by the Parties.

4.3  Ardana agrees to Commercialize Finished Product solely under the Trademark.
     Ardana shall ensure that each reference to and use of the Trademark by
     Ardana in any marketing material related to the Finished Product is
     acceptable to Columbia as specified in Clause 4.6 and is accompanied by an
     acknowledgement that the Trademark is a trademark or registered trademark
     owned by Columbia and used by Ardana under license.

4.4  The initial Trade Dress for the Finished Product shall be as set out in the
     European Regulatory Application. Once Ardana is the MA holder it may
     request Columbia to modify or alter the Trade Dress for the Finished
     Product. In such a case Columbia shall implement such modifications or

     Manual relating to the manner of use of the Trademark, and may update the
     Trademark Usage Manual from time to time as Columbia finds appropriate and

4.6  A copy of the marketing material (which the Parties agree may be in draft
     layout) using or otherwise containing the Trademarks in the form to be
     distributed, referenced or otherwise used by Ardana in connection with its
     Commercialization of the Product shall be provided to Columbia not less
     than thirty (30) days before Ardana intends to release, distribute,
     reference or use such material and Columbia shall have fifteen (15)
     Business Days from receipt of the same to provide Ardana with any comments
     or suggested amendments in relation to the use of the Trademark. Ardana
     shall take such reasonable comments or suggested amendments into account

     holder of the MA in the Territory shall be in as large a typeface and in as
     prominent a position as is required and/or is permissible under the
     Applicable Law of each country of the Territory. Save to the extent Ardana
     may be required to do so by a Governmental Authority or pursuant to the
     requirements of the MA, Ardana shall not alter the Packaging or Labelling
     of the Product nor shall Ardana conceal or otherwise obscure, remove or
     otherwise interfere with the Trademarks or other markings, which Columbia,
     in its sole discretion, may include on the Packaging or Labelling of the

     Trademarks by Ardana shall be for the benefit of Columbia and any goodwill
     accrued in connection with the use and display of the Trademarks shall
     accrue solely to the benefit of Columbia and not Ardana. In the event
     Ardana acquires any rights relating to the Trademark for any reason, Ardana
     agrees to assign to Columbia, at no cost to Columbia, all such rights,
     together with any related goodwill. Ardana shall not do or perform any act
     that may endanger,

     otherwise invalidate any registration relating to the Trademarks or cause
     the applicable registrar to require a disclaimer of exclusive rights in
     such Trademarks nor assist any other person or other entity, directly or
     indirectly, in so doing. Ardana will, at any time, upon the request of
     Columbia, execute any documents reasonably required by Columbia to confirm
     Columbia's ownership of all such rights in the Trademarks.

     in its own name nor attempt to register any trademarks, marks, or trade
     names confusingly similar to the Trademarks.

     foregoing representation and warranty from time to time in writing, as
     Columbia shall request.

          increase shall be no greater than the increase in [***] for the
          previous 12 month period;

     7.1.4 for the avoidance of doubt any increase in the Purchase Price
          pursuant to this Clause 7.1 shall only apply to the extent of any
          increase in the price of supply of Product to Columbia.

7.2  Columbia shall keep and shall procure that its Affiliates, agents,
     distributors and subcontractors keep true and accurate records and books of
     account containing all data necessary for the verification by Ardana under
     sub-clauses 7.1.1 to 7.1.4. Those records and books of account shall be
     kept for seven (7) years following the end of the year to which they
     relate. Upon Ardana's (the "Assessing Party") written request a firm of
     accountants appointed by agreement between the Parties (or, failing such
     agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the initiation of discussions
     between them on this point and at the request of either Party by the
     President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
     England and Wales in London) shall carry out a review procedure in relation
     to Columbia's (the "Assessed Party") cost of obtaining Finished Product as
     follows:

<PAGE>

     7.2.1 such firm of accountants shall be given access to and shall be
          permitted to examine such books and records upon twenty (20) Business
          Days notice having been given by the Assessing Party and at all
          reasonable times on Business Days for the purpose of certifying to the
          Assessing Party that Columbia applied the provisions of sub-clauses
          7.1.1 to 7.1.4;

     7.2.2 prior to any such examination taking place, such firm of accountants
          shall undertake to the Assessed Party in a deed that they shall keep
          all information and data contained in such books and records, strictly
          confidential and shall not disclose such information or copies of such
          books and records to any third person including the Assessing Party,
          but shall only use the same for the purpose of the calculations which
          they need to perform in order to issue the certificate to the
          Assessing Party which this Clause 7.2 envisages;

     7.2.3 any such access examination and certification shall occur no more
          frequently than once per year and will not go back over records more
          than two (2) years old unless a discrepancy is found;

     7.2.4 the Assessed Party shall make available personnel to answer queries
          on all books and records required for the purpose of the
          certification;

     7.2.5 if the certification shows that the Assessed Party has not applied
          the provisions of sub-clauses 7.1.1 to 7.1.4 the Parties shall
          forthwith recalculate the price which should have been paid by Ardana
          and any monies which such recalculation shows as being due and owing
          by one Party to the other shall be paid by that Party. The cost of the
          accountant shall be the responsibility of the Assessed Party if the
          recalculation shows that the Assessed Party has charged the Assessing
          Party a price more than [***] in excess of the recalculated price and
          the responsibility of the Assessing Party otherwise.

7.3  Upon shipment of Product to Ardana, Columbia shall submit invoices therefor
     to Ardana. Ardana shall pay each invoice in full within thirty (30) days
     after the date of invoice. All payments shall be made in Euros.

<PAGE>

7.4  It is acknowledged and agreed that the Minimum Purchase Requirements
     operate as follows: if in any year following the date of First Commercial
     Sale Ardana has not purchased from Columbia the volume of Product set out
     in the Minimum Purchase Requirements for that year because of lack of
     market demand or other reason. In such circumstances Ardana shall at its
     option:

     7.4.1 issue a Purchase Order or Purchase Orders to Columbia in accordance
          with the procedures set out in Clause 10 for the outstanding
          quantities for delivery during that year in which case there shall be
          no breach of this Agreement by Ardana; or

     7.4.2 fail to purchase the outstanding quantities during such year in which
          case Ardana shall be in material breach of this Agreement and the
          remedy provisions of Clause 16.1.1 shall not apply.

7.5  No later than 180 days before the end of the [***] period commencing on the
     date of First Commercial Sale and covered by the Minimum Purchase
     Requirements the Parties shall meet and shall seek to agree Minimum
     Purchase Requirements for the [***] of this Agreement. If the Parties fail
     to agree such new Minimum Purchase Requirements on or before 90 days before
     the end of [***] the setting of the Minimum Purchase Requirements for the
     [***] period shall be referred to the Expert's Decision. In making this
     decision the expert shall:

     7.5.1 invite written submissions from each of the Parties putting forward
          justification for the Minimum Purchase Requirements which they are
          proposing; and

     7.5.2 invite oral submissions of no more than [***] utilising whatever
          experts the Parties so choose putting forward justification for the
          Minimum Purchase Requirements which they are proposing.

8.   COMMERCIALISATION COMMITTEE

8.1  Ardana and Columbia shall create a Commercialisation Committee (the
     "Committee") to consist initially of two persons as voting members
     ("Members"), one of whom shall be nominated by Ardana and one of whom shall
     be nominated by Columbia. Each

                                       33

    [***] A CONFIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED
     SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

<PAGE>

     Member shall be entitled to exercise one (1) vote each on the Committee,
     whether or not present at any Committee meeting. Columbia shall also be
     entitled to appoint one of its nominees to be the chairman of the Committee
     ("Chairman"). In the event of a deadlock in relation to those issues set
     out in Clauses 8.6, the Chairman shall be entitled to cast the deciding
     vote. The Committee will meet no less frequently then [***].

8.2  Each of Ardana and Columbia shall be entitled to remove their Member and
     appoint a replacement therefor. The number of Members may be altered if
     agreed to by Ardana and Columbia in writing; provided, however, that, each
     of Ardana and Columbia shall be entitled to appoint an equal number of
     Members.

8.3  The quorum for meetings of the Committee shall be two (2) Members. The
     venue for meetings not held by teleconference shall alternate between the
     offices of Ardana in Edinburgh, Scotland and the offices of Columbia's
     Affiliate in Livingston, New Jersey or such other venue as may be agreed.
     Each party shall be responsible for its own expenses including travel and
     accommodation costs incurred in connection with Committee meetings.

8.4  The Committee shall have power to invite persons whose special skills or
     influence might advance the Commercialisation of the Product, in confidence
     and upon behalf of the Committee, to attend and address meetings of the
     Committee. Each party shall give the other reasonable advance notice of the
     identity of any such additional attendees which it intends to participate
     in the Committee meeting in question. For the avoidance of doubt it is
     agreed that such persons shall not be Members and shall not have a right to
     vote or participate in the decision making process of the Committee.

8.5  The Chairperson shall take responsibility for promptly preparing the
     minutes of any Committee meeting, receiving approval of those minutes from
     the other Committee Member who participated in the meeting, obtaining each
     Member's signature on the approved minutes and promptly distributing a copy
     of the signed minutes to each Party.

<PAGE>

8.6  The Committee shall be a co-ordination, liaison and communication forum in
     relation to the global issues relating to Product and shall only be a
     decision making forum in relation to strategic regulatory issues affecting
     the Product, provided, always, that Ardana shall never be required to agree
     to or implement any decision of the Committee which would be contrary to
     Ardana's responsibilities as the holder of the MAs in the Territory or to
     Applicable Laws.

9.   CLINICAL STUDIES, TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS

9.1  Either Party (the "Initiating Party"), may from time to time, propose to
     the other Party that additional clinical trials, studies or investigations
     be initiated in relation to the Product including adding a further
     indication to the European Regulatory Application or the MAs ("Additional
     Studies"). The Parties shall meet and discuss the same in good faith and if
     the Parties agree the plans and protocols for such Additional Studies
     (including which Party shall be the sponsor of such Additional Studies) and
     the cost of such Additional Studies will be shared equally between the
     Parties. If the Parties do not agree to jointly fund such Additional
     Studies then the provisions of Clause 9.2 and 9.3 shall apply.

9.2  If Ardana is the Initiating Party it shall obtain the prior written
     approval of Columbia, which approval may be withheld by Columbia for any
     reason or no reason, on the proposed Additional Studies prior to initiating
     such Additional Studies and shall prepare, maintain and deliver to
     Columbia, complete and accurate copies of records and reports, including
     progress, safety and final reports. Columbia shall reasonably cooperate and
     assist Ardana in obtaining any Regulatory Approvals required for additional
     indications or other revised Labelling of Product in the Territory
     justified by the outcome of such Additional Studies, including attendance
     at meetings with relevant Governmental Authorities and Ardana shall file
     (if applicable) variations to the MAs and use its reasonable efforts to
     obtain such variations to the MAs relating to such Additional Studies at
     its own cost and expense.

9.3  If Columbia is the Initiating party, Columbia shall give Ardana the
     opportunity to comment upon such Additional Studies and shall keep Ardana
     informed of the progress of such Additional Study and shall provide to
     Ardana a written report of the outcome of such Additional Studies. Columbia
     shall prepare, maintain and deliver to

                                       35

    [***] A CONFIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED

<PAGE>

     Ardana, complete and accurate copies of records and reports, including
     progress, safety and final report. Columbia shall reasonably cooperate and
     assist Ardana in obtaining any variations to the MAs required for
     additional indications or other revised Labelling of Product in the
     Territory justified by the outcome of such Additional Studies including
     attendance at meetings with relevant Governmental Authorities and Ardana
     shall file (if applicable) for such variations to the MAs and use its
     reasonable efforts to obtain such variations to the MAs relating to such
     Additional Studies at its own cost and expense.

9.4  Where Ardana is the Initiating Party a final report of the Additional Study
     results from all Additional Study sites shall be prepared by Ardana and
     reviewed by Columbia, and may thereafter be released or submitted for
     publication by Ardana for use at conferences and publication in scientific
     journals.

9.5  All rights in and to any data, results, information, inventions,
     discoveries and/or improvements arising out of the performance of an
     Additional Study, whether patentable or not, conceived, made, obtained or
     developed ("the Data Package") pursuant to an Additional Study shall vest
     in and remain the property of Columbia, provided always that the rights in
     such Data Package shall be the subject of the license to Ardana under
     Clause 2.1 and the assignment to Ardana under Clause 2.6. If Columbia uses
     the Data Package outside the Territory by licensing or otherwise
     authorising the use of the same by a third party (including the appointment
     of a distributor):

     9.5.1 if such Data Package has been generated pursuant to an Additional
          Study funded by Ardana then notwithstanding that Columbia owns such
          rights in such Data Package in the event that Columbia grants to a
          third party any such rights to use such Data Package it shall pay to
          Ardana one hundred percent (100%) of the consideration received from
          such third party for the right to use such Data Package;

     9.5.2 if such Data Package has been generated pursuant to an Additional
          Study funded jointly between Ardana and Columbia then in the event
          that Columbia grants to a third party any right to use such Data
          Package it shall

          pay to Ardana fifty per cent (50%) of the consideration received from
          such third party for the grant of the right to use such Data Package.

10.  FORECASTS; ORDERS; DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

10.1 No later than three months prior to the anticipated date of First
     Commercial Sale of Finished Product in the Territory and each Quarter
     thereafter, Ardana shall prepare and provide Columbia with a written
     forecast by Quarter of its requirements for Product ("Forecasts") for the
     immediately succeeding four full Quarters, including, with respect to the
     first Forecast, the period between the anticipated date of First Commercial
     Sale and the beginning of the first Quarter following First Commercial
     Sale. The amounts set forth for the first Quarter in each Forecast shall
     constitute a firm purchase order and shall be binding upon Ardana. The
     amounts set forth in the following three (3) Quarters shall constitute
     Ardana's non-binding, good faith estimate of the Product requirements of
     Ardana for such periods; provided, however, that in relation to the amounts
     set forth for the second Quarter when such Quarter becomes the first
     Quarter of the next Forecast the amounts set forth in such first Quarter
     shall not be less than eighty percent (80%) nor shall Columbia be obligated
     to supply greater than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the amounts set
     forth in the immediately preceding Forecast for such Quarter, but Columbia
     may agree to supply such greater amount in its sole discretion.

10.2 Each firm purchase order provided to Columbia by Ardana pursuant to Clause
     10.1 above shall be in writing and shall specify the description of the
     Finished Product ordered, the quantity ordered, the price and required
     delivery date therefore ("Purchase Order"). In the event of a conflict
     between the terms and conditions of any Purchase Order and this Agreement,
     the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail. Columbia shall
     have no obligation to supply quantities of Finished Product (i) in the
     event Ardana places orders for amounts of Product that are smaller than
     Columbia or its contract manufacture standard manufacturing batch size for
     the Product and the amount of Product remaining after filling orders from
     other Columbia customers are not available in sufficient quantity to fill
     the order placed by Ardana; or (ii) in relation to quantities of Finished
     Product specified in the Purchase Order in excess of one hundred and twenty
     percent (120%) the quantities specified in the previous Forecast for such
     Quarter provided under Clause 10.1 above.

<PAGE>

10.3 Columbia shall within ten (10) days of the receipt of any Purchase Order
     from Ardana made pursuant to Clause 10.2 give written notice to Ardana if
     it cannot fulfil such Purchase Order and the provisions of Clause 16.1
     shall apply.

10.4 All Finished Product supplied under this Agreement shall be delivered Ex
     Works (INCOTERMS 2000) Columbia's or its nominee's manufacturing and/or
     distribution facility in Europe and shall be accompanied by a written
     certificate of analysis signed by the Qualified Person confirming that such
     quantity of Finished Product meets the Specification. Ardana shall secure
     transport and insurance with its own providers at its sole cost and
     expense. Ardana shall pay all freight, insurance charges, taxes, import and
     export duties, inspection fees and other charges applicable to the sale and
     transport of Finished Product purchased by Ardana hereunder which amounts
     shall be separately set forth on Columbia's invoices to Ardana. Title and
     risk of loss and damages to Finished Product purchased by Ardana hereunder
     shall pass to Ardana upon receipt of the Finished Product by the carrier
     designated by Ardana at Columbia's facility. Columbia acknowledges that it
     shall be obliged to supply Finished Product to Ardana from a manufacturing
     and/or distribution facility in Europe. In the event that Columbia
     manufactures or has manufactured the Finished Product outside Europe it
     shall so notify Ardana and the delivery terms set out in this Clause 10.4
     shall be amended such that Columbia shall supply Finished Product to Ardana
     CIF (INCOTERMS 2000) to a delivery site in Europe and provided that such
     Finished Product is released in the Territory by a Qualified Person in the
     Territory. For the avoidance of doubt this shall not result in any change
     to the Purchase Price.

10.5 Following receipt of a shipment of Finished Product from Columbia, Ardana
     or its designated agent shall, within thirty (30) days, carry out a visual
     inspection (as defined below) of such shipment to ensure that Packaging and
     Labelling of Finished Product has taken place in accordance with the
     Specification and is accompanied by an associated Certificate of Analysis
     and if Ardana determines in its sole discretion (exercised reasonably) that
     it has not so taken place it shall promptly notify rejection of shipment to
     Columbia in writing. Subject to the provisions of Clause 10.7, if Ardana
     does not notify Columbia of rejection of such shipment within such thirty
     (30) days, such shipment of Finished Product shall be deemed to have been
     accepted.

<PAGE>

10.6 For the purposes of this Agreement, "visual inspection" shall mean:

     10.6.1 comparing the applicable order against the documentation
          accompanying the shipment to verify that the delivery date, identity,
          quantity and exterior shipment labelling comply with the order;

     10.6.2 verifying that the Certificate of Analysis for the shipment states
          that the Product conforms in all material respects to the applicable
          Specifications; and

     10.6.3 visually inspecting the exterior of the shipment of Finished
          Products to verify that the shipment appears to be in good condition.

     For the avoidance of doubt, visual inspection does not include laboratory
     analysis.

10.7 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Columbia shall remain liable to Ardana to
     the extent provided in Clause 10.8 or 10.9 as appropriate for any latent
     defect that subsequently is discovered which renders the Finished Product
     unsaleable, if such defect is due to the failure of the Finished Product to
     meet Specification and/or cGMP and provided that Ardana immediately inform
     Columbia by a notice in writing of such defect and rejection of the
     relevant shipment not later than ten (10) days from the date of discovery
     of such latent defect.

10.8 Within 10 days of receipt by Columbia of a notice of rejection from Ardana
     in accordance with Clauses 10.5 or 10.7 Columbia shall indicate in writing
     to Ardana whether Columbia is issuing a return authorisation or not. In the
     event that a return authorisation is so issued Ardana shall return to
     Columbia at Columbia's expense the quantities of Finished Product in
     question and Columbia shall replace such quantities within sixty (60) days
     or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. If the payment in respect
     of such quantities is outstanding, it shall be postponed until such
     replacement quantities are received and accepted by Ardana in accordance
     with this Clause 10.

10.9 After receipt of any rejection notice from Ardana pursuant to Clause 10.5
     or Clause 10.7 if Columbia does not issue a return authorisation under
     Clause 10.8, Columbia shall analyze any batch of Finished Product rejected
     by Ardana for nonconformity

                                       39

<PAGE>

     with the Specifications within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice,
     and present its findings with respect to such Finished Product to Ardana.
     If such tests confirm non-conformity with the Specification Columbia shall
     promptly supply to Ardana (at Columbia's cost and expense) a conforming
     batch in the same quantity as the rejected batch and shall reimburse Ardana
     for any out of pocket costs or expenses incurred by Ardana including
     shipping charges in relation to such non-conforming batch. If the Parties
     cannot agree on whether the batch of Finished Product in question conforms
     to the Specifications, an independent qualified laboratory reasonably
     acceptable to both Parties, and at a cost equally shared by both Parties,
     shall analyze both Ardana's and Columbia's samples of Product in question,
     and the definitive results of such laboratory shall be binding on the
     Parties. If the batch of Finished Product in question is determined to be
     nonconforming, such nonconforming Finished Product shall be held for
     Columbia's disposition, or shall be returned to Columbia, in each case at
     Columbia's expense, as directed by Columbia no later than fifteen (15) days
     following such determination. Columbia shall replace each nonconforming
     batch of Finished Product, or the nonconforming portion thereof, with
     conforming Finished Product within sixty (60) days or as soon as reasonably
     practical after receipt of notice of rejection thereof. If the batch of
     Finished Product in question is determined to be conforming and provided
     that the Certificate of Analysis did not indicate it to be nonconforming,
     such Finished Product shall be returned to Ardana at Ardana's cost and
     expense.

10.10 Columbia shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to establish or
     have established a second manufacturing site for of the Finished Product.

10.11 Columbia shall, at its own cost and expense hold for Ardana [***] stocks
     of Finished Product for each of the Major Markets at levels commensurate
     with the quantities ordered by Ardana in its previous Quarterly Purchase
     Order for Finished Product in such country. In the event that Columbia is
     forced to supply these safety stocks to Ardana in order to meet Ardana's
     Purchase Order(s) in circumstances where Columbia cannot replenish these
     safety stocks as a result of any failure of Columbia's contract
     manufacturer to supply Columbia with Finished Product manufactured in
     accordance with cGMP and to Specification for whatever reason, such failure
     to replenish the safety stocks shall not constitute a breach of this Clause
     10.11 by

                                       40

     SEPERATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

<PAGE>

     Columbia provided always that Columbia shall replenish such safety stocks
     as soon reasonably practicable.

10.12 Columbia shall employ stock rotation methods and techniques consistent
     with Good Industry Practice so as to ensure that Finished Product delivered
     to Ardana has a minimum of [***] of its shelf life unexpired.

11.  REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS

11.1 Except as may otherwise be agreed, Ardana shall refer any significant
     complaints or reports of incidents which it or any of its Affiliates
     receives concerning the Finished Product affecting quality to Columbia
     within four (4) working days of Ardana's receipt of the same, provided,
     that all complaints concerning suspected or actual Finished Product
     tampering, contamination or mix-up shall be delivered within one (1)
     working day of receipt of the same by Ardana or any Affiliate or
     subcontractor of Ardana. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any
     such complaint amounts to or relates to an Adverse Reaction the terms of
     the pharmacovigilance procedures to be agreed by the Parties pursuant to
     Clause 11.2 shall apply in relation to such complaint: in the event of any
     inconsistency between the application of this Clause 11.1 and such
     pharmacovigilance procedures, the terms of such pharmacovigilance procedure
     shall prevail.

11.2 The Parties agree that within nine months of the Commencement Date they
     shall agree on a product recall procedure, subject always to the other
     provisions of this Agreement, a Packaging and Labelling procedure, and a
     pharmacovigilance procedure, all in accordance with Applicable Laws.

11.3 Notwithstanding that the Parties shall agree upon product recall procedure
     pursuant to Clause 11.2, the Parties agree that the costs of recall shall
     be met as follows: if a recall arises due to any act or omission by Ardana
     the cost of goods sold, distribution expenses and third-party recall
     expenses (collectively, the "Recall Costs") shall be borne by Ardana; if a
     recall arises from any other reason then the Recall Costs shall be borne by
     Columbia. Ardana shall maintain records of all sales of Product and
     customers sufficient for Ardana (as appropriate) to adequately administer a
     recall for the period required by Applicable Law.

<PAGE>

11.4 Within 9 months (or such other period as is agreed by the Parties) of the
     Commencement Date the Parties shall agree upon a technical agreement as
     required pursuant to Directive 2001/83.

11.5 In addition to the requirements of Clauses 11.1 and 11.3 and the items

          obligation binding upon such Party and enforceable in accordance with
          its terms. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by

          case and that it has the authority to act as agent for Columbia UK in
          the matters specified in this Agreement and the corporate power to
          procure Columbia UK as specified in this Agreement. Columbia further
          hereby warrants and undertakes that at the Commencement Date that save
          as otherwise disclosed to Ardana in writing it has not assigned,
          licensed, mortgaged, charged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered
          the right, title or interest in the Columbia Patent Rights and that so
          far as it is aware the exercise by Ardana of its rights hereunder
          shall not infringe the Patent Rights or trademarks or other
          intellectual property rights of any third party;

          standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
          incorporated; and

     13.1.5 the execution and delivery of this agreement and the performance of
          such Party's obligations do not constitute a default or require any
          consent under any other contractual obligation of such Party.

13.2 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT COLUMBIA MAKES NO
     WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, WITH RESPECT TO THE
     PRODUCT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
     MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, USE, PERFORMANCE,
     NON-INFRINGEMENT OR PATENTABILITY AND ANY SUCH WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY

13.3 Subject to the provisions of Clause 13.4 and 13.5 Columbia shall be
     responsible for and shall indemnify Ardana and its directors, officers,
     servants and agents (collectively "the Indemnified Party") against any and
     all liability, loss, damage, cost and expense (including legal costs)
     incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of

     13.3.1 that part of any claim brought against Ardana by a Third Party which
          arises as a result of any activities of Columbia, its Affiliates or
          contract

          that use of any Finished Product(s) has caused death or bodily injury;
          or

     13.3.2 a breach of warranty by Columbia under Clauses 13.1.

     An Indemnified Party that intends to claim indemnification under this
     Clause 13.3 shall promptly notify Columbia of any Third Party claim in
     respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim that
     indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle the
     claim prior to any such notice. Columbia may assume and control the defence
     of any such Third Party claim, provided however, that an Indemnified Party
     shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own cost and expense,
     if representation of that Indemnified Party by the counsel retained by
     Columbia would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
     interests between the Indemnified Party and any other party represented by
     that counsel in the proceedings. The Indemnified Party shall co-operate
     with Columbia and its legal representatives in the investigation of any
     matter covered by this indemnification.

13.4 Subject to the provisions of Clause 13.5, Ardana shall be responsible for

     incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party

     13.4.1 as a result of that part of any claim brought against Columbia or
          its Affiliates by a Third Party which arises as a result of the
          activities by Ardana or its affiliates, sublicensees, distributors or
          agents under this Agreement being a claim that use of any Finished
          Products has caused death or bodily injury; or

     13.4.2 as a result of a breach of warranty by Ardana under Clause 13.1.

     An Indemnified Party that intends to claim indemnification under this
     Clause 13.4 shall promptly notify Ardana of any Third Party claim in
     respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim the
     indemnifications. The Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle the
     claim prior to any such notice. Ardana may assume and control the defence
     of any such Third Party claim, provided however, that an Indemnified Party
     shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own cost and expense,
     if representation of that Indemnified Party by the counsel retained by
     Ardana

     would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
     between the Indemnified Party and any other party represented by that
     counsel in the proceedings. The Indemnified Party shall co-operate with
     Ardana and its legal representatives in the investigation of any matter
     covered by this indemnification.

          business or goodwill; or

     13.5.2 an indirect or consequential or punitive nature, including any
          indirect or consequential economic loss or other indirect or
          consequential loss of turnover, profits, loss of enterprise value,
          business or goodwill or otherwise.

     insurance with insurers having an AM Best rating within the top 2
     categories at the time (at the date of this Agreement known as "superior"
     or "excellent"), including, product liability, contractual liability,
     personal injury, and insurance against claims regarding the manufacture,
     delivery, storage, handling and use of Product under this Agreement, in

     activities in accordance with prudent insurance practice, but in no event
     less than the US dollar equivalent of [***] pounds sterling
     (GB(pound)[***]) per occurrence and in the aggregate per year. Columbia

     during the term of this Agreement and thereafter for so long as it
     customarily maintains insurance for itself for similar products and
     activities. Each Party shall note the interest of the other Party on such
     insurance and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to name the other
     Party as an additional insured on such insurance if this is also achievable
     by the other Party and shall provide the other Party proof of such
     insurance upon request. Each Party shall cause such insurance policies to
     provide that the other Party shall be given at least thirty (30) days
     notice of any cancellation, termination or change in such insurance.

          shall transfer to Columbia or its nominee all MAs in the Territory and
          Ardana shall not following any such termination use such MA. In the
          event that in any country of the Territory such a transfer is not
          possible, Ardana shall ensure that Columbia has the benefit of the MA
          and to this end hereby grants to Columbia irrevocable permission to
          cross refer to any such MA when filing an MA for Finished Product in
          its own name;

     16.3.4 Columbia and Ardana shall return to each other all confidential
          information supplied by one Party to the other, including all copies
          and originals thereof;

     16.3.5 At Columbia's option, (i) Ardana may have [***] from the
          Commencement Date of expiration or termination to sell all existing
          stocks of Product inventory (including, at Columbia's option, any
          Product ordered by Ardana but not yet delivered by Columbia, which
          Columbia may obligate Ardana to purchase), and/or (ii) Ardana shall
          purchase any unused Packaging and Labelling held by Columbia or its
          contract manufacturer bearing Ardana's name or trademark, and/or (iii)
          Columbia may cancel any or all outstanding Product Orders; and/or (iv)
          Columbia may repurchase all or some of the Product previously
          delivered but not sold at a price equal to the price paid by Ardana
          therefor less (a) any sums owed by Ardana to Columbia; and (b) any
          sums attributable to any damage to Finished Product.

     16.3.6 Ardana shall at Columbia's cost and expense promptly pack and ship
          to such destination as Columbia may direct all Finished Product other
          than that in relation to which Columbia exercises its option under
          Clause 16.3.5;

     16.3.7 The provisions of Clauses 13 and 14 shall continue to apply.

16.4 Upon termination of this Agreement as a result of a non-renewal notice by
     Columbia pursuant to Clause 15:

     16.4.1 the provisions of Clause 16.3.2, 16.3.3 and 16.3.4 shall apply;

     16.4.2 Columbia shall repurchase all of the Finished Product (other than
          Finished Product which has become unsaleable due to any act or
          omission of Ardana or any of its Affiliates) then owned by Ardana at a
          price equal to the price paid by Ardana therefor less (a) any sums
          owed by Ardana to Columbia; and (b) any sums attributable to any
          damage to Finished Product; and Ardana shall have no obligation to
          purchase Product ordered by Ardana but not yet delivered by Columbia;

     16.4.3 [***]

     16.4.4 the provisions of Clauses 13 and 14 shall continue to apply.

16.5 Upon termination of this Agreement by Ardana pursuant to Clause 16.1:

     16.5.1 the license granted to Ardana under Clause 2.1 shall continue;

     16.5.2 if at the date of termination any of the European Regulatory
          Applications are still being progressed Columbia shall procure that
          Columbia UK ceases such activity and shall procure that to the extent
          possible under Applicable Law Columbia UK transfers the outstanding
          European Regulatory Applications into the name of Ardana. In the event
          that in any country of the Territory such a transfer is not possible
          Columbia shall ensure that Ardana can proceed with the European
          Regulatory Applications in Ardanas own name and to this end hereby
          grants to Ardana (in so granting acting as duly authorized agent for
          Columbia UK) irrevocable permission to cross refer to the European
          Regulatory Applications in the name of Columbia UK when filing such
          European Regulatory Applications in Ardana's own name;

<PAGE>

          16.5.3 Thereafter Ardana shall have the right exercisable in its
               discretion to terminate its obligation to obtain its requirements
               of Finished Product from Columbia under Clause 2.2 and the
               corresponding manufacturing and supply provisions of this
               Agreement set out in Clauses 5, 7 and 10 on giving 30 days
               written notice to Columbia.

          16.5.4 Where Ardana terminates the manufacture and supply arrangements
               under the provisions of Clause 16.5.3 Ardana shall pay to
               Columbia a royalty equal to [***]. If Ardana exercises its rights
               under Clause 16.5.3, Columbia will at its own cost and expense
               procure that its contract manufacturer or contract manufacturers
               provide such reasonable technical and other assistance as may be
               required in order to ensure that Ardana is able to manufacture or
               have manufactured Finished Product. Ardana shall be free to
               contract for the manufacture and supply of Product and/or
               Finished Product with any contract manufacturer previously
               appointed by Columbia;

          16.5.5 Ardana shall make the payments due to Columbia under Clause
               16.5.4 at Quarterly intervals. Within 30 days of the end of each
               Quarter Ardana shall prepare a statement which shall show on a
               country by country basis in the Territory for the previous
               Quarter all monies due to Columbia. That statement shall be
               submitted to Columbia within 30 days of the end of the Quarter to
               which it relates together with remittance of the monies due. The
               following provisions shall also apply:

               16.5.5.1 Ardana shall pay the sums due to Columbia from a single
                    source in Euros. Such payments shall be made free and clear
                    of and without deduction or deferment in respect of any
                    disputes or claims whatsoever and/or as far as is legally
                    possible in respect of any taxes imposed by or under the
                    authority of any government or public authority. Any tax
                    (other than VAT) which Ardana is required to pay or withhold
                    in respect of the payments to be made to Columbia hereunder
                    shall be deducted from the amount otherwise due provided
                    that, in regard to any such deduction, Ardana shall give
                    Columbia such assistance,

                    which shall include the provision of such documentation as
                    may be required by any revenue authority and other revenue
                    services, as may reasonably be necessary to enable Columbia
                    to claim exemption therefrom or obtain a repayment thereof
                    or a reduction thereof and shall upon request provide such
                    additional documentation from time to time as is needed to
                    confirm the payment of tax. For the avoidance of doubt it is
                    declared and agreed that Ardana shall be liable to pay
                    Columbia the full amount of all sums due notwithstanding any
                    reason why monies in respect of any relevant sales cannot be
                    remitted to the country in which they are headquartered.

               16.5.5.2 Where Finished Product is sold in a currency other than
                    Euros the rate of exchange to be used for converting such
                    other currency into Euros shall be the midpoint rate at
                    which such other currency can be sold for Euros as listed in
                    the Financial Times published on the first working date
                    after the last working date for the period for which payment
                    is to be made.

          16.5.6 Ardana shall keep and shall procure that its Affiliates,
               agents, distributors and sublicensees keep true and accurate
               records and books of account containing all data necessary for
               the calculation of the amounts payable by it to Columbia pursuant
               to this Agreement, and in particular but without limitation data
               relating to the calculation of Net Sales. Those records and books
               of account shall be kept for seven (7) years following the end of
               the Year to which they relate. Upon Columbia's (the "Assessing
               Party") written request a firm of accountants appointed by
               agreement between the Parties (or, failing such agreement within
               ten (10) Business Days of the initiation of discussions between
               them on this point and at the request of either Party by the
               President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered
               Accountants of England and Wales in London) shall carry out a
               review procedure in relation to Ardana's (the "Assessed Party")
               as follows:

<PAGE>

          16.5.6.1 such firm of accountants shall be given access to and shall
               be permitted to examine and copy such books and records upon
               twenty (20) Business Days notice having been given by the
               Assessing Party and at all reasonable times on Business Days for
               the purpose of certifying to the Assessing Party that the Net
               Sales calculated by the Assessed Party its Affiliates and/or
               agents, distributors or licensees during any Year was calculated
               in accordance with Clause 1.1.28 or, if this is not their
               opinion, to indicate that this is the case and to specify in
               detail why the Net Sales figures were not so calculated. The
               Parties shall then recalculate the Net Sales in accordance with
               such detailed guidance;

          16.5.6.2 prior to any such examination taking place, such firm of
               accountants shall undertake to the Assessed Party in a deed that
               they shall keep all information and data contained in such books
               and records, strictly confidential and shall not disclose such
               information or copies of such books and records to any third
               person including the Assessing Party, but shall only use the same
               for the purpose of the calculations which they need to perform in
               order to issue the certificate to the Assessing Party which this
               Clause 16.5.6 envisages;

          16.5.6.3 any such access examination and certification shall occur no
               more frequently than once per year and will not go back over
               records more than two (2) years old unless a discrepancy is
               found;

          16.5.6.4 the Assessed Party shall make available personnel to answer
               queries on all books and records required for the purpose of that
               certification;

          16.5.6.5 the cost of the accountant shall be the responsibility of the
               Assessed Party if the Parties recalculation shows the Assessed
               Party's previous figures supplied to the Assessing Party to be

               inaccurate by more than five per cent (5%) and the responsibility
               of the Assessing Party otherwise. Within ten (10) Business Days
               following any such recalculation any monies which such
               recalculation shows as being due and owing by one Party to the
               other shall be paid by that Party.

     16.5.7 at its option, Columbia shall continue to prosecute, maintain and
          defend the Columbia Patent Rights and Trademarks as specified in
          Clause 2 or shall transfer to Ardana the files and papers necessary
          for Ardana to do so, following which Ardana shall undertake such
          prosecution, maintenance and defence using its reasonable commercial
          judgement and deduct the cost and expense thereof from the royalties
          payable by Ardana under Clause 16.5.4.

     16.5.8 the provisions of Clauses 2.3 to 2.6 inclusive, 2.8 as appropriate,
          2.9 to 2.16 inclusive, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 19 shall continue
          to apply.

17.  FORCE MAJEURE

17.1 The obligations of the either Party hereunder shall be suspended during the
     time and to the extent that such Party is prevented from complying
     therewith due to Force Majeure.

17.2 As soon as possible after being affected by a Force Majeure circumstance,
     the Party so affected shall furnish to the other Party all particulars of
     the Force Majeure and the manner in which its performance is thereby
     prevented or delayed. The Party whose obligations hereunder have been
     suspended shall promptly and diligently pursue appropriate action to enable
     it to lift the Force Majeure situation, except that a Party shall not be
     obligated to settle any strike, lockout or other labor difficulty on terms
     contrary to its wishes.

18.  RECORDS INSPECTION; RECORD RETENTION

18.1 Columbia shall ensure that its contract manufacturer retains all production
     records of the processing and manufacture of the Finished Product in
     accordance with all relevant guidelines and applicable laws in the
     Territory. Columbia will retain samples of the Product as are required in
     all countries where Regulatory Approval has been obtained. Once during each
     calendar year, Columbia shall ensure and/or Columbia

     written notice and at any reasonable time during normal business hours, can
     visit and inspect the production, testing, packing, and shipping facilities
     for the Product during normal business hours to verify compliance with this
     Agreement.

     Product.

     Any inspection shall be at the expense the Party conducting such
     inspection.

18.3 Retention of Records. All documentation, records, raw data, and specimens
     pertaining to this Agreement will be held for the length of time required
     under Applicable Law.

19.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

19.1 Independent Contractors. Ardana and Columbia are independent of each other
     and nothing contained herein shall be construed to create a joint venture,
     partnership or similar relationship. Neither Party is authorized to, nor
     shall it, incur any liability whatsoever for which the other may become
     directly, indirectly or contingently liable.

19.2 Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
     construed and interpreted in accordance with English law without regard to
     principles related to conflicts of laws. The parties expressly agree that
     the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
     Goods shall not apply to the interpretation and construction of this
     Agreement. In an effort to resolve informally and amicably any claim,
     controversy or dispute (whether such claim, sounds in contract, tort, or
     otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
     thereof (a "Dispute"), each Party shall notify the other in writing of a
     Dispute hereunder that requires resolution. Such notice shall set forth the
     nature of the Dispute, the amount, if any, involved and the remedy sought.
     Each Party shall designate a representative who shall be empowered to
     investigate, discuss and seek to settle the Dispute. If the two
     representatives are unable to settle the Dispute within thirty (30) days
     after proper notification, the Dispute shall be submitted to the Chief
     Executive Officer of each Party for consideration for an additional thirty
     (30) days. If the Dispute remains

     unresolved after said sixty (60) day period, either Party shall have a
     right to commence any action, suit or proceeding with respect to such
     Dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction. The venue for such action,
     suit or proceeding shall be in the English Courts. No provision of, or the
     exercise of any rights under, this Agreement shall limit the right of the
     parties to obtain, apply for, or resort to court ordered injunctive relief.
     Ardana and Columbia each further irrevocably consent to the service of any
     complaint, summons, notice or other process by delivery thereof to it by
     any manner in which notices may be given pursuant to this Agreement.

     19.3.2 Any notice given pursuant to this Clause shall be deemed to have
          been received:

     19.3.3 A Party may notify the other Parties to this Agreement of a change
          of its name, relevant addressee, address or facsimile number for the
          purposes of Exhibit F provided that such notification shall only be
          effective on:

     to the same assignee the Columbia Patent Rights and Trademarks and
     conversely may not assign the rights the Columbia Patent Rights and Trade
     Marks (other than to an Affiliate) without also assigning to the same
     assignee this Agreement. Ardana shall not assign this Agreement without
     also assigning to the same assignee the rights the subject of Clause 2.6
     and the MAs and conversely may not assign the rights the subject of Clause

     without the written consent of the other ("Remaining Party") such consent
     not to be unreasonably withheld, provided however that either Party may
     assign this Agreement to any Affiliate or to a corporation with which such
     Party may merge or consolidate, or to which it may transfer all or
     substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, subject to
     obtaining a direct deed of undertaking from such corporation addressed to
     the Remaining Party agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this
     Agreement.

     amended, modified, superseded or cancelled, and any other of the terms or
     conditions hereof may be modified, only by a written instrument executed by
     both parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving
     compliance. Failure of any Party at any time or times to require
     performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of
     such Party at a later time to enforce the same, and no waiver of any
     nature, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances,
     shall be deemed to be or considered as a further or continuing waiver of
     any other provision of this Agreement.

     provisions or terms contained herein shall be declared invalid, illegal or
     unenforceable in any respect, the

     validity of the remaining agreements, provisions of terms contained herein
     shall in no way be affected, prejudiced or invalidated thereby.

19.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits hereto,
     contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes any
     agreements between them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

19.8 Section Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for
     reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
     interpretation of this Agreement.

19.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but which
     together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
