Borrower is not entitled to a reduction in the amount of the Non-Usage Fee if
the Warehousing Commitment is terminated at the request of Borrower or as a

Warehousing Commitment Amount in effect immediately prior to the date of

may determine, including sale under any applicable Purchase Commitment. Borrower

of the Collateral to the extent allowed by applicable law. If notice is required
under applicable law, Lender will give Borrower not less than 10 days' notice of
any public sale or of the date after which any private sale may be held.
Borrower agrees that 10 days' notice is reasonable notice. Lender may, without
notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale one or more times by
announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and the sale may be held
at any time or place announced at the adjournment. In the case of a sale of all
or any portion of the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the

Lender arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may
have been sold at a private sale was less than the price that Lender might have
obtained at a public sale, or was less than the aggregate amount of the
outstanding Warehousing Advances, accrued and unpaid interest on those
Warehousing Advances, and unpaid fees, even if Lender accepts the first offer
received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree. Borrower
agrees that any sale of Collateral under the terms of a Purchase Commitment, or

a commercially reasonable manner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="ln10_2_e"></A>&#9;Borrower acknowledges that

require Lender to (1)&nbsp;proceed against any Person, (2)&nbsp;proceed against

Collateral in any particular order, or (3)&nbsp;pursue any other remedy within
its power. Lender is not required to take any action to preserve any rights of

delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. All advances, charges,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
incurred or paid by Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by
this Agreement, or in the enforcement of this Agreement, together with interest
on those amounts at the Default Rate, from the time paid by Lender until repaid

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="ln10_2_h"></A>&#9;No failure or delay on the part of
Lender to exercise any right, power or remedy provided in this Agreement or
under any other Loan Document, at law or in equity, will operate as a waiver of
that right, power or remedy. No single or partial exercise by Lender of any
right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
at law or in equity, precludes any other or further exercise of that right,
power, or remedy by Lender, or Lender's exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower waives all defenses based on
the statute of limitations to the extent permitted by law. The remedies provided
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies provided at law or in equity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="ln10_2_i"></A>&#9;Upon the occurrence of an Event of

creating any fiduciary obligation on the part of Lender to Borrower, or as
creating any joint venture, agency, partnership or other relationship between
Lender and Borrower other than as explicitly and specifically stated in the Loan

advice of experienced counsel of its own choice in connection with the
negotiation and execution of the Loan Documents and to obtain the advice of that
counsel with respect to all matters contained in the Loan Documents, including
