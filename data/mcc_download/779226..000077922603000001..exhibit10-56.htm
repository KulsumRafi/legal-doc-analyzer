<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas, Rinaldi and Kane intend to enter into a separate document with the Company to evidence the amendments and terminations herein set forth; and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas, the Company has assumed, and is the party responsible, for all of the obligations of the Buyer under the terms of this Agreement, and all related agreements; and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement to set forth the preliminary terms of a document anticipated to be (a) an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, (b) an amendment and restatement of the Initial Agreement, and (c) a document to terminate the effect of both the Confirmation Agreement and the Amendment Agreement; and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas, this Agreement is intended to document the understandings of the parties to the matters herein set forth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For good and valuable consideration received, the parties hereto contract and agree as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The parties further acknowledge and agree that (a) the obligation of the Company to make any payments pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the condition that the Shareholder first execute (and deliver to Greenfield) a Subordination Agreement (herein referred to as the "Subordination Agreement"), in form and content acceptable to Greenfield, related to the Texcel Obligation, and (b) the term of the Subordination Agreement shall end on the earlier of the payment in full of the Greenfield Credit Facility, or the date which shall be thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by Greenfield of notice from Shareholder that the Company is in default of its obligations under this Agreement; a copy of such notice must also be sent to the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The maturity date of the Texcel Obligation is agreed to be June 30, 2004 (such date is herein referred to as the "Maturity Date"). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Interest on the unpaid portion of the Texcel Obligation will be payable by the Company to the Shareholder as follows: (a) interest on the Texcel Obligation has accrued from September 1, 2002, until December 31, 2002, at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum (herein referred to as the "2002 Interest"), (b) interest on the Texcel Obligation will accrue from January 1, 2003, at the rate of twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) per annum (herein referred to as the "Post 2002 Interest"), (c) the 2002 Interest will be payable as follows: (i) one half of the 2002 Interest shall be due on or before March 15, 2003, the balance of the 2002 Interest shall be due on or before April 15, 2003, and (d) the Post 2002 Interest will be payable as follows: (i) one half of the unpaid Post 2002 Interest from January 1, 2003 until March 15, 2003, will be due on or before March 15, 2003, (ii) the balance of the unpaid Post 2002 Interest, for the period from January 1, 2003 until April 15, 2003, will be due on or before April 15, 2003, and (iii) each payment thereafter will be due on or before the first business day of each month commencing in May, 2003, and continuing each month thereafter until the Maturity Date at which time the Post 2002 Interest will be payable in full. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Until paid in full, the principle amount of the Texcel Obligation shall be paid by the Company to the Shareholder on a monthly basis, pursuant to the formula (herein referred to as the "Greenfield Formula") as set forth in the Greenfield Credit Facility documents. For purposes hereof, the Greenfield Formula is understood to mean that (a) the Company may make payments of the principal amount of the Unpaid Purchase Amount, pursuant to the Subordination Agreement, (b) the amount of the Texcel Obligation to be paid by the Company to the Shareholder, pursuant to this Agreement, is agreed to be four and .52 percent (4.52%) of the Company's borrowing capacity in excess of $1,000,000.00 on the last business day of each month beginning with the month of January, 2003 (such amount is herein referred to as the "Availability Amount"), and (c) on or before the 5<SUP>th</SUP> day of each month, commencing with February 5, 2003, an amount which shall be equal to the Availability Amount on the last business day of the preceding month. The parties acknowledge that (i) the Availability Amount will be determined by reducing by $1,000,000.00 the amount of the accounts receivable of the Company (on the date for determining the Availability Amount each month) which are eligible for borrowing purposes by the Company (such accounts receivable are herein referred to as the "Eligible Receivables") under the terms of the Greenfield Credit Facility which are in effect at the time of making the determination of the Availability Amount for the month involved, (ii) the Company shall have the obligation of determining the Availability Amount on the last business day of each month beginning with January, 2003, until the Texcel Obligation is paid in full, (iii) the Company must provide to the Shareholder, on or before the 5<SUP>th</SUP> day of each month hereafter until the Texcel Obligation is paid in full, with a written copy of the Company's calculation of the Availability Amount for the prior month, (iv) the Company shall not take action to change the method of determining the Eligible Receivables for the primary purpose of reducing the amount to be paid to the Shareholder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (v) unless and to the extent that the Shareholder agrees to the contrary in writing, the Greenfield Formula shall remain in effect even if Greenfield ceases to be a lender to the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Greenfield Credit Facility documents, as now in effect or as hereafter amended, until such time as the Texcel Obligation is paid in full, upon the occurrence of each Significant Event (as herein defined), during the period of time from January 1, 2003 until June 30, 2004, the Company shall be obligated to make an accelerated payment to the Shareholder to reduce the unpaid amount of the Texcel Obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 6 of the Agreement. For purposes of this Section 6, a Significant Event will be an acquisition by the Company (or one of its subsidiaries) which involves cash payments by the Company (or one of its subsidiaries), prior to June 30, 2004, that exceed $100,000.00. </P>
<P>On the date of closing of each Significant Event, the Company shall be obligated to make a cash payment to the Shareholder to be applied toward the unpaid portion of the Texcel Obligation. The amount of such payment shall be determined as follows: (a) first multiply $6,252.38 (1/18<SUP>th</SUP> of the current portion of the Texcel Obligation) by the number of months subsequent to December, 2002, to and including the month in which the closing of the acquisition involved takes place, and (b) then reduce such amount by the total amount payments in reduction of the Texcel Obligation made by the Company during the period from January 1, 2003 until the date of closing of the acquisition involved. For example, if a Significant Event were closed on June 30, 2003, and no payments in reduction of the Texcel Obligations had been made prior to such date, the Company would be required to make a $37,514.28 payment to the Shareholder in reduction of the Texcel Obligation. </P>
<P>A separate calculation, as aforesaid, will be made for each Significant Event occurring subsequent to January 1, 2003. The maximum amount payable to the Shareholder pursuant to this Section 6 of the Agreement shall be the total unpaid amount of the Texcel Obligation. </P>
<P>The foregoing accelerated payments of the Texcel Obligation shall not change the obligation of the Company to make payments to the Shareholder pursuant to the Greenfield Formula. </P>
<P>7. The Company shall be deemed to be in default, and the Texcel Obligation shall become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events: </P>
