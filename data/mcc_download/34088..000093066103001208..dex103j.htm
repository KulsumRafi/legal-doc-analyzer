taxes and contributions (collectively, &#147;required taxes&#148;). Withheld shares may be retained by the Corporation or sold on behalf of Grantee. If the Corporation does not withhold shares to satisfy required taxes, in the alternative the
Corporation may require Grantee and Grantee will deposit with the Corporation cash in an amount determined by the Corporation to be necessary to satisfy required taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation will be
under no obligation to issue or deliver shares to Grantee if Grantee fails timely to deposit such amount with the Corporation. The Corporation in its sole discretion may also withhold any required taxes from dividends paid on the restricted stock.

shares issued in certificated form may bear an appropriate legend noting the restrictions, risk of forfeiture, and requirements regarding withholding taxes. If and when the applicable restricted period expires with respect to any issued shares,
subject to paragraph 7 the Corporation will deliver those shares promptly after such expiration to or for the account of Grantee free of restriction, either in certificated form or by book-entry transfer in accordance with the procedures of the
administrative authority in effect at the time. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">9.
