         The purpose of this letter is to give you the general guidelines of an

4)       The 2002 Annual Incentive Plan will provide between $50,000 and
         $200,000 (payable by March 1, 2003) based upon the degree of
         achievement of the following events:

                  -        A smooth startup transition

                             -  Including company-owned retail ramp up

         The 2003 Annual Incentive Plan will provide payout of between 40% and
150% of your base salary based upon parameters determined by December 28, 2002.

5)       The equity program will be formalized in a separate non-qualified stock
         option agreement to cover a total of 100,000 shares of Champion
         Enterprises' stock vesting over the next four years. The general terms
         of the equity program will be as follows:

                  a)       20,000 shares at 40% of market price on the date of
                           grant to be purchased within 60 days of grant. These
                           shares will vest at a rate of 25% each six months. If
                           you leave the company during the two year period, you

                           will have tax consequences of the differential
                           between purchase and market

                           price. Once you exercise this portion, you will be

8)       You will be an "at will" employee which means your employment may be
         terminated at any time, by you or Champion, for any reason, with or
         without cause and without any further obligation.

9)       During the first 18 months of employment, if the company separates you

date we close on the financing and warehouse line. For days worked prior to that
