Provider hereby represents and warrants to the LLC as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Service
Provider has been furnished prior to the date hereof a copy of the LLC Agreement or a photocopy counterpart thereof, (ii)&nbsp;the LLC has made
available to the Service Provider the opportunity to ask questions of, receive answers and to obtain any additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of the information set forth in the LLC
Agreement and all attachments and amendments thereto, and Service Provider has received all such requested information from the LLC concerning the terms and conditions of the LLC Agreement, and
(iii)&nbsp;Service Provider has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of owning the Interest. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider has received no representations or warranties from LLC, any member of the LLC or their employees or agents, or any other person and, in accepting the
Interest, Service Provider is relying solely on the information contained in the LLC Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider recognizes that the potential reward from owning the Interest is speculative and that any obtaining of money pursuant to the Interest involves a high
degree of uncertainty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider has adequate net worth and means of providing for his current needs and possible personal contingencies, and has no need, and anticipates no need in the
foreseeable future, to sell the Interest which he hereby acquires. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider acknowledges that it has been advised that the interests in the LLC have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any
state securities law or regulation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Interest which Service Provider hereby accepts will be acquired for his own account for investment and not for the benefit of any other person or with a view toward
resale or redistribution, and Service Provider does not now have any reason to anticipate any change in his circumstances or other particular occasion or event which would cause him to sell his
Interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider acknowledges that there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Interest. Since the Interest is not, will not be, and Service
Provider has no right to require that it be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other applicable state securities laws, the Interest may not be, and Service Provider
agrees that it shall not be, sold unless such sale is exempt from such registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any other applicable state securities laws or regulations and
unless the other requirements set forth in the LLC Agreement are met, and the Service Provider recognizes that the Interest must otherwise be held indefinitely and the Service Provider must continue
to bear the economic risk of the investment in the Interest. Service Provider further acknowledges that the LLC is under no obligation to aid him or her in obtaining any exemption from any
registration requirements and that the Interest is completely non-transferable. The </FONT></P>

Service Provider acknowledges that there is not an existing public or other market for the Interest and there can be no assurance that he will be able to sell or dispose of his Interest, even if the
transfer of such interest is otherwise allowed pursuant to this Agreement or the LLC Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that Service Provider resides in a jurisdiction which requires any legend to be placed on the LLC Agreement in addition to the legend existing thereon,
Service Provider consents to the placement of such legend on such document. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Service Provider is competent to and has sufficient capacity to enter into and perform his obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Service Provider. Assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by the other parties thereto, this Agreement is enforceable against the Service Provider in accordance with its
terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider understands the meaning and legal consequences of the representations and warranties of Service Provider contained in this </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;4</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Service Provider further understands that the LLC and
its respective members, principals and officers will rely upon such
representations and warranties in connection with their execution and performance of this Agreement. In this connection,
Service Provider hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the LLC and their respective principals, officers, affiliates, employees and agents harmless from and against all losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities resulting or arising from the inaccuracy, the incompleteness or a breach by Service Provider of any such representation or warranty. All representations and warranties of Service
Provider contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

Provider acknowledges that he will not be deemed to have made any capital contributions to the LLC by virtue of his services to the LLC. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service
Provider acknowledges that, as an entity formed (for federal income tax purposes) as a partnership, the LLC will not pay federal income taxes, but each member
(including Service Provider) of the LLC will be required to report his share (whether or not distributed) of the income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the character specified in
Section&nbsp;702 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Code</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Service Provider acknowledges that he understands that the LLC may not be
able to distribute cash to provide for such taxes. Thus, it is possible that Service Provider as a member of the LLC could incur income tax liabilities attributable to the LLC without receiving from
the LLC sufficient cash distributions with which to pay such tax liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, Service Provider acknowledges that certain states in which the LLC may own property will impose an
income tax on that portion of an individual member's distributive share of LLC net income, as adjusted, attributable to that state in excess of certain allowable pro-rated deductions
and/or personal exemptions (or credits). Service Provider acknowledges that both the substantive features of state and local taxes, income taxes and the filing requirements will vary and that the LLC
may also be required to withhold state taxes from distributions to Service Provider in some instances. </FONT></P>
