(the &#147;Indemnitor&#148;) in writing of such Claims which the Indemnitee has
determined has given or could give rise to a claim under Section&nbsp;7.1 or 7.2
hereof (such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a &#147;Notice of
Claim&#148;); provided, however, that failure of an Indemnitee timely to give a
Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor shall not release the Indemnitor from its
indemnity obligations set forth in this Article&nbsp;VII except to the extent that
such failure adversely affects the ability of the Indemnitor to defend such
Claim or materially increases the amount of indemnification which the
Indemnitor is obligated to pay hereunder, in which event the amount of
indemnification which the Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive shall be
reduced to an amount which the Indemnitee would have been entitled to receive
had such Notice of Claim been timely given. A Notice of Claim shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and estimated amount of any such Claim giving rise
to a right of indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have 30 business days
after receipt of a Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnitee whether or not it
disputes its liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such Notice of Claim
and setting forth the basis for such objection. If the Indemnitor fails to
respond to the Indemnitee within such thirty business day period, the
Indemnitor shall be deemed to have acknowledged its responsibility for such
Claim. The Indemnitor shall pay and discharge any such Claim which is not
contested within sixty days after its receipt of a Notice of Claim.

affects the ability of the Indemnitor to defend such Claim or materially
increases the amount of indemnification which the Indemnitor is obligated to
pay hereunder, in which event the amount of indemnification which the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive shall be reduced to an amount which the
Indemnitee would have been entitled to receive had such Notice of Claim been
timely given. Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any third-party claim
in excess of $5,000 prior to giving a Notice of Claim to Indemnitor. In
addition, if an Indemnitee settles or compromises any third-party claims prior
to or within 30 business days after giving a Notice of Claim to an Indemnitor,
the Indemnitor shall be released from its indemnity obligations to the extent
that such settlement or compromise was not made in good faith and was not
commercially reasonable. Within thirty days after receipt of such Notice of
Claim (or sooner if the nature of such third-party claim so requires) the
Indemnitor may (i)&nbsp;by giving written notice thereof to the Indemnitee,
acknowledge liability for, and at its option elect to assume, the defense of
such third-party claim at its sole cost and expense, or (ii)&nbsp;object to the
claim of indemnification set forth in the Notice of Claim delivered by the
Indemnitee; provided that if the Indemnitor does not within the same thirty day
period give the Indemnitee written notice either objecting to such claim and
setting forth the grounds therefor or electing to assume the defense, the
Indemnitor shall be deemed to have acknowledged its responsibility to accept
the defense and its ultimate liability, if any, for such third-party claim.
Any contest of a third-party claim as to which the Indemnitor has elected to
assume the defense shall be conducted by attorneys employed by the Indemnitor
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided that the Indemnitee
shall have the right to participate in such proceedings and to be represented
by attorneys of its own choosing at the Indemnitee&#146;s sole cost and expense. If
the Indemnitor assumes the defense of a third-party claim, the Indemnitor may
settle or compromise the third-party claim without the prior written consent of
Indemnitee; provided that the Indemnitor may not agree to any such settlement
pursuant to which any such remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for
which the Indemnitor shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the Indemnitee,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of a
third-party claim for which it has acknowledged liability for indemnification
under Section&nbsp;7.1 or 7.2, the Indemnitee may require the Indemnitor to
reimburse it on a current basis for its reasonable expenses of investigation,
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
defending against such third-party claim and the Indemnitor shall be bound by
the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnitee, provided that the
Indemnitor shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnitor shall pay to
the Indemnitee in cash the amount for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be
indemnified (if any) within fifteen days after the final resolution of such
third-party claim (whether by settlement, a final non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise) or, in the case of any
third-party claim as to which the Indemnitor has not acknowledged liability,
within fifteen days after such Indemnitor&#146;s objection has been resolved by
settlement, compromise or judicial decision. The Indemnitee shall make
available to the Indemnitor or its representatives all records and other
materials reasonably required for use in contesting any third-party claim and
shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor in the defense of all such claims.
If the Indemnitor does not so elect to defend any such third-party claims, the
Indemnitee shall have no obligation to do so.

representations and warranties made by either party in Articles II and III of
this Agreement, as well as the covenant of Section&nbsp;7.1(c), shall survive for
the lesser of a period of 12&nbsp;months following the date of any change in
control, or 24&nbsp;months from the Closing Date, and thereafter to the extent a
claim is made with respect to any breach of such representation or warranty,
prior to the expiration of such period. For the purpose of this provision, a
change of control will occur if the Purchaser owns less than 50% of the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company. No party shall be entitled to
indemnification for breach of any representation and warranty set forth in
Articles II or III of this Agreement unless a Notice of Claim of such breach
has been given to the breaching party or parties within the period of survival
of such representation and warranty as set forth herein.

relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to and determined by final and
binding arbitration. Arbitration proceedings may be initiated by any party to
this Agreement upon notice to the other party and to the American Arbitration
Association, and shall be conducted by three arbitrators under the rules of the
American Arbitration Association in Minneapolis, Minnesota; provided, however,
that the parties may agree following the giving of such notice to have the
arbitration proceedings conducted with a single arbitrator. The notice must
specify in general the issues to be resolved in any such arbitration
proceeding. The arbitrators shall be selected by agreement of the parties to
the arbitration proceeding from a list of five or more arbitrators proposed to
the parties by the American Arbitration Association or may be persons not on
such list as agreed to by the parties to such arbitration. If the parties to
the arbitration proceeding fail to agree on one or more of the persons to serve
as arbitrators within fifteen days after delivery to each party hereto of the
list as proposed by the American Arbitration Association, then at the request
of any party to such proceeding, such arbitrators shall be selected at the
discretion of the American Arbitration Association. Where the arbitrators
shall determine that an arbitration proceeding was commenced by a party
frivolously or without a basis or primarily for the purpose of harassment of
delay, the arbitrators may assess such party the cost of such proceedings
including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees of any other party. In all other cases,
each party to the arbitration proceeding shall bear its own costs and its
pro-rata share of the fees and expenses charged by the arbitrators and the
American Arbitration Association in connection with any arbitration proceeding.
Any award or equitable relief granted by the arbitrators may be enforced in
accordance with the provisions of Minnesota law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein will prevent a party from seeking and obtaining
equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending a final
decision of the arbitrators and the proper filing of such decision with such
court.
