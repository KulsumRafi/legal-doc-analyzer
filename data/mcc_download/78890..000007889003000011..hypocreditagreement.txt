1.02     ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.
         ---------------------

     (a) Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, all accounting terms not
expressly  defined  herein shall be construed,  and all  financial  computations
required  under  this  Agreement   shall  be  made,  in  accordance  with  GAAP,
consistently  applied.  All  calculations  made for the purposes of  determining
compliance  with this Agreement  shall (except as otherwise  expressly  provided
herein) be made by  application of GAAP applied on a basis  consistent  with the
most recent  annual or  quarterly  financial  statements  delivered  pursuant to
Section  7.04  (or,  prior to the  delivery  of the first  financial  statements
pursuant  to  Section  7.04,   consistent  with  the  annual  audited  financial
statements referenced in Section 6.07); provided,  however, if (a) the Guarantor
shall  object  to  determining  such  compliance  on such  basis  at the time of
delivery  of such  financial  statements  due to any change in GAAP or the rules
promulgated  with  respect  thereto  or (b) the Bank  shall so object in writing
within  60  days  after  delivery  of  such  financial  statements,   then  such
calculations  shall be made on a basis consistent with the most recent financial
statements  delivered by the Guarantor to the Bank as to which no such objection
shall  have been  made.

     (b) References  herein to "fiscal year" and "fiscal  quarter" refer to such
fiscal periods of the Guarantor.

                                    ARTICLE II
                                      LOANS

2.01 AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF COMMITMENT. The Bank agrees to make available to the
Borrowers (upon the request of BAX, in the case of the BAX Covered Subsidiaries,
or Brink's, in the case of the Brink's Covered Subsidiaries), from the Effective
Date until the Maturity Date or such earlier date on which the Bank terminates
the Commitment pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or BAX and Brink's terminate the
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or such later date to which the Bank
agrees to extend the Commitment pursuant to Section 2.12 (the "Termination
Date"), committed funds in an aggregate amount of $35,000,000 (subject to
reduction pursuant to Section 2.04(a)), on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, as follows:

     (a) The  Commitment  may be drawn  upon  for  Loans or  Letters  of  Credit
(collectively,  "Advances") in Approved Currencies from the Effective Date until
the Termination Date in an aggregate  principal amount not to exceed $35,000,000
(subject  to  reduction  pursuant to Section  2.04(a)) at any time  outstanding;
provided  that:  (1) the aggregate  principal  amount of all  outstanding  Loans
(after giving effect to any amount  requested)  shall not exceed the  Commitment
minus the sum of all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.
<PAGE>

     (b)  Commitment  Unavailable  to Certain  Borrowers;  Acceleration  of such
Borrowers'  Advances.  If at any time while the Commitment is outstanding BAX or
Brink's ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Guarantor,  any BAX Covered  Subsidiary
ceases to be a Subsidiary of BAX or any Brink's Covered  Subsidiary ceases to be
a Subsidiary of Brink's (each such Borrower a "Minority Owned  Borrower"),  then
and in each such event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (i) such
Borrower shall  immediately,  and without  further act of the Bank,  cease to be
permitted to draw upon the Commitment for any Advance, (ii) the unpaid principal
amount of all  outstanding  Loans  and  Reimbursement  Obligations  owed by such
Borrower, together with all interest and other amounts due the Bank with respect
thereto,  shall automatically  become due and payable without further act of the
Bank,  (iii) such Borrower  shall pay to the Bank an amount equal to the maximum
amount then  available to be drawn under all Letters of Credit then  outstanding
for the  account of such  Borrower,  for  deposit in a cash  collateral  account
maintained  by the Bank,  as security for such Letters of Credit,  and (iv) upon
the Bank's receipt of full payment of the amounts  contemplated  by clauses (ii)
and (iii),  such Borrower  shall cease to be a Borrower  hereunder or a party to
this Agreement.

(c)      Documentation for Loans. Each Loan may be evidenced by (a) one or more
         master promissory notes in form and substance acceptable to the
         relevant Lending Office (each a "Note") or (b) by loan accounts
         maintained by such Lending Office. The records attached as grids to the
         Notes and the loan account and account records shall be conclusive
         evidence, absent manifest error, of the amount of the Loans and the
         interest and payments thereon. Any failure to record or any error in
         doing so shall not, however, increase, limit or otherwise affect the
         obligation hereunder of any Borrower to pay any amount owing with
         respect to the Loans.

2.02 PROCEDURE FOR INCURRING LOANS. Each Loan shall be made upon the request of
a Borrower (and, in the case of a Borrower that is a BAX Covered Subsidiary, the
request of BAX, or, in the case of a Borrower that is a Brink's Covered
Subsidiary, the request of Brink's) to the Munich Office (which request must be
received by the Munich Office not later than 11:00 a.m. (Munich time)), unless
otherwise agreed by the Munich Office and such Lending Office, (a) on the
requested borrowing date, in the case of Base Rate Loans and Optional Rate Loans
to be funded to or in jurisdictions in the Munich Office's time zone and in time
zones following the Munich Office's time zone, (b) on the Business Day prior to
the requested borrowing date, in the case of Base Rate Loans and Optional Rate
Loans to be funded to or in jurisdictions in time zones ahead of the Munich
Office's time zone, and (c) three Business Days prior to the requested borrowing
date, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans), in a written notice in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Munich Office specifying (i) the principal amount of the
Loan and whether it is to be denominated in Dollars or another Approved
Currency, (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the Loan is to be a Base Rate Loan, an Optional Rate Loan or a
LIBO Rate Loan; and (iv) if the requested Loan is a LIBO Rate Loan, the duration
of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan. If the notice of borrowing shall
fail to specify the duration of the Interest Period for any LIBO Rate Loan, such
Interest Period shall be one month. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall be in an amount of
not less than the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000. There shall be no minimum
amount for Optional Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans.

2.03    CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION ELECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUTSTANDING LOANS.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------

(a)      Any Borrower may upon irrevocable written notice to the Bank's Munich
         Office and the applicable Lending Office in accordance with Section
         2.03(b):

(i)               elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Base Rate Loan made
                  to such Borrower into a LIBO Rate Loan or Optional Rate Loan;
                  or

(ii)              elect to convert, on any Business Day, any Optional Rate Loan
                  made to such Borrower into a LIBO Rate Loan or Base Rate Loan;
                  or

(iii)             elect to convert, on the last day of any Interest Period
                  therefor, any LIBO Rate Loan made to such Borrower into a Base
                  Rate Loan or Optional Rate Loan; or

(iv)              elect, on the last day of the Interest Period with respect to
                  any LIBO Rate Loan made to such Person, to continue such Loan
                  as a LIBO Rate Loan denominated in the same currency for an
                  additional Interest Period.

(b)      Any Borrower wishing to convert or continue a Loan as described in
         Section 2.03(a) shall deliver by telex or fax, confirmed immediately in
         writing, a notice of conversion or continuation (which notice must be
         received by the Munich Office not later than 12:00 noon (Munich time),
         unless otherwise agreed by such office) (i) on the date of conversion
         of a LIBO Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan or Optional Rate Loan, (ii)
         three Business Days prior to the date of conversion of a LIBO Rate
         Loan; and (iii) three Business Days prior to the date of continuation
         of a LIBO Rate Loan, specifying:

(A)      the proposed date of conversion or continuation;

(B)      the aggregate principal amount of Loans to be converted or continued;

(C)      the nature of the proposed conversion or continuation; and

(D)                        the duration of any requested Interest Period. If the
                           notice of conversion or continuation shall fail to
                           specify the duration of the Interest Period for any
                           LIBO Rate Loan, such Interest Period shall be one
                           month.

(c)      During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, the Bank may
         demand that any or all of the then-outstanding LIBO Rate Loans be
         converted upon their expiration into Base Rate Loans. Such conversion
         shall continue to be in effect so long as such Default or Event of
         Default continues to exist.

2.04     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENT BY BAX AND BRINK'S.
         -------------------------------------------------------------

     (a) BAX and  Brink's  may,  upon not less than three  Business  Days' prior
notice to the Bank and all other  Borrowers  then party hereto (i) terminate the
Commitment upon full  prepayment of all outstanding  Advances on the termination
date, or (ii)  permanently  reduce the Commitment to an amount not less than the
greater of (A) the Dollar  Equivalent of the principal amount of all Advances to
remain outstanding on the reduction date and (B) $25,000,000.  If the Commitment
is terminated  in its entirety  under this Section  2.04(a),  the portion of the
Facility  Fee  accrued  to,  but  not  including,  the  effective  date  of such
termination  shall be payable on the effective date of such termination  without
any premium or penalty.
<PAGE>

     (b)  For the  purpose  of  ensuring  compliance  with  the  maximum  amount
available  under the  Commitment,  the Bank  shall on each  date of a  voluntary
reduction of the Commitment  under Section  2.04(a) and on the last Business Day
of each  calendar  quarter,  determine  the Dollar  Equivalent  of the principal
amount of all then-outstanding Advances.

2.05 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Subject to Section 4.04, any Borrower may, at any
time or from time to time, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the
Munich Office and the applicable Lending Office, prepay Loans made to it in
whole or in part. Such notice of prepayment shall specify the date and amount of
such prepayment and whether such prepayment is of Base Rate Loans, Optional Rate
Loans, LIBO Rate Loans or any combination thereof. No such notice shall be
revocable by any Borrower after being given. Once such notice is given by any
Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment, and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable, on the date specified
therein, together (only in the case of prepayments of LIBO Rate Loans) with
accrued interest to each such date on the amount prepaid and the amounts, if
any, required pursuant to Section 4.04.

2.06     REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL.
         ----------------------

     (a) Each Borrower shall repay on the Termination  Date the principal amount
of the Loans made to it that are then outstanding.

     (b) In the event that the Bank determines, based on its computation made in
accordance   with  Section   2.04(b),   that  the  Dollar   Equivalent   of  the
then-outstanding  Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the Commitment,
the Bank shall give notice to the  Guarantor  and the Borrowers of such fact and
of the  amount  of such  excess.  Within  30 days  after  the date on which  the
Borrowers  receive such notice,  they shall prepay Loans, or  collateralize  the
Letter of Credit  Obligations  with cash (as set forth below),  in the aggregate
amount of such excess.  Any such prepayment  shall be made together with accrued
but unpaid  interest on the  principal  amount  thereof and, in the case of LIBO
Rate Loans, any amounts required to be paid in connection  therewith pursuant to
Section 4.04. Any prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall be applied,
first, to any Base Rate Loans and Optional Rate Loans then outstanding,  second,
to  LIBO  Rate  Loans  having  Interest  Periods  ending  on the  date  of  such
prepayment,  and third,  to the extent that the  amounts  referred to in clauses
"first"  and  "second"  are not  sufficient  to satisfy  the  entire  prepayment
requirement under this Section 2.06(b) or there are no such Loans outstanding on
the date such prepayment would be required, then the remaining amount that would
be required to be prepaid  under this  Section  2.06(b)  shall be deposited in a
cash collateral  account  maintained by the Bank, to be held as security for the
Obligations hereunder pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Bank and the Borrowers, and
to be applied to the  prepayment of LIBO Rate Loans at the end of the respective
Interest Periods therefor and to the payment of Reimbursement Obligations as the
same become due.
<PAGE>

         --------

     (a)  Subject  to  Section  2.07(c),  each  Loan  funded  by the Bank or any
Affiliate shall bear interest on the outstanding  principal  amount thereof from
the date when made  until it becomes  due at a rate per annum  equal to the LIBO
Rate, the Optional Rate or the Base Rate, as selected  pursuant to Section 2.02,
plus the Applicable Percentage for Loans.

     (b)  Interest  on each Loan shall be  payable  in arrears on each  Interest
Payment Date.  Interest  shall also be payable on the date of any  prepayment of
LIBO Rate  Loans  pursuant  to  Section  2.05 for the  portion  of such Loans so
prepaid  and upon  payment  (including  prepayment)  in full of LIBO Rate Loans;
provided,  however,  that interest  payable pursuant to Section 2.07(c) shall be
payable on demand.

     (c) While there shall be any default hereunder in the payment of principal,
interest,  fees or any other amount owing hereunder or after acceleration,  each
Borrower shall pay interest  (after as well as before entry of judgment  thereon
to the extent  permitted by law) on the principal  amount of all  Obligations of
such Person that are due and unpaid, at a rate per annum determined by adding 1%
per annum to the interest rate then in effect for the  applicable  type of Loan,
and, in the case of Obligations  other than Loans,  at a rate per annum equal to
the Base Rate  plus the  Applicable  Percentage  for  Loans  plus 1%;  provided,
however,  that, with respect to any Obligation for which the payment of interest
has been  determined  by a Lending  Office to be at a rate other than LIBO Rate,
the late  payment  rate  shall be 1% per annum  over  such  rate;  and  provided
further,  that, on and after the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
any LIBO  Rate  Loan  outstanding  on the date of  occurrence  of such  Event of
Default or  acceleration,  the principal  amount of such Loan shall,  during the
continuation of such Event of Default or after acceleration,  bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the  Applicable  Percentage for Loans
plus 1%.

     (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the
Borrowers hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest
shall not be required,  for any period for which interest is computed hereunder,
to the extent (but only to the extent) that  contracting  for or receiving  such
payment by the relevant  Lending  Office would be contrary to the  provisions of
any  applicable  law limiting the highest rate of interest which may be lawfully
contracted for, charged or received by the relevant Lending Office,  and in such
event the  Borrowers  shall pay the  relevant  Lending  Office  interest  at the
highest rate permitted by applicable law.

                  payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar
                  quarter and on the date each Letter of Credit expires or is
                  fully drawn.

(ii)              In addition to the letter of credit fees due the Bank
                  hereunder, each Borrower shall pay to any Lending Office
                  issuing a Letter of Credit (other than the Munich Office or
                  the New York Office) any standard amendment, negotiation or
                  other fees as such Lending Office may request at the time such
                  Letter of Credit is issued or amended.

     (c)  Arrangement  Fee.  The  Borrowers  shall  pay to the  Bank an  initial
arrangement fee in the amount of $35,000 on the Effective Date.

2.09     COMPUTATION OF FEES AND INTEREST.
         --------------------------------

(a)      All computations of interest payable in respect of Base Rate Loans at
         all times as the Base Rate is determined by the Bank's "reference" or
         "prime" rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
         as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of
         fees and interest under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a
         360-day year and actual days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue
         during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from
         and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day
         thereof.

(b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the Bank pursuant to any
         provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the
         Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.

2.10     PAYMENTS BY THE BORROWERS.
         -------------------------

(a)      All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower on
         account of Obligations shall be made without set-off or counterclaim
         and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to
         the relevant Lending Office, in the currency in which the relevant type
         of Obligation was denominated and in immediately available funds, no
         later than 3:00 p.m. (local time) unless otherwise agreed, on the date
         specified herein. Any payment which is received by a Lending Office
         later than 3:00 p.m. (local time) shall be deemed to have been received
         on the immediately succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest
         or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b)      Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other
         than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
         Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included
         in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be, subject to
         the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein.

2.11 LENDING OFFICE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each Advance made for the account of any Borrower incorporated or otherwise
organized in the United States or any political subdivision thereof shall be
made by the Bank's New York Office, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties,
and each Advance made for the account of any Borrower incorporated or otherwise
organized in any foreign country shall be made by an Affiliate of the Bank
located in such country, if applicable, and otherwise as may be mutually agreed
upon by the Bank and such Borrower (the Bank's branch or office or such foreign
Affiliate, as the case may be, which is required to make a given Advance
hereunder is referred to as the "Lending Office" with respect to such Advance).
The Bank agrees to use its best efforts not to change the location of any
Lending Office or to transfer its interest in any Loan to an Assignee so as to
cause payments by any Borrower to be made to a Lending Office outside the
country in which such Borrower is incorporated or otherwise organized. If the
Bank intends to change the location of any such Lending Office and such change
would cause any Borrower to become liable to make payments to the Bank pursuant
to Article IV, such payments shall not be applicable unless the Bank has given
the Borrowers at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, unless the relevant
sections of Article IV provide for a different notice period.
<PAGE>

2.12 EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION DATE. BAX and Brink's, by notice to the Bank
and the other Borrowers then party hereto (an "Extension Request") at any time
not less than 90 days prior to the Termination Date then in effect, request that
such Termination Date be extended for successive one-year terms. If in its sole
discretion the Bank agrees to grant the Extension Request, the Bank shall so
notify Brink's and BAX within 30 days after the Bank's receipt of the Extension
Request, whereupon the Termination Date shall be extended for one year.

2.13 CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS JOINT AND SEVERAL. BAX shall be jointly and severally
liable with each of the BAX Covered Subsidiaries for all Obligations of such BAX
Covered Subsidiary. Brink's shall be jointly and severally liable with each of
the Brink's Covered Subsidiaries for all Obligations of such Brink's Covered
Subsidiary. Other than as set forth herein, no Borrower shall be liable for the
Obligations of any other Borrower.

ARTICLE III
                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

3.01     THE LETTERS OF CREDIT COMMITMENT.
         --------------------------------

     (a) Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or any other Approved Currency
may be issued under the  Commitment for the following  purposes:  (i) "Financial
Letters of Credit" may be issued to any Person other than an Affiliate to secure
the payment by any Person of its financial obligations, or to provide counter or
"back-up"  guarantees in support of bank guarantees,  Letters of Credit or other
credit  facilities  afforded  to  a  Borrower,  or  to  support  local  currency
borrowings outside the United States,  and (ii) "Performance  Letters of Credit"
may be issued to secure the performance by any Person of its obligations,  or to
guaranty or otherwise secure any Person's obligations relating to a bid, advance
payment or  security  deposit,  retention  release,  custom  and duty  deferment
guaranty  or bond,  warranty or  performance  bond or other  guaranty  and shall
include  Commercial  Letters of Credit.  No Lending Office shall be obligated to
issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (a) the sum
of the (i)  aggregate  amount  of Letter  of  Credit  Obligations  plus (ii) the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Loans would exceed the Commitment,  or
any Performance  Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance,  the
aggregate  Letter  of  Credit  Obligations  allocable  to the  then  outstanding
Performance  Letters of Credit  would  exceed the  Performance  Letter of Credit
Sublimit,  provided  that for  --------  purposes of  determining  the amount of
Letter of Credit  Obligations  under  Performance  Letters of Credit at any such
time,  any portion of such amount that is  denominated  in an Approved  Currency
shall be included in such amount as the Dollar Equivalent thereof at such time.

     (b) No  Lending  Office  shall be  obligated  to issue any Letter of Credit
hereunder if such issuance  would conflict with, or cause such Lending Office to
be in violation of, any  Requirements  of Law,  including any prohibition of the
Foreign Assets Control regulations of the United States Treasury Department,  or
after the Bank or any  Lending  Office  has  promptly  notified  the  applicable
Borrower that it cannot, for any reason, issue a particular Letter of Credit.
<PAGE>

3.02     TERMS OF THE LETTERS OF CREDIT.
         ------------------------------

     (a) Performance Letters of Credit issued after the Effective Date shall not
have a term exceeding one year.

     (b) No Letter of Credit may expire  (including all rights of renewal) later
than the Termination Date,  provided,  however,  that the Bank in its discretion
may elect to, and may elect to allow any other relevant Lending Office to, issue
Letters of Credit that expire after the relevant  Termination  Date,  upon terms
and  conditions  acceptable  to the Bank,  including  without  limitation,  cash
collateral provisions,  it being understood and agreed that this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect with respect to all such Letters of Credit until
they have expired and all related Letter of Credit Obligations have been paid in
full. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the applicable Borrower
will cash  collateralize  each Letter of Credit  that  remains  outstanding  and
undrawn as of the Termination Date by deposit of immediately  available funds in
an  amount  equal  to  the  undrawn  amount  of  such  Letter  of  Credit  in  a
non-interest-bearing account maintained with the Bank.

3.03     PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF THE LETTERS OF CREDIT.
         -----------------------------------------------

     (a) Each Letter of Credit to be issued  after the  Effective  Date shall be
issued upon the request of a Borrower  (and, in the case of a Borrower that is a
BAX Covered  Subsidiary,  the request of BAX, or, in the case of a Borrower that
is a Brink's Covered Subsidiary,  the request of Brink's) received by the Bank's
Munich Office and any other  relevant  Lending  Office not later than 12:00 noon
(local  time),  unless  otherwise  agreed by the Munich  Office and the relevant
Lending Office, three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance.
Upon receipt of such request,  the Bank and any other  relevant  Lending  Office
will  determine  whether or not the  issuance of such Letter of Credit  would be
permitted pursuant to Section 3.01.


     (b) Each  request  for  issuance  of a Letter  of  Credit  shall be made in
writing by fax and  confirmed  by delivery of the  original  executed  Letter of
Credit Application and Agreement,  in the Bank's standard form or a similar form
if the  relevant  Lending  Office  uses a  different  form  (each,  an "L/C
Application"),  not later than one (1) Business Day thereafter. Each request for
issuance of a Letter of Credit and each L/C  Application  shall  specify,  among
other things: (i) the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day);
(ii) the face amount of the Letter of Credit;  (iii) the date of  expiration  of
the Letter of Credit; (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary  thereof; (v)
the documents to be presented by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit in case
of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented
by the  beneficiary  in case of any drawing  thereunder;  and (vii)  whether the
Letter of Credit is a Financial Letter of Credit or a Performance
         Letter of Credit.

     (c) Any request for an amendment to any previously-issued  Letter of Credit
shall be received by the Bank and any Lending  Office which issued the Letter of
Credit not later than 12:00 noon (local time),  unless  otherwise  agreed by the
Bank and any such other Lending Office,  two (2) Business Days prior to the date
of the  proposed  amendment  in  writing by fax.  Each  written  request  for an
amendment  to a  previously-issued  Letter of Credit made by fax shall be in the
form of the relevant L/C Application signed by the relevant Borrower and, unless
otherwise  agreed by the Munich  Office and any Lending  Office which issued the
Letter of Credit in accordance with the last sentence of Section 3.02(b),  shall
not request an extension beyond the relevant  Termination Date described in said
Section. Amendments and extensions shall be at the sole discretion of the Munich
Office and any Lending Office which issued the Letter of Credit.
<PAGE>

     (d)  Notwithstanding  any provision of any L/C Application to the contrary,
in the event of any conflict  between the terms of any such L/C  Application and
the terms of this  Agreement,  the terms of this  Agreement  shall  control with
respect  to  payment  obligations,   events  of  default,   representations  and
warranties,  and  covenants,  except that such L/C  Application  may provide for
further  warranties   relating   specifically  to  the  transaction  or  affairs
underlying such Letter of Credit.

3.04 DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENTS. Each Borrower hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees to reimburse the relevant Lending Office for each payment
made by such Lending Office under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of
such Borrower. Such reimbursement shall be due and payable on the date the
relevant Lending Office makes such payment under such Letter of Credit. If such
reimbursement payment is not made when due, the amount thereof shall bear
interest from the date such reimbursement payment became due to the date the
relevant Lending Office is reimbursed therefor at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate plus 1% per annum or, with respect to any Reimbursement Obligation
denominated in a currency other than Dollars or euros, such other rate per annum
as is determined by the issuing Lending Office to be due pursuant to the
relevant L/C Related Documents, in all cases as permitted by applicable laws.
Such interest shall be payable on demand.

3.05 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligations of the Borrowers to
reimburse the relevant Lending Office for payments made by such Lending Office
under any Letter of Credit honoring a demand for payment by the beneficiary
thereunder shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances, including the following circumstances:

(a)      any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Letter of
         Credit, any L/C Application or any other agreement or instrument
         relating thereto (collectively, the "L/C Related Documents");

(b)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other
         term of, all or any of the obligations of any Borrower in respect of
         any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent
         to or departure from all or any of the L/C Related Documents;

(c)      the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any
         Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee
         of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or
         any such transferee may be acting), the Bank, any Lending Office or any
         other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
         transactions contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated
         transaction;
<PAGE>

(d)      any draft, certificate, statement or other document presented under any
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect other than if such payment resulted from the
         gross negligence or willful misconduct of the relevant Lending Office;

(e)      payment by the relevant Lending Office under any Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply
         with the terms of the Letter of Credit other than if such payment
         resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
         relevant Lending Office;

(f)      any release or  amendment or waiver of or consent to departure  from
         any  guaranty,  for all or any of the obligations of any Borrower in
         respect of any Letter of Credit; or

(g)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar
         to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might
         otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any
         Borrower or any account party other than a circumstance constituting a
         breach of this Agreement by or the gross negligence or willful
         misconduct on the part of the relevant Lending Office.

ARTICLE IV
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

4.01     TAXES.
         -----

     (a) Payments made  hereunder and under any  instrument  executed  hereunder
shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction for, any and all present
or future taxes, levies, imposts,  duties,  deductions,  withholding and similar
charges  ("Taxes")  excluding,  in the case of the Bank, each Lending Office and
each Assignee,  Taxes  (including  franchise or receipts taxes) imposed on or in
respect of its net income,  capital,  or receipts,  by the  jurisdiction (or any
political  subdivision thereof) under the laws of which the Bank or such Lending
Office or Assignee (as the case may be) (A) is organized,  (B) has its principal
place  of  business,  or (C) is,  through  an  office  or other  fixed  place of
business,  deemed to be doing business or maintaining a permanent  establishment
under  any  applicable  income  tax  treaty  (such   non-excluded   Taxes  being
"Withholding  Taxes").  If any Borrower or Guarantor shall be required by law to
deduct any Withholding  Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or
under any instrument executed hereunder, such Borrower or Guarantor:

(i)               shall pay to the Bank, Lending Office or Assignee an
                  additional amount so that the net amount received and retained
                  by the Bank, Lending Office or Assignee after taking into
                  account such Withholding Taxes (and any additional Withholding
                  Taxes payable on account of any additional payment called for
                  by this sentence) will equal the full amount which would have
                  been received and retained by the Bank, Lending Office or
                  Assignee as if no such Withholding Taxes been paid, deducted,
                  or withheld;

(ii)     shall make such deductions for Withholding Taxes; and

(iii)             shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing
                  authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
                  law.

     (b) Borrower shall  indemnify the Bank,  Lending Office or Assignee (as the
case  may be) for  (i) the  full  amount  of any  Withholding  Taxes  (including
interest  and  penalties  thereon)  that the Bank,  Lending  Office or  Assignee
becomes  liable for as a result of a Borrower's  or  Guarantor's  failure to pay
such Withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 4.01 or applicable law.
<PAGE>

     (c) Each  Borrower  will  furnish  the Bank,  Lending  Office  or  Assignee
original Withholding Tax receipts,  notarized copies of Withholding Tax receipts
or such other appropriate  documentation as will prove payment of tax in a court
of law  applying  U.S.  Federal  Rules of  Evidence  for all Taxes  paid by such
Borrower  pursuant to Section 4.01(a).  The relevant  Borrower will deliver such
receipts within a reasonable period after payment of any Withholding  Taxes, but
in no event  later than 60 days after the due date for the  related  Withholding
Tax.

     (d) If the Bank,  Lending  Office or  Assignee  is  entitled to a refund or
credit of Withholding Tax, it shall use reasonable efforts to pursue such refund
(and interest with respect  thereto),  and if it receives such refund or credit,
shall pay to the  relevant  Borrower  the  amount of the  refund or credit  (and
interest with respect thereto) actually received.

     (e) The Bank,  Lending  Office or  Assignee  shall use  reasonable  efforts
(consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the  jurisdiction  of its  relevant  Lending  Office if such change would
avoid  or  reduce  any  Withholding  Tax;   provided  that  no  such  change  of
jurisdiction  shall be made if, in the  reasonable  judgment  of the Bank,  such
Lending Office or such  Assignee,  such change would be  disadvantageous  to the
Bank, such Lending Office or such Assignee, as the case may be.

     (f) The Bank or its Affiliate,  Lending  Office or Assignee  agrees that it
will  deliver  to the  Guarantor  or the  Borrowers,  within  30 days  after the
execution of this  Agreement  (unless  theretofore  so delivered)  and as may be
reasonably  required from time to time by applicable law or  regulation,  United
States Internal  Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN and/or W-8ECI (or successor Forms)
or such other form, if any, as from time to time may permit the Guarantor or the
Borrowers to demonstrate that payments made by the Guarantor or the Borrowers to
the Bank or its  Affiliate,  Lending  Office or  Assignee  under this  Agreement
either are exempt from United States Federal Withholding Taxes or are payable at
a reduced rate (if any) specified in any applicable tax treaty or convention.
<PAGE>

4.02     ILLEGALITY.
         ----------

(a)      If the Bank shall determine that the introduction of any Requirement of
         Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation
         or administration thereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central
         bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
         for the Bank or any other relevant Lending Office to make LIBO Rate
         Loans or to issue Letters of Credit, then, on notice thereof by the
         Bank to the Borrowers, the obligation of the Bank to make LIBO Rate
         Loans or to issue Letters of Credit, as the case may be, shall be
         suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Borrowers that the
         circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

(b)      If the Bank shall determine that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBO
         Rate Loan, the affected Borrowers shall prepay in full all LIBO Rate
         Loans then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, either
         on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully
         continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans to such day, or immediately,
         if the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans,
         together with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith
         pursuant to Section 4.04.

(c)      The Bank shall immediately notify the Borrowers of any event described
         in (a) or (b) above.

4.03     INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN; ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON LIBO
RATE LOANS.


     (a) If the Bank shall determine that, due to either (i) the introduction of
any  Requirement  of Law,  or any  change  in any  Requirement  of Law or in the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  or (ii)  the  compliance  with  any
guideline  or request  from any  central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority
(whether  or not having the force of law),  there  shall be any  increase in the
cost to the Bank or any Lending Office of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining  any LIBO Rate Loans,  then the relevant  Borrowers  shall be liable
for, and shall from time to time, upon written request therefor by the Bank, pay
to the Bank additional  amounts as are sufficient to compensate the Bank or such
Lending Office for such increased costs.
     (b) If the Bank  shall have  determined  that (i) the  introduction  of any
Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation,
(iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy
Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental  Authority charged with the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof,  or (iv) compliance by the Bank (or
other relevant Lending Office) or any corporation controlling the Bank, with any
Capital  Adequacy  Regulation  affects  or would  affect  the  amount of capital
required or expected to be  maintained  by the Bank,  any Lending  Office or any
corporation  controlling the Bank and (taking into  consideration the Bank's and
such controlling corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and the
Bank's desired return on capital) and determines that the amount of such capital
is increased as a  consequence  of Advances  under this  Agreement,  then,  upon
written request of the Bank, the Borrowers shall  immediately pay to the Bank or
the  relevant  Lending  Office,  from  time to time as  specified  by the  Bank,
additional  amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank or such Lending Office for
such increase.
<PAGE>

     (c) Each  Borrower  shall  pay to the  Bank,  as long as the Bank  shall be
required  under Federal  Reserve  Board  regulations  to maintain  reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including  Eurocurrency  funds
or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional costs on
the  unpaid  principal  amount of all LIBO Rate  Loans  made by the Bank to such
Borrower equal to the actual costs of such reserves  allocated to each such Loan
by the Bank (as determined by the Bank in good faith, which  determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error), payable on each Interest Payment Date with
respect to each such Loan,  provided that such  Borrower  shall have received at
least 15 days' prior --------  written notice of such additional  costs from the
Bank.  If the Bank fails to give notice 15 days prior to the  relevant  Interest
Payment Date, such additional  interest shall accrue and be payable 15 days from
receipt of such notice.
     (d) The Bank will notify each  Borrower  of any event  occurring  after the
date hereof  which will entitle the Bank or any Lending  Office to  compensation
from such  Borrower  pursuant to this  Section  4.03 as promptly as  practicable
after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such  compensation,
and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the
need for,  or reduce the  amount of,  such  compensation.  If the Bank  requests
compensation  under this Section 4.03, the relevant  Borrowers may, by notice to
the Bank,  require  that:  (x) the Bank  furnish  to the  relevant  Borrowers  a
statement  setting  forth the basis for  requesting  such  compensation  and the
method  for  determining  the  amount  thereof or (y) the Loans of the type with
respect to which such  compensation  is requested be either prepaid or converted
into another type.

     4.04 FUNDING LOSSES. Each Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank and to hold
the Bank and any relevant Lending Office harmless from any loss or expense which
the Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of:

(a)      the failure by such Borrower to make any payment or prepayment of
         principal of any LIBO Rate Loan when due (including payments made after
         any acceleration thereof);

(b)      the failure by such Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan
         after such Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a notice of
         borrowing or a notice of conversion or continuation;

(c)      the failure by such Borrower to make any  prepayment  after such
         Borrower has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.05;


(d)      the  prepayment  of a LIBO  Rate  Loan on a day  which  is not the last
         day of the  Interest  Period  with respect thereto; or

(e)      the conversion pursuant to Section 2.03 of any LIBO Rate Loan to a Base
         Rate Loan or Optional Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of
         the Interest Period with respect to the LIBO Rate Loan;
<PAGE>

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by any Lending Office to maintain its LIBO Rate Loans
hereunder or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds
were obtained.

4.05 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Bank shall have determined that for
any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO
Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a LIBO Rate Loan or that
the LIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect thereto does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Bank or any relevant Lending
Office of funding such Loan, the Bank will forthwith give notice of such
determination to the relevant Borrowers. Thereafter, the obligation of the Bank
or any relevant Lending Office to make or continue LIBO Rate Loans or to convert
Base Rate Loans or Optional Rate Loans to LIBO Rate Loans hereunder, as the case
may be, shall be suspended until the Bank revokes such notice in writing. Upon
receipt of such notice, the relevant Borrower may revoke any notice of borrowing
or notice of conversion or continuation then submitted by it. If the relevant
Borrower does not revoke such notice with respect to a LIBO Rate Loan, the Bank
shall make, convert or continue the Loan, as proposed by such Borrower, in the
amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by such Borrower, but such
Loan shall be made, converted or continued as a Base Rate Loan instead of a LIBO
Rate Loan.

4.06 CERTIFICATE OF THE BANK. If claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant
to this Article IV, the Bank shall deliver to each relevant Borrower a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the Bank or
any relevant Lending Office hereunder, and such certificate shall be conclusive
and binding on each recipient Borrower in the absence of manifest error.

     4.07  SURVIVAL.  The  agreements  and  obligations of the Borrowers in this
Article IV shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

this Agreement after the Effective Date is subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions precedent before the effectiveness of each such Covered

(a)      Election to Participate. The Bank shall have received an Election to
         Participate from the Covered Subsidiary, duly executed by such Covered
         Subsidiary, BAX (in the case of a BAX Covered Subsidiary) or Brink's
         (in the case of a Brink's Covered Subsidiary) and the Guarantor, in the
         form of Exhibit A hereto (in the case of a BAX Covered Subsidiary) or
         Exhibit B hereto (in the case of a Brink's Covered Subsidiary);

Borrower under this Agreement  notwithstanding its failure to meet the condition
set forth in Section 5.03(b);  provided,  however,  that such Covered Subsidiary
must  subsequently  satisfy  the  requirements  of Section  5.03(b).  If (1) the

Agreement,  and (2) the Bank shall have given the  Guarantor  and either BAX (in

nevertheless  continue and (3) the proposed Covered Subsidiary together with BAX
or  Brink's,  as the case may be,  shall  not  have  notified  the Bank of their
respective  decisions that such Subsidiary shall not become a Covered Subsidiary
hereunder,  then all amounts owed to the Bank by the proposed Covered Subsidiary
hereunder,  under any promissory  note or any other loan document  shall, at the
option of the Bank and upon  written  notice from the Bank to BAX or Brink's (as
the case may be) and to the Guarantor,  become  immediately  due and payable and
such proposed Covered  Subsidiary  shall not thereafter be a Covered  Subsidiary
hereunder,  unless  and  until  such  proposed  covered  Subsidiary  shall  have
satisfied fully the requirements of this Section 5.03.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Borrower, and, to the extent set forth below, the Guarantor,
represents and warrants to the Bank, for its benefit and for the benefit of all
Lending Offices, as follows:

6.01 CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Such Borrower is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and (i) has
the requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted and (ii) is qualified to do business in every
jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure so
to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Such Borrower has the
corporate power to execute and deliver and to perform its obligations under the
Loan Documents to which it is party and to borrow hereunder.

6.02 NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and performance by such Borrower
of the Loan Documents to which it is party have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and do not and will not (i) require any consent or
approval of the shareholders of the Borrower, (ii) violate any provision of any
law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of
the Federal Reserve Board), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination, or award presently in effect having applicability to the Borrower
or of the charter or by-laws of the Borrower, (iii) result in a material breach
of or constitute a material default under any indenture or loan or credit
agreement or any other agreement, lease, or instrument to which such Borrower is
a party or by which it or its properties may be bound or affected, or (iv)
result in the creation of an Encumbrance of any nature upon or with respect to
any of the properties now owned or hereafter acquired by such Borrower; and such
Borrower is not in default under any such order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination, or award or any such indenture, agreement, lease, or
instrument or in default under any such law, rule, or regulation, which default
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.03 NO CONSENT. No authorization, consent, approval, license, exemption of, or
filing or registration with, or any other action in respect of any Governmental
Authority is or will be necessary for the valid execution, delivery or
performance by such Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is party.

6.04 BINDING OBLIGATIONS. Each of the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is
party constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of such Borrower
enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles relating to enforceability.

6.05 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Such Borrower has good and marketable title to all of
the material assets and properties purported to be owned by it, free and clear
of all liens except those liens permitted by the Guarantor Credit Agreement.

6.06 SUBSIDIARIES. Each BAX Covered Subsidiary is a Subsidiary of BAX, each
Brink's Covered Subsidiary is a Subsidiary of Brink's, and all of such Covered
Subsidiaries' shares which are owned, directly or indirectly, by BAX or Brink's
have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable
and are free and clear of any Encumbrance. The Guarantor represents and warrants
that Pittston Minerals Group Inc., a Virginia corporation, and its Subsidiaries,
Pittston Coal Company, a Virginia corporation, and Pittston Mineral Ventures
Company, a Delaware corporation, and their respective Subsidiaries, are not
direct or indirect Subsidiaries of BAX or Brink's and may not at any time become
Covered Subsidiaries.
<PAGE>

6.07     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants
that:


     (a) The consolidated balance sheet of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as
at December 31, 2001,  and the related  consolidated  statements of  operations,
shareholders'  equity and cash flows for the year then ended,  certified by KPMG
LLP,  independent public  accountants,  copies of which will be delivered to the
Bank on or prior to the Effective Date,  fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial condition of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as at
such date and the  consolidated  results of their  operations  for the year then
ended, all prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

     (b) The  unaudited  consolidated  balance  sheet of the  Guarantor  and its
Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2002, the related unaudited  consolidated  statement
of operations of the Guarantor and its  Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter year
then ended, and the related  unaudited  consolidated  statement of cash flows of
the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter then ended,  copies of
which will be delivered to the Bank on or prior to the  Effective  Date,  fairly
present in all material  respects the  consolidated  financial  condition of the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries as at such date and their consolidated results of
operations  for the quarter  then ended,  all prepared in  accordance  with GAAP
(except for the omission of notes and subject to year-end  adjustments)  applied
on a consistent  basis;  and there has been no material  adverse  change in such
condition  or  operations  since June 30,  2002 that has had a Material  Adverse
Effect.

6.08 LITIGATION. Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Bank, including
through the delivery to the Bank of copies of reports and statements filed by
the Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no actions,
suits, or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or the properties of such Borrower before any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator that would have a Material Adverse Effect,
and such Borrower is not in default (in any respect which would have a Material
Adverse Effect) with respect to any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award presently in effect and
applicable to such Borrower.

6.09 TAXES. Each Borrower and the Guarantor has filed all material tax returns
(federal, state, and local) required to be filed and paid all taxes shown
thereon to be due, including interest and penalties, or provided adequate
reserves, in accordance with GAAP, for the payment thereof.

6.10 ERISA. Each Plan has complied with and has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Code. No Plan has terminated under circumstances giving rise to liability of the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate to the PBGC under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA, which liability remains unpaid in whole or in part, and no lien under
Section 4068 of ERISA exists with respect to the assets of the Borrower or any
ERISA Affiliate. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan,
except for Reportable Events previously disclosed in writing to the Bank that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (whether
or not waived) exists with respect to any Plan, nor does any lien under Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code exist with respect to any Plan.
<PAGE>

         Neither such Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has completely or
partially withdrawn from any one or more Multiemployer Plans under circumstances
which would give rise to withdrawal liability which, in the aggregate, could
have a Material Adverse Effect and which has not been fully paid as of the date
hereof. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has received notice that
any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241
of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA), or has
terminated under Title IV of ERISA, nor, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
is any such reorganization, insolvency or termination reasonably likely to
occur, where such reorganization, insolvency or termination has resulted or can
reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the contributions required to
be made to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that would have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make
any contribution to a Multiemployer Plan which is required under ERISA or an
applicable collective bargaining agreement in an amount which is material in the
aggregate (except to the extent there is a good faith dispute as to whether any
contribution is owed, the amount owed or the existence of facts that would give
rise to a withdrawal).


6.11      NO DEFAULT. Each Borrower and the Guarantor represent and warrant that
no Default and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

6.12     FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS.
         ---------------------------

(a)      The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important
         activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

(b)      No part of the proceeds of any Advances will be used, whether directly
         or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for
         any purpose which entails a violation of, or which is inconsistent
         with, the provisions of the Regulations promulgated by the Federal
         Reserve Board, including, without limitation, Regulations T, U or X.

6.13     INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACT. None of the Borrowers nor the Guarantor is an
"investment  company"  as  defined  in, or  subject  to  regulation  under,  the
Investment Company Act of 1940.
<PAGE>

6.14 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. In the ordinary course of its business, the
Guarantor conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws and
laws relating to occupational safety and health on the business, operations and
properties of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it
identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including any capital
or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure or restoration of
properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures
required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection and
occupational health and safety standards imposed by law or as a condition of any
license, permit or contact, any related constraints on operating activities,
including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the
level of or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat and any actual
or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related
costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, each Borrower and the
Guarantor represents and warrants that applicable Environmental Laws and laws
relating to occupational health and safety do not have a Material Adverse
Effect, and it has obtained and holds all material permits, licenses and
approvals required under Environmental Laws which are necessary for the conduct
of its business and the operation of its facilities, and it has not received any
written notice of any failure to be in compliance with the terms and conditions
of such permits, licenses and approvals, which failure could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.15 PRIORITY OF DEBT. Each Borrower and the Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants that all Debt created under this Agreement for which it is or may be
liable ranks pari passu with the Debt outstanding under the Guarantor Credit
Agreement.

6.16 ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION. The financial statements
referenced in Section 6.07, the financial statements to be provided pursuant to
Section 7.04 and the written information with respect to the Guarantor and the
Borrowers contained in this Agreement, taken as a whole, do not contain any
material misstatement of fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were then made, not misleading.

ARTICLE VII
                                    COVENANTS

7.01 POST-EFFECTIVE DATE TRANSACTIONS. Within 60 days after the Effective Date
each BAX Covered Subsidiary that is a Borrower hereunder as of the Effective
Date, each Brink's Covered Subsidiary that is a Borrower hereunder as of the
Effective Date, and each other Covered Subsidiary that may be a Borrower
hereunder when such documents are delivered, shall furnish to the Bank documents
of the type listed in Sections 5.01(b) and (c) or similar constitutive
documents. Each such Brink's Covered Subsidiary is a Subsidiary of both Brink's
and the Guarantor, and Brink's and the Guarantor each represent and warrant to
the Bank that each of the Representations and Warranties contained in Article VI
which would, by their terms, apply to a Covered Subsidiary are true and correct
with respect to such Brink's Covered Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company and
the Guarantor hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Bank and hold
it harmless from any loss, cost or expense which may arise from: (i) agreeing to
the provisions of this Section 7.01 and (ii) extending credit to such Brink's
Covered Subsidiaries during such 60-day period. In addition (and without
limitation) during such 60-day period, the Guaranty shall secure the obligations
of such Brink's Covered Subsidiaries just as if the requirements of Section
5.03(b) had been fully satisfied.

7.02 AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. For the benefit of the Bank and all Lending Offices,
so long as any Advance remains outstanding hereunder or the Commitment remains
in effect, each Borrower and the Guarantor shall, unless the Bank otherwise
consents in writing:

(i)               Payment of Taxes, etc. Pay and discharge all taxes,
                  assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it
                  or upon its income or profits, or upon any properties
                  belonging to it, prior to the date on which penalties attach
                  thereto, and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become
                  a lien or charge upon any of its properties; provided,
                  however, that neither it shall not be required to pay any such
                  tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which is being
                  contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and against
                  which it is maintaining adequate reserves in accordance with
                  GAAP.

(ii)              Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain, and cause each Restricted
                  Subsidiary to maintain, insurance with responsible and
                  reputable insurance companies or associations (or, to the
                  extent consistent with prudent business practice, through its
                  own program of self-insurance) in such amounts and covering
                  such risks as is usually carried by companies engaged in
                  similar businesses and owning similar properties in the same
                  general areas in which it operates.

(iii)             Preservation of Corporate Existence, etc. Preserve and
                  maintain its corporate existence, rights, franchises and
                  privileges in the jurisdiction of its incorporation; provided,
                  however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any
                  merger or consolidation permitted by Section 7.03(ii).

(iv)              Compliance with Laws, etc. Comply with the requirements of all

                  are being contested in good faith by proper proceedings) of
                  any Governmental Authority (including Labor Laws and
                  Environmental Laws) applicable to or binding upon it or its
                  property, noncompliance with which would have a Material

an entirety to any corporation,  the successor or surviving corporation shall be
a solvent  corporation  organized under the laws of a state of the United States
of America which expressly  assumes in writing the due and punctual  payment and
performance of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Guaranty;

     (y) if any properties or assets of the Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary
would thereupon  become subject to an Encumbrance  other than those described in
Section  7.03(i)(A)  through (N),  inclusive,  the  obligations of the Guarantor
under the Guaranty  hereunder  shall have been equally and ratably  secured with

fiscal quarter of the Guarantor, to be calculated as at the end of such quarter,
to be less than 3.00:1.00.

be taken any other  action or permit to occur or exist any event or condition if
such action,  event or condition would result in this  Agreement,  the Advances,
the use of the proceeds thereof or the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby
violating or being  inconsistent  with  Regulations T, U or X promulgated by the
Federal Reserve Board, including, Section 221.3(f) of said Regulation U.

(A)                        Terminate any Plan under circumstances which would
                           reasonably result in a material liability of the
                           Guarantor, any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate to the
                           PBGC, or permit to exist the occurrence of any
                           Reportable Event or any other event or condition
                           which presents a material risk of such a termination
                           by the PBGC;

(B)                        engage, or permit any Plan to engage, in a
                           "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of
                           Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
                           that would reasonably result in material liability of
                           the Guarantor, any Borrower or any of the Guarantor's

                           collective bargaining agreement in an amount which is
                           material (except to the extent there is a good faith
                           dispute as to whether any contribution is owed, the
                           amount owed or the existence of facts that would give
                           rise to a withdrawal);

(D)                        completely or partially withdraw from a Multiemployer
                           Plan, if such complete or partial withdrawal would
                           result in any material withdrawal liability under
                           Title IV of ERISA; or
<PAGE>

(E)                        enter into any new Plan or modify any existing Plan
                           so as to increase its obligations thereunder which
                           could result in any material liability to the
                           Guarantor or any ERISA Affiliate.

                  For purposes of this Section 7.03(viii), an amount is material
                  if it would have a Material Adverse Effect, and the
                  materiality of any amount described in this Section 7.03(viii)
                  shall be determined after aggregation with all other

         involving in the aggregate a liability (not fully covered by insurance)
         as to any single or related series of transactions, incidents or
         conditions that have a reasonable likelihood of having a Material

         the Guarantor (including, without limitation, Debt incurred under the

         behalf) to cause, and such holder or holders (or trustee) do cause,
         such Debt to become due prior to its stated maturity, and the aggregate

         presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
         are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;

(c)      exercise all rights and remedies available to it under the Loan
         Documents or applicable law; and

(d)      require the Borrowers to pay to the Bank in immediately available

8.03 RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE. The rights provided for in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights,
powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under any other
instrument, document or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

9.01 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to which any Borrower or the Guarantor is
party, and no consent with respect to any departure by any Borrower or the
Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Bank, the Borrowers party thereto and the Guarantor, if party
thereto, and then such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given.

9.02     NOTICES.
         -------

     (a) All notices,  requests and other communications  provided for hereunder
shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides,
telex or fax) and mailed, sent by overnight delivery service,  telexed or faxed,
to the address or number specified for notices to the applicable party set forth
on Schedule 9.02 (or, in the case of a Covered Subsidiary, the address specified
for notices in its Election to Participate  delivered under Section 5.03(a)); or
to such other address as shall be  designated by such party in a written  notice
to the other parties.

     (b) All  such  notices,  requests  and  other  communications  shall,  when
transmitted by overnight  delivery  service,  telex or fax, be effective the day
after  delivered to the  overnight  delivery  service,  when  confirmed by telex
answerback or when  transmitted  by fax with machine  transmittal  confirmation,
respectively,  or, if  transmitted by mail,  upon delivery,  except that notices
pursuant  to Article II or Article  III shall not be  effective  until  actually

     (c) The  Borrowers  acknowledge  and agree  that the  Bank's  agreement  to
receive  notices,  requests  and other  communications  by fax is solely for the
convenience  and at the request of the Borrowers.  The Bank shall be entitled to
rely on the authority of any Person  purporting to be a Person authorized by the
applicable  Borrower to give such communications and the Bank shall not have any
liability  to any Borrower or other Person on account of any action taken or not
taken by the Bank in reliance upon such fax communication. The obligation of the
Borrowers  to repay the  Obligations  shall not be affected in any way or to any
extent by any  failure by the Bank to receive  written  confirmation  of any fax
communication  or by the  receipt  by the  Bank of a  confirmation  which  is at
variance  with  the  terms  understood  by the Bank to be  contained  in the fax
communication.

9.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise and no delay in
exercising, on the part of the Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

9.04     COSTS AND EXPENSES.  The Borrowers  shall,  whether or not the
transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be consummated:

(a)      pay or reimburse the Bank within five Business Days after demand (or on
         the Effective Date to the extent provided in Section 5.01(g)) for all
         reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with
         the delivery and administration of, and any amendment, supplement,
         waiver or modification to, this Agreement, any other Loan Document and
         any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and
         the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
         including reasonable counsel fees, incurred by the Bank with respect
         thereto; and

(b)      pay or reimburse the Bank within five Business Days after demand for
         all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
         enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
         remedies (including in connection with any "workout" or restructuring
         regarding the Obligations) under this Agreement or any other Loan
         Document, including reasonable counsel fees (including the allocated
         cost of staff counsel) incurred by the Bank.

     9.05 INDEMNITIES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be consummated:(a) The Borrowers shall pay, indemnify, and hold the
Bank  and  each of its  officers,  directors,  employees,  counsel,  agents  and
attorneys-in-fact  (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,   suits,  costs,  charges,   expenses  or  disbursements   (including
reasonable  counsel fees,  including the allocated cost of staff counsel) of any
kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery,  enforcement,
performance and administration of this Agreement and any other Loan Document, or
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and  thereby,  and with  respect to any
investigation,  litigation or proceeding related to this Agreement, the Loans or
the Letters of Credit,  or the use of the proceeds  thereof,  whether or not any
Indemnified  Person is a party  thereto (all the  foregoing,  collectively,  the
"Indemnified  Liabilities");  provided,  no Borrower  shall have any  obligation
hereunder  to any  Indemnified  Person with respect to  Indemnified  Liabilities
arising from the breach of this Agreement by or the gross  negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person.

     (b) The obligations in this Section 9.05 shall survive payment of all other
Obligations.  At the  election of the  Borrowers,  one or more  Borrowers  shall
defend  such  Indemnified  Person  using  legal  counsel  satisfactory  to  such
Indemnified  Person  in such  Person's  sole  discretion,  at the sole  cost and
expense of the  Borrowers;  provided,  further  that no Borrower  may settle any
Indemnified  Liability  without the Bank's  consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld or  delayed).  All amounts  owing under this Section 9.05
shall be paid within 30 days after demand.
<PAGE>

     (c) If any sum due from a Borrower  under this  Agreement  or another  Loan
Document  or under any order or  judgment  given or made in  relation  hereto or
thereto has to be converted  from the currency  (the "first  currency") in which
the same is payable hereunder or thereunder or under such order or judgment into
another currency (the "second currency") for the purpose of (i) making or filing
a claim or proof against such Borrower with any Governmental Authority or in any
court or  tribunal  or (ii)  enforcing  any order or  judgment  given or made in
relation  hereto,  such Borrower  shall  indemnify and hold harmless each of the
Persons to whom such sum is due from and against any loss actually suffered as a
result of any  discrepancy  between (a) the rate of exchange used to convert the
amount in question from the first currency into the second  currency and (b) the
rate or rates of  exchange  at which  such  Person,  acting  in good  faith in a
commercially  reasonable  manner,  purchased the first  currency with the second
currency  after  receipt  of a  sum  paid  to  it  in  the  second  currency  in
satisfaction,  in whole or in part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof.
The foregoing  indemnity shall constitute a separate obligation of each Borrower
distinct  from its other  obligations  hereunder and shall survive the giving or
making  of any  judgment  or  order  in  relation  to all or any of  such  other
obligations.

9.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that no Borrower nor the Guarantor may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Bank and any assignment by the Bank must be in compliance
with Section 9.07.

9.07 ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS. The Bank, with the prior written consent of
the Guarantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, may
at any time assign and delegate to one or more Persons (each an "Assignee") all,
or any ratable part of all, of the Advances, the Commitment and the other rights
and obligations of the Bank hereunder; provided, however, that no consent shall
be required for an assignment (i) to an affiliate of the Bank or any approved
Assignee or (ii) during the existence of an Event of Default under Section
8.01(a), (f) or (g); and provided further, that the Borrowers may continue to
deal solely and directly with the Bank in connection with the interest so
assigned to an Assignee until written notice of such assignment, together with
payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the
Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrowers by the Bank and the Assignee.
The Bank and any Assignee may, without the consent of the Guarantor or any Bank,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
all or a portion of the Bank's or Assignee's rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of the Commitment and the Advances owing
to it); provided that (i) the Bank's or Assignee's obligations (including,
without limitation, the Commitment) under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) the Bank or Assignee shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers and the
Guarantor shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Bank or Assignee
in connection with the Bank's or Assignee's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which the Bank or an Assignee sells such a
participation shall provide that the Bank or such Assignee shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement. Subject to the next sentence of this
Section, the Guarantor and the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits and subject to the requirements of Article IV and
Sections 9.04 and 9.05 to the same extent as if it were the Bank or an Assignee
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to this Section. No
Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Article IV or
Section 9.04 or 9.05 than the Bank or applicable Assignee would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the Guarantor specifically consents to such right.
<PAGE>

9.08 CONFIDENTIALITY. The Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions
and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public
information provided to it by the Guarantor, any Borrower or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent such information (i) was or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure
by the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Guarantor or a Borrower, provided that such source is not
bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Guarantor or such Borrower to the
knowledge of the Bank; provided further, however that the Bank may disclose such
information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any
Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection with an
examination of the Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other
court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of
any applicable Requirement of Law; and (D) to the Bank's independent auditors
and other professional advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers
and the Guarantor authorize the Bank to disclose to any Assignee, and to any
prospective Assignee, such financial and other information in the Bank's
possession concerning the Guarantor, the Borrowers or their respective
Subsidiaries which has been delivered to the Bank pursuant to this Agreement or
which has been delivered to the Bank by the Guarantor, a Borrower, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Bank's credit evaluation of
the Guarantor and the Borrowers prior to entering into, or upon review or
renewal of, this Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the
Guarantor and the Borrowers, such Assignee or prospective Assignee agrees in
writing to the Bank to keep such information confidential to the same extent
required of the Bank hereunder.

9.09 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties
to this Agreement in any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so
executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument.

9.10 SEVERABILITY. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way
affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Borrowers, the
Guarantor and the Bank, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements
