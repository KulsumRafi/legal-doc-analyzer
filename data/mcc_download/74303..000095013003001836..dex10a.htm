general purpose of the 1988 Stock Option Plan for Key Employees of Olin Corporation and Subsidiaries (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to aid in attracting, maintaining and developing a management capable of assuring the future success of Olin Corporation
(&#147;Olin&#148;) by providing to key employees of Olin and its subsidiaries additional incentive to enlarge their proprietary interest in Olin, to continue and increase their efforts on Olin&#146;s behalf and to remain in the employ of Olin or its
subsidiaries. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">2. <B>Shares Subject to the
Plan.</B> Options may be granted from time to time under the Plan in respect of an aggregate of not exceeding 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock of Olin (subject to the provisions in paragraph 15 hereof). If any option granted under the Plan shall
expire or terminate for any reason other than its surrender pursuant to paragraph 7 (including, without limitation, by reason of its surrender or cancellation, in whole or in part, or the substitution therefor of a new option) without having been
exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject thereto shall (unless the Plan shall have been terminated) again be available for other options to be granted under the Plan. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

&#147;Committee&#148;) appointed by the Board of Directors of Olin and consisting of not less than three of those members of the Board of Directors who are not eligible to participate in the Plan or who shall have advised the Board of Directors in
writing that they irrevocably waive any rights under the Plan. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"
COLOR="#000000">The Committee shall have plenary authority in its discretion, but subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to determine the purchase price of the Common Stock covered by each option, the employees to whom, and the time or times
at which, options shall be granted and the number of shares to be covered by each option; to interpret the Plan; to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it; to determine the terms and provisions (and amendments thereof) of
the respective option agreements (which need not be identical), including, if the Committee shall determine that a particular option is to conform to the requirements of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code as amended from time to time, such
terms and provisions (and amendments) as shall be requisite in the judgment of the Committee to provide therefor or to conform to any change in any law or regulation applicable thereto; and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee&#146;s determination on the foregoing matters shall be conclusive. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

shall select one of its members as its chairman and shall hold its meetings at such times and places as it shall deem advisable. A majority of its members shall constitute a quorum. All determinations of the Committee shall be made by not less than
a majority of its members. A decision or determination reduced to writing and signed by a majority of the members shall be fully as effective as if it had been made by a majority vote at a meeting duly called and held. The Committee may appoint a
secretary, shall keep minutes of its meetings and shall make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business as it shall deem advisable. The Committee may designate the Secretary of Olin or other employees of Olin to assist the Committee
in the administration of the Plan and may grant authority to such persons to execute option agreements or other documents on behalf of the Committee. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

of Olin and of its present and future subsidiary corporations (&#147;subsidiaries&#148;). A Director of Olin or of a subsidiary who is not also such an employee will not be eligible to receive an option. In determining the employees to whom options
shall be granted and the number of shares to be covered by each option, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective employees, their present and potential contributions to the success of Olin, and such
other factors as the Committee in its discretion shall deem relevant. An employee who has been granted an option under the Plan or under any prior stock option plan of Olin may be granted an additional option or options if the Committee shall so
determine. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of Olin to grant or assume options otherwise than under the Plan in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise of the business
and assets of any corporation, firm or association, including options granted to employees thereof who become employees of Olin or a subsidiary, or for other proper corporate purposes. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

written agreement in such form as the Committee shall approve. An SAR shall entitle the optionee, upon surrender of an exercisable related option or an exercisable portion thereof, to receive a payment, at the election of the Committee in cash,
shares of Common Stock of Olin (and such other shares as may be deliverable as a result of an adjustment pursuant to paragraph 15 (&#147;adjustment shares&#148;)) or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock of Olin (and adjustment shares)

the Committee, in cash, in shares of Common Stock of Olin (and adjustment shares), or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock of Olin (and adjustment shares) equivalent to the appreciated value of the shares covered by the option
surrendered for cancellation. Such appreciated value shall be the difference between the option price of such shares (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph 15) and the fair market value of such shares, as defined in paragraph 5, on the date on which the
optionee&#146;s notice of exercise is received by Olin. If all or any part of such payment shall be in shares of Common Stock of Olin (or adjustment shares), the shares shall be valued for purposes of such payment at their fair market value, as

option to Olin for cancellation as to shares covered by such intended exercise. The Committee&#146;s right of election shall expire, if not exercised, at the close of business on the fifth business day following the delivery to Olin of such notice.
