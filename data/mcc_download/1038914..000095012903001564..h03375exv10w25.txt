                             SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT

      THIS SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT is entered into this 20th day of January, 2003
by and between Global Marine Inc., a Delaware corporation, GlobalSantaFe
Corporation, a Cayman Islands corporation, (the "Company"), and W. Matt Ralls
(the "Executive").

      WHEREAS, the Executive entered into an agreement with Global Marine Inc.
dated as of August 16, 2001 (the "Agreement") and the Company has assumed the
obligations and liabilities of Global Marine Inc. under the Agreement, and is
jointly and severally liable for any and all obligations and liabilities of
Global Marine Inc. which have or may hereafter accrue thereunder;

      WHEREAS, Global Marine Inc., the Company and the Executive desire to enter
into a new supplemental agreement (the "Supplemental Agreement"), which
Supplemental Agreement shall incorporate the Agreement and will replace and
supersede only such terms, provisions, conditions or limitations of the
Agreement, if any, that conflict with the terms, provisions, conditions or
limitations of the Supplemental Agreement; and

      WHEREAS, the Company and Global Marine Inc. shall be jointly and severally
liable for any and all obligations and liabilities which have or may hereafter
accrue under this Supplemental Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, agreements and
covenants and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Supplemental
Agreement, Global Marine Inc., the Company and the Executive hereby agree as
follows:

      1. Incorporation by Reference. The Agreement is incorporated in this
Supplemental Agreement for all purposes of this Supplemental Agreement and,
unless otherwise provided in this Supplemental Agreement, the terms, provisions,
conditions and limitations of this Supplemental Agreement shall override,
replace and supersede any conflicting or inconsistent terms, provisions,
conditions and limitations of the Agreement; provided, however, that all terms,
provisions, conditions and limitations of the Agreement that are not overridden,
replaced and superseded shall be fully operative and shall apply to this
Supplemental Agreement including, without limitation, the severance benefits in
paragraph 5 of the Agreement and the tax gross up payment in paragraph 9 of the
Agreement.

      2. Definitions. For purposes of this Supplemental Agreement, capitalized
terms not otherwise defined in this Supplemental Agreement shall have the
meaning assigned to them by the Agreement as of the Commencement Date of this
Supplemental Agreement; provided, however, that, (i) the Commencement Date of
the Agreement shall remain unchanged by the Commencement Date of this
Supplemental Agreement (thereby preserving the Executive's rights under the
Agreement) and (ii) effective as of the Commencement Date of this Supplemental
Agreement, the term "Cause" shall be defined for all purposes of the Agreement
and this

<PAGE>

Supplemental Agreement as follows in subparagraph (a) below, and part (d) of the
term "Normal Retirement Benefit" as defined in the SERP (as defined in Paragraph
7 of this Supplemental Agreement) shall be revised for all purposes of the
Agreement and Paragraph 7 of this Supplemental Agreement and for all purposes of
the SERP as it pertains to the Executive, as follows in subparagraph (b) below:

            (a) Cause. "Cause" means an act or acts of willful misconduct that
      remains or remain uncorrected for 30 days following written notice by the
      Company setting forth the particulars thereof in sufficient detail to
      apprise the Executive of the objectionable conduct and demanding
      correction and that is or are reasonably determined in good faith by a
      unanimous affirmative vote of all members of the Compensation Committee of
      the Board to be demonstrably and materially harmful to the Company or any
      of its affiliates; provided, however, Cause shall not mean inadequate
      performance or incompetence and, as a result, any termination of the
      Executive's employment with the Company or any affiliate controlled by the
      Company on account of inadequate performance or incompetence shall not
      constitute termination with Cause. For purposes of the immediately
      preceding sentence, no act, nor failure to act, shall be considered
      "willful" unless the Compensation Committee of the Board determines by an
      affirmative, unanimous vote of all its members that the Executive acted,
      or failed to act, without a reasonable belief that his action or failure
      to act was in the best interest of the Company or any of its affiliates.

            (b) SERP Amendment. Part (d) of the term "Normal Retirement Benefit"
      (as defined in the SERP) is hereby amended as it pertains to the
      Executive, effective as provided above, to provide as follows:

            (d) The monthly benefit payable under any qualified or nonqualified
      defined benefit plan of the Employers (other than the SERP), assuming the
      Participant received such benefit in the form of a single life annuity,
      reduced for early retirement using the applicable early retirement
      reduction factors in effect under any such qualified or nonqualified
      defined benefit plan on the date of the computation of such benefit,
      commencing on the date benefits are paid under this Plan or Paragraph 7 of
      the Supplemental Agreement between the Company and the Participant,
      whichever occurs first.

      3. Waiver. In consideration for the benefits conferred under this
Supplemental Agreement, the Executive consents to and otherwise waives any event
occurring on or before January 20, 2003 that would constitute Good Reason under
the Agreement.

      4. Term. The term ("Term") of this Supplemental Agreement will commence on
the date first above written (the "Commencement Date") and will end when the
Executive is no longer an employee of the Company and its affiliates and has
received all severance payments and benefits to which he is entitled under the
Agreement and this Supplemental Agreement.


                                       2

      5. Annual Salary. Effective as of November 1, 2002, the Company will pay
to the Executive an annual salary ("Annual Salary") at a rate of $400,000 per
year. Commencing after January 1, 2003 the Executive's Annual Salary shall be
increased annually by a percentage and at a time generally consistent with the
percentage increases granted to the seven most highly compensated executives,
other than the Executive ("Similarly Situated Executives"), excluding salary
increases granted to any Similarly Situated Executives based on promotions,
parity adjustments or other circumstances pertaining to specific individuals
within that group. Although the Company's compliance or failure to comply with
its commitments under this Paragraph 5 of this Supplemental Agreement will be
considered in any determination of whether the Executive has Good Reason, for
the purposes of such a determination in connection with matters relating to pay
increases covered in this Paragraph 5 only, the Executive's good faith
determination of the Company's non-compliance shall not be conclusive.

      6. Bonus and Other Incentive Compensation. For each partial or complete
calendar year during which the Executive agrees to be employed, in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Supplemental Agreement, the Executive
shall be eligible to participate in the Management Annual Incentive Plan or its
equivalent and, thereunder, shall be entitled to a target bonus rate consistent
with those of similarly situated executives; provided, however, that the target
rate shall not be less than 65% of his Annual Salary. In addition, the Executive
shall also participate in all other forms of incentive compensation granted to
and on terms similar to those granted to the Similarly Situated Executives, and
in amounts or at levels generally consistent with the allocations of awards
among the Similarly Situated Executives for 2002. In determining whether the
Executive's awards in future years are generally consistent with the allocation
for 2002, awards granted to Similarly Situated Executives shall be disregarded
to the extent they are influenced by promotions, parity adjustments or other
circumstances pertaining to specific individuals within that group. Although the
Company's compliance or failure to comply with its commitments under this
Paragraph 6 of this Supplemental Agreement will be considered in any
determination of whether the Executive has Good Reason, for the purposes of such
a determination in connection with matters covered in this Paragraph 6 only, the
Executive's good faith determination of the Company's non-compliance shall not
be conclusive.

      7. Obligations of the Company Upon Termination of Executive's Employment
or Certain Amendments or Termination of the SERP. For purposes of this Paragraph
7, capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Supplemental Agreement have
the meaning assigned to them by the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan, effective July 1, 2002, and as in effect on the Commencement Date of this
Supplemental Agreement ("SERP"). If (a) the Executive's employment with the
Company (i) terminates due to death, Disability, Good Reason or the Executive's
employment is involuntarily terminated without Cause or (ii) is terminated by
the Company or by the Executive for any reason (including, but not limited to,
death, Disability, Cause or voluntary termination without Good Reason) after the
Executive attains age 58 while in the employ of the Company, or (b) there is any
termination or amendment of the SERP, or cessation of benefits thereunder, (i)
that would in any way adversely affect the benefits that the Executive has
accrued or could have accrued under the SERP if the Executive had remained in
the employ of the Company at the same rate of remuneration as in effect on the
date of such termination or amendment, or cessation of benefits, until the
Executive's Normal Retirement Date under the SERP and (ii) that the Executive
fails to consent to in writing, the Executive shall be entitled to immediate
vesting of benefits under the SERP as if the Executive had attained age


                                       3
<PAGE>

62 and at least 15 years of service thereby entitling the Executive to the
Lump-Sum Equivalent (payable within 30 days after the Executive's Date of
Termination or the date of adoption and/or approval of such termination or
amendment of the SERP, or cessation of benefits under the SERP, as applicable)
of the full, unreduced Normal Retirement Benefit as if the Executive had retired
on or after the Executive's Normal Retirement Date determined under the SERP.
For the purposes of this Paragraph 7, any Bonus taken into account for the
purpose of computing the Normal Retirement Benefit shall be the greater of the
actual Bonus received or $250,000, and the Executive's Basic Earnings under the
SERP shall in no case be assumed to be less than an annual rate of $400,000. See
Appendix A, which is incorporated herein and made part of this Supplemental
Agreement for all purposes, for examples of how the SERP benefits described in
the preceding provisions of this Paragraph 7 shall be calculated. In addition,
if the Executive is entitled to SERP benefits under this Paragraph 7, to the
extent permitted by applicable governmental laws and regulations, the Executive
or the Executive's Beneficiary, as applicable, shall be deemed to have immediate
eligibility for any and all non-pension post-retirement benefits under any and
all plans and policies of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, as
amended and in effect at the Date of Termination, regardless of whether or not
the Executive actually retires under any pension or retirement plan. Any payment
of the full amount due under this Paragraph 7 will satisfy in full the Company's
obligations to the Executive under the SERP and the Company shall thereafter
have no further obligation to the Executive under the SERP.

      8. The Company represents and warrants that it has assumed the obligations
and liabilities of Global Marine Inc. under the Agreement and hereby expressly
agrees to be jointly and severally liable with Global Marine Inc. for, any and
all obligations and liabilities that have arisen or may hereafter arise under
the Agreement and this Supplemental Agreement. Global Marine Inc. hereby
expressly agrees to be jointly and severally liable with the Company for any and
all obligations and liabilities that have arisen or may hereafter arise under
the Agreement and this Supplemental Agreement.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Supplemental Agreement
as of the date first above written.

1.    PEP lump sums are calculated using the blended 1994 Group Annuity
      Reserving Table and the 30-year Treasury rate for the month of November
      prior to the beginning of the plan year. We have assumed that the
      applicable 30-year Treasury rate is 6.00% for this calculation. The actual
      Treasury rate will be based on the rate in effect at retirement. The lump
      sum factor is applied to an annual single life annuity benefit.

2.    SERP lump sums are calculated using the blended 1994 Group Annuity
      Reserving Table and the lesser of a 5.00% interest rate or the average
      monthly Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation immediate and deferred
      interest rate for the preceding calendar quarter. We have assumed that the
      applicable interest rate is 5.00% for this calculation. The actual
      interest rate will be determined at retirement and will not exceed 5.00%.
      The lump sum factor is applied to an annual 100% joint and survivor
      annuity benefit and assumes that the participant's spouse is 10 years and
      10 months younger than the participant.
