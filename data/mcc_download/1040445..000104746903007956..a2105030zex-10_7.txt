request of AFC-II or the Administrator on behalf of AFC-II, the Series 2002-4
Invested Amount may be reduced (a "DECREASE") by the Trustee's withdrawing from
the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection Account, depositing into the Series 2002-4
Distribution Account and distributing to the Administrative Agent funds on
deposit in the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection Account on such day in accordance
with Section 3.5(b) in an amount not to exceed the amount of such funds on
deposit on such day; PROVIDED that AFC-II shall have given the Administrative
Agent (with a copy to the Trustee) irrevocable written notice (effective upon
receipt) of the amount of such Decrease prior to 9:30 a.m. (New York City time)
on the second Business Day prior to such Decrease, in the case of any such
Decrease in an amount less than $200,000,000, and prior to 9:30 a.m. (New York

in the case of any such Decrease in an amount of $200,000,000 or more; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that any such Decrease shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000 and
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, if such Decrease will be
used to reduce one or more Non-Extending Purchaser Group's Purchaser Group
Invested Amounts, such Decrease may be in such amount as is necessary to reduce
the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts of all such Non-Extending Purchaser Groups
to zero). Upon each Decrease, the Administrative Agent shall indicate in its
records such Decrease and the Purchaser Group Invested Amount outstanding with
respect to each Purchaser Group after giving effect to such Decrease. Upon
receipt of any notice required by Section 2.5(a) from AFC-II, the Administrative
Agent shall forward (by telecopy or electronic messaging system) a copy of such
notice to the Funding Agent with respect to each Purchaser Group, no later than
1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day received.

          (b)   On any Business Day, AFC-II shall have the right to deliver an
irrevocable written notice (an "OPTIONAL TERMINATION NOTICE") to the
Administrative Agent, the Trustee, the Administrator and the Rating Agencies in
which AFC-II declares that the Commitments shall terminate on the date (the
"OPTIONAL TERMINATION DATE") set forth in such notice (which date, in any event,
shall be a Distribution Date not less than twenty Business Days from the date on
which such notice is delivered). Upon receipt of any Optional Termination Notice
from AFC-II,

                                      -27-
<Page>

the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Funding Agent with respect to
each Purchaser Group thereof.

          (c)   From and after the Optional Termination Date, the Series 2002-4
Amortization Period shall commence for all purposes under this Supplement, the
Base Indenture and the Related Documents.

          (d)   If there are Principal Collections on deposit in the Series
2002-4 Excess Collection Account on any Business Day on which the Purchaser
Group Invested Amount with respect to any Non-Extending Purchaser Group shall
not have been reduced to zero and AFC-II would be permitted under the terms of
Section 2.5(a) to effect a Decrease with such funds, AFC-II shall request such a
Decrease in accordance with Section 2.5(a) on the earliest possible date.

          Section 2.6. INCREASES AND REDUCTIONS OF THE COMMITMENTS; EXTENSIONS
OF THE COMMITMENTS. (a) AFC-II may from time to time request that any Purchaser
Group agree to increase the amount set forth opposite the name of the CP Conduit
Purchaser included in such Purchaser Group on Schedule I. An increase in such
amount shall be effective hereunder if such Purchaser Group shall have agreed in
its sole discretion to such increase.

          (b)   If AFC-II desires to extend the Scheduled Expiry Date with
respect to the Purchaser Groups, AFC-II shall notify the Administrative Agent at
least 60 days prior to such Scheduled Expiry Date of its desire to extend the
Scheduled Expiry Date with respect to the Purchaser Groups, whereupon the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Funding Agent with respect to each
Purchaser Group of AFC-II's desire to so extend the Scheduled Expiry Date. Each
Funding Agent, on behalf of its Purchaser Group, shall notify the Administrative
Agent and AFC-II in writing of whether such Purchaser Group agrees to an
extension of the Scheduled Expiry Date with respect to such Purchaser Group;
PROVIDED that failure by a Funding Agent to respond to such request shall not be
construed as a consent by such Purchaser Group to such extension. The decision
to extend or not extend shall be made by each Purchaser Group in its sole
discretion and any such extension shall be subject to the Rating Agency Consent
Condition. In the event that any Purchaser Group desires to extend its Scheduled
Expiry Date for an amount that is less than its Maximum Purchaser Group Invested
Amount prior to AFC-II's request for an extension, AFC-II, in its sole
discretion, may accept such extension; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Purchaser
Group (x) shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Purchaser Group for purposes of
Section 3.5 having a Purchaser Group Invested Amount equal to the excess of its
Purchaser Group Invested Amount over a percentage of its Maximum Purchaser Group
Invested Amount that will be available after the extension of its Scheduled
Expiry Date equal to the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator of
which is the sum of the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to all
Extending Purchaser Groups, other than such Purchaser Group and any other
Purchaser Group reducing its Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amount, and the
denominator of which is the sum of the Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amounts
of all Extending Purchaser Groups, other than such Purchaser Group and any other
Purchaser Group reducing its Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amount and (y)
shall be deemed to be an Extending Purchaser Group with a Maximum Purchaser
Group Invested Amount equal to the portion of its Maximum Purchaser Group
Invested Amount that will be available after the extension of its Scheduled
Expiry Date.

          (c)   On any Business Day during the Series 2002-4 Revolving Period,
AFC-II may, upon two (2) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent (effective upon receipt) (with copies to the Administrator
and the Trustee) reduce the Series 2002-4 Maximum Invested Amount in an amount
equal to $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
PROVIDED that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after
giving effect thereto and to any reduction in the Series 2002-4 Invested Amount
on such date, (x) the Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to any
Purchaser Group would exceed the Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amount with
respect to such Purchaser Group then in effect or (y) the Series 2002-4 Invested
Amount would exceed the Series 2002-4 Maximum Invested Amount. Any reduction in
the Series 2002-4 Maximum Invested Amount shall be made on a PRO RATA basis to
the Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to the Purchaser
Groups, based on the Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to
each Purchaser Group. Once reduced, the Maximum Purchaser Group Invested Amounts
may not be subsequently reinstated without each such Purchaser Group's prior
written consent, which consent shall be granted or not in the sole discretion of
such Purchaser Group.

          (d)   If, after receiving a request for extension of its Scheduled
Expiry Date from AFC-II pursuant to Section 2.6(b), the Funding Agent with
respect to a CP Conduit Purchaser notifies AFC-II in writing of its decision not
to extend its Scheduled Expiry Date as requested or fails to respond to AFC-II's
request within 30 days of its receipt of such request, at the request of AFC-II,
such CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Banks with respect to such CP Conduit
Purchaser shall on a Distribution Date thereafter selected by AFC-II (or such
other date as may be agreed by AFC-II, the Funding Agent and the Administrative
Agent) assign all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations
under this Supplement and the Series 2002-4 Notes pursuant to Section 11.1 to a
replacement CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Banks with respect to such
replacement CP Conduit Purchaser selected by AFC-II upon payment by the
replacement CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Banks with respect to such
replacement CP Conduit Purchaser (or upon payment by AFC-II as agreed to by
AFC-II, the assignor and the assignee) of an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to such Non-Extending Purchaser
Group, PLUS (ii) (A) if such Purchaser Group includes a Match Funding CP Conduit
Purchaser, the sum of (x) all accrued and unpaid Discount on all outstanding
Commercial Paper issued by, or for the benefit of, such Match Funding CP Conduit
Purchaser to fund the CP Funded Amount with respect to such Match Funding CP
Conduit Purchaser from the issuance date(s) thereof to but excluding the date
(the "PURCHASE EFFECTIVE DATE") of the assignment to the replacement CP Conduit
Purchaser and the APA Banks with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser and (y)

Purchaser, the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid Discount on
or in respect of the Commercial Paper issued by, or for the benefit of, such
Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser allocated, in whole or in part, by the
Funding Agent with respect to such Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser, to fund
the purchase or maintenance of the CP Funded Amount with respect to such Pooled
Funding CP Conduit Purchaser as of the Purchase Effective Date and (y) the
aggregate amount of Discount to accrue on or in respect of the Commercial Paper
issued by, or for the benefit of, such Pooled

                                      -29-

Funding CP Conduit Purchaser allocated, in whole or in part, by the Funding
Agent with respect to such Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser, to fund the

elect that AFC-II no longer be permitted to select CP Tranches in accordance
with Sections 2.7(b) and (c) in respect of the CP Conduit Funded Amount with

during the period from the Series 2002-4 Closing Date to and including the
Expiry Date with respect to such Purchaser Group at the Commitment Fee Rate of

against any loss, liability, expense, damage or injury suffered or sustained by
(a "CLAIM") such Company indemnified person by reason of (i) any acts, omissions
or alleged acts or omissions arising out of, or relating to, activities of
AFC-II pursuant to the Indenture or the other Related Documents to which it is a
party, (ii) a breach of any representation or warranty made or deemed made by
AFC-II (or any of its officers) in the Indenture or other Related Document or
(iii) a failure by AFC-II to comply with any applicable law or regulation or to
perform its covenants, agreements, duties or obligations required to be
performed or observed by it in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
or the other

Related Documents, including, but not limited to, any judgment, award,
settlement, reasonable attorneys' fees and other reasonable costs or expenses
incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action,
proceeding or claim, except to the extent such loss, liability, expense, damage
or injury resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
such Company indemnified person or its officers, directors, agents, principals,
employees or employers or includes any Excluded Taxes; PROVIDED that any
payments made by AFC-II pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be made solely from
funds available pursuant to Section 3.3(e), shall be non-recourse other than
with respect to such funds, and shall not constitute a claim against AFC-II to
the extent that such funds are insufficient to make such payment.

          Section 2.9. FUNDING AGENTS. (a) The Funding Agent with respect to
each Purchaser Group is hereby authorized to record on each Business Day the CP
Funded Amount with respect to such Purchaser Group and the aggregate amount of
Discount accruing with respect thereto on such Business Day and the APA Bank
Funded Amount with respect to such Purchaser Group and the amount of interest
accruing with respect thereto on such Business Day and, based on such
recordations, to determine the Monthly Funding Costs with respect to each Series
2002-4 Interest Period and such Purchaser Group. Any such recordation by a
Funding Agent, absent manifest error, shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the accuracy of the information so recorded. Furthermore, the Funding Agent with
respect to each Purchaser Group will maintain records sufficient to identify the
percentage interest of the related CP Conduit Purchaser and each APA Bank with
respect to such Purchaser Group holding an interest in the Series 2002-4 Note
registered in the name of such Funding Agent and any amounts owing thereunder.

          (b)   Upon receipt of funds from the Administrative Agent on each
Distribution Date and the date of any Decrease, each Funding Agent shall pay
such funds to the related CP Conduit Purchaser and/or the related APA Bank owed
such funds in accordance with the recordations maintained by it in accordance
with Section 2.9(a) and the Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to such CP
Conduit Purchaser. If a Funding Agent shall have paid to any CP Conduit
Purchaser or APA Bank any funds that (i) must be returned for any reason
(including bankruptcy) or (ii) exceeds that which such CP Conduit Purchaser or
APA Bank was entitled to receive, such amount shall be promptly repaid to such
Funding Agent by such CP Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank.

          Cash Collateral Account, deposit in the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral
          Account an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of the Series
          2002-4 Past Due Rent Payment remaining after any payment pursuant to
          clauses (i) and (ii) above and (y) the amount withdrawn from the
          Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account on account of such Series 2002-4
          Lease Payment Deficit;

                (iv)    allocate to the Series 2002-4 Accrued Interest Account
          the amount, if any, by which the Series 2002-4 Lease Interest Payment
          Deficit, if any, relating to such Series 2002-4 Lease Payment Deficit
          exceeds the amount of the Series 2002-4 Past Due Rent Payment applied
          pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above; and

                (v)     treat the remaining amount of the Series 2002-4 Past Due
          Rent Payment as Principal Collections allocated to the Series 2002-4
          Notes in accordance with Section 3.2(a)(ii) or 3.2(b)(ii), as the case
          may be.

          Section 3.3. PAYMENTS TO NOTEHOLDERS. The Funding Agent with respect
to each Purchaser Group shall provide written notice to the Administrative Agent
(x) no later than two Business Days prior to each Determination Date, setting
forth the Monthly Funding Costs with respect to such Purchaser Group with
respect to the portion of the current Series 2002-4 Interest Period ending on
such Business Day and a reasonable estimation of the Monthly Funding Costs with
respect to such Purchaser Group for the remainder of such Series 2002-4 Interest
Period and (y) within three Business Days after the end of each calendar month,
setting forth the Monthly Funding Costs (calculated as if such calendar month
was a Series 2002-4 Interest Period) with respect to such Purchaser Group for
such calendar month. The Administrative Agent shall, within two Business Days
following its receipt of such information, compile the information provided in
such written notice provided pursuant to (x) or (y) above, as applicable, into
one written notice for all Purchaser Groups and forward such notice to the
Administrator. On each Determination Date, the Administrator shall determine the
Series 2002-4 Note Rate for the current Series 2002-4 Interest Period. If the
actual amount of the Monthly Funding Costs with

                                      -37-
<Page>

respect to any Purchaser Group for a Series 2002-4 Interest Period is less than
or greater than the amount thereof estimated by the Funding Agent with respect
to such Purchaser Group on a Determination Date, such Funding Agent shall notify
the Administrator and the Administrative Agent thereof on the next succeeding
Determination Date and the Administrator will reduce or increase the Monthly
Funding Costs with respect to such Purchaser Group for the next succeeding
Series 2002-4 Interest Period accordingly. The Administrator shall determine the
Series 2002-4 Note Rate for the last Series 2002-4 Interest Period on the
Determination Date immediately preceding the final Distribution Date based on
the information provided by the Funding Agents. If a Funding Agent determines
that the actual Monthly Funding Costs with respect to its Purchaser Group for
the last Series 2002-4 Interest Period will be more or less than the estimate
thereof provided to the Administrator and informs the Administrator of such
variance prior to the Distribution Date for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period,
the Administrator will recalculate the Series 2002-4 Note Rate for such Series
2002-4 Interest Period. On each Determination Date, as provided below, the
Administrator shall instruct the Paying Agent in writing pursuant to the
Administration Agreement to withdraw, and on the following Distribution Date the
Paying Agent, acting in accordance with such instructions, shall withdraw the
amounts required to be withdrawn from the Collection Account pursuant to
Sections 3.3(a) below in respect of all funds available from Interest
Collections processed since the preceding Distribution Date and allocated to the
holders of the Series 2002-4 Notes.

          (a)   NOTE INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO THE SERIES 2002-4 NOTES. On each
Determination Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Trustee and the Paying
Agent in writing pursuant to the Administration Agreement as to the amount to be
withdrawn and paid pursuant to Section 3.4 from the Series 2002-4 Accrued
Interest Account to the extent funds are anticipated to be available from
Interest Collections allocable to the Series 2002-4 Notes processed from, but
not including, the preceding Distribution Date through the succeeding
Distribution Date in respect of (x) first, an amount equal to the Series 2002-4
Monthly Interest for the Series 2002-4 Interest Period ending on the day
preceding the related Distribution Date, (y) second, an amount equal to the
Commitment Fees for each Purchaser Group for the Series 2002-4 Interest Period
ending on the day preceding the related Distribution Date and (z) third, an
amount equal to the amount of any unpaid Series 2002-4 Shortfall as of the
preceding Distribution Date (together with any accrued interest on such Series
2002-4 Shortfall). On the following Distribution Date, the Trustee shall
withdraw the amounts described in the first sentence of this Section 3.3(a) from
the Series 2002-4 Accrued Interest Account and deposit such amounts in the
Series 2002-4 Distribution Account.

          (b)   WITHDRAWALS FROM SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE ACCOUNT. If the
Administrator determines on any Distribution Date that the amounts available
from the Series 2002-4 Accrued Interest Account are insufficient to pay the sum
of the amounts described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of Section 3.3(a) above on
such Distribution Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Trustee in writing
to withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account and deposit in the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account on such Distribution Date an amount equal to the
lesser of the Series 2002-4 Available Reserve Account Amount and such
insufficiency. The Trustee shall withdraw such amount from the Series 2002-4
Reserve Account and deposit such amount in the Series 2002-4 Distribution
Account.

                                      -38-

          (c)   LEASE PAYMENT DEFICIT NOTICE. On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on each Distribution Date, the Administrator shall notify the Trustee
of the amount of any Series 2002-4 Lease Payment Deficit, such notification to
be in the form of EXHIBIT F to this Supplement (each a "LEASE PAYMENT DEFICIT
Notice").

          (d)   DRAWS ON SERIES 2002-4 LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR SERIES 2002-4
LEASE INTEREST PAYMENT DEFICITS. If the Administrator determines on any
Distribution Date that there exists a Series 2002-4 Lease Interest Payment
Deficit, the Administrator shall instruct the Trustee in writing to draw on the
Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit, if any, and, the Trustee shall, by 12:00 noon
(New York City time) on such Distribution Date draw an amount (identified by the
Administrator) equal to the least of (i) such Series 2002-4 Lease Interest
Payment Deficit, (ii) the excess, if any, of the sum of the amounts described in
clauses (x), (y) and (z) of Section 3.3(a) above on such Distribution Date over
the amounts available from the Series 2002-4 Accrued Interest Account on such
Distribution Date plus the amount withdrawn from the Series 20002-4 Reserve
Account pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and (iii) the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit
Liquidity Amount on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit by presenting to each
Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Provider a draft accompanied by a Certificate of
Lease Deficit Demand and shall cause the Lease Deficit Disbursements to be
deposited in the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account on such Distribution Date
for distribution in accordance with Section 3.4; PROVIDED, however, that if the
Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account has been established and funded, the
Trustee shall withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account and
deposit in the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account an amount equal to the lesser
of (x) the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Percentage on such Distribution Date of
the least of the amounts described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and (y)
the Series 2002-4 Available Cash Collateral Account Amount on such Distribution
Date and draw an amount equal to the remainder of such amount on the Series
2002-4 Letters of Credit.

          (e)   BALANCE. On or prior to the second Business Day preceding each
Distribution Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Trustee and the Paying
Agent in writing pursuant to the Administration Agreement to pay the balance
(after making the payments required in Section 3.3(a)), if any, of the amounts
available from the Series 2002-4 Accrued Interest Account as follows:

                (i)     on each Distribution Date during the Series 2002-4
          Revolving Period, (1) first, to the Administrator, an amount equal to
          the Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the beginning of such Series 2002-4
          Interest Period of the portion of the Monthly Administration Fee
          payable by AFC-II (as specified in clause (iii) of the definition
          thereof) for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period, (2) second, to the
          Trustee, an amount equal to the Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the
          beginning of such Series 2002-4 Interest Period of the Trustee's fees
          for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period, (3) third, to the Series
          2002-4 Distribution Account to pay any Article VII Costs, (4) fourth,
          to pay any Carrying Charges (other than Carrying Charges provided for

          to the Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the beginning of such Series
          2002-4 Interest Period of such Carrying Charges (other than Carrying
          Charges provided for above) for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period and
          (5) fifth, the balance, if any ("EXCESS COLLECTIONS"), shall be
          withdrawn by the Paying Agent

                                      -39-
<Page>

          from the Series 2002-4 Collection Account and deposited in the Series
          2002-4 Excess Collection Account; and

                (ii)    on each Distribution Date during the Series 2002-4
          Amortization Period, (1) first, to the Trustee, an amount equal to the
          Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the beginning of such Series 2002-4
          Interest Period of the Trustee's fees for such Series 2002-4 Interest
          Period, (2) second, to the Administrator, an amount equal to the
          Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the beginning of such Series 2002-4
          Interest Period of the portion of the Monthly Administration Fee (as
          specified in clause (iii) of the definition thereof) payable by AFC-II
          for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period, (3) third, to the Series
          2002-4 Distribution Account to pay any Article VII Costs, (4) fourth,
          to pay any Carrying Charges (other than Carrying Charges provided for
          above) to the Persons to whom such amounts are owed, an amount equal
          to the Series 2002-4 Percentage as of the beginning of such Series
          2002-4 Interest Period of such Carrying Charges (other than Carrying
          Charges provided for above) for such Series 2002-4 Interest Period and
          (5) fifth, the balance, if any, shall be treated as Principal
          Collections.

          (f)   SHORTFALLS. If the amounts described in Section 3.3 are
insufficient to pay the Series 2002-4 Monthly Interest and the Commitment Fees
of the Purchaser Groups on any Distribution Date, payments of interest to the
Series 2002-4 Noteholders and payments of Commitment Fees to the Purchaser
Groups will be reduced on a PRO RATA basis by the amount of such deficiency. The
aggregate amount, if any, of such deficiency on any Distribution Date shall be
referred to as the "SERIES 2002-4 SHORTFALL." Interest shall accrue on the
Series 2002-4 Shortfall at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum.

          Section 3.4. PAYMENT OF NOTE INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES. On each
Distribution Date, subject to Section 9.8 of the Base Indenture, the Paying
Agent shall, in accordance with Section 6.1 of the Base Indenture, pay to the
Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Purchaser Groups from the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account the amounts deposited in the Series 2002-4
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 3.3. Upon the receipt of funds from the
Paying Agent on each Distribution Date on account of Series 2002-4 Monthly
Interest, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Funding Agent with respect
to a Purchaser Group an amount equal to the Monthly Funding Costs with respect
to such Purchaser Group with respect to the Series 2002-4 Interest Period ending
on the day preceding such Distribution Date PLUS the amount of any unpaid Series
2002-4 Shortfalls relating to unpaid Series 2002-4 Monthly Interest payable to
such Purchaser Group as of the preceding Distribution Date, together with any
interest thereon at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum. If the amount
paid to the Administrative Agent on any Distribution Date pursuant to this
Section 3.4 on account of Series 2002-4 Monthly Interest for the Series 2002-4
Interest Period ending on the day preceding such Distribution Date is less than
such Series 2002-4 Monthly Interest, the Administrative Agent shall pay the
amount available to the Funding Agents, on behalf of the Purchaser Groups, on a
PRO RATA basis, based on the Monthly Funding Costs with respect to each
Purchaser Group with respect to such Series 2002-4 Interest Period. Upon the
receipt of funds from the Paying Agent on each Distribution Date on account of
Commitment Fees, the Administrative Agent shall pay to each Funding Agent with
respect to a Purchaser Group an amount equal to the Commitment Fee payable to
such Purchaser Group with respect to the Series 2002-4 Interest Period ending on

                                      -40-
<Page>

the day preceding such Distribution Date PLUS the amount of any unpaid Series
2002-4 Shortfalls relating to unpaid Commitment Fees payable to such Purchaser
Group as of the preceding Distribution Date, together with any interest thereon
at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum. If the amount paid to the
Administrative Agent on any Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 3.4 on
account of Commitment Fees is less than the Commitment Fees payable on such
Distribution Date, the Administrative Agent shall pay the amount available to
the Funding Agents, on behalf of the Purchaser Groups, on a PRO RATA basis,
based on the Commitment Fee payable to each Purchaser Group on such Distribution
Date. Upon the receipt of funds from the Trustee or the Paying Agent on any
Distribution Date on account of Article VII Costs, the Administrative Agent
shall pay such amounts to the Funding Agent with respect to the CP Conduit
Purchaser or the APA Bank owed such amounts. If the amounts paid to the
Administrative Agent on any Distribution Date pursuant to Section 3.3(e) on
account of Article VII Costs are less than the Article VII Costs due and payable
on such Distribution Date, the Administrative Agent shall pay the amounts
available to the Funding Agents with respect to the CP Conduit Purchasers and
APA Banks owed such amounts, on a PRO RATA basis, based on the Article VII Costs
owing to such CP Conduit Purchasers and APA Banks. Due and unpaid Article VII
Costs owing to a Purchaser Group shall accrue interest at the Alternate Base
Rate PLUS 2%; PROVIDED that Article VII Costs shall not be considered due until
the first Distribution Date following five days notice to AFC-II and the
Administrator of such Article VII Costs.

          Section 3.5. PAYMENT OF NOTE PRINCIPAL. (a) MONTHLY PAYMENTS DURING
SERIES 2002-4 AMORTIZATION PERIOD. Commencing on the first Determination Date
after the commencement of the Series 2002-4 Amortization Period, the

the Series 2002-4 Demand Notes and/or on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit (or
withdrawn from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account). On the Distribution
Date following each such Determination Date, the Trustee shall withdraw the
amount allocated to the Series 2002-4 Notes during the Related Month pursuant to
Section 3.2(b)(ii) or (c)(ii), as the case may be, from the Series 2002-4
Collection Account and deposit such amount in the Series 2002-4 Distribution
Account, to be paid to the holders of the Series 2002-4 Notes.

          (b)   DECREASES. On any Business Day during the Series 2002-Revolving
Period on which a Decrease is to be made pursuant to Section 2.5, the Trustee
shall withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection Account in accordance
with the written instructions of the Administrator an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the funds then allocated to the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection Account
and (ii) the amount of such Decrease, and deposit such amount in the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account, to be paid to the Administrative Agent for

          such Distribution Date, in the case of any other Principal Deficit
          Amount, to withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account, an amount
          equal to the lesser of (x) the Series 2002-4 Available Reserve Account
          Amount and (y) such Principal Deficit Amount and deposit it in the
          Series 2002-4 Distribution Account on such Distribution Date.

                (ii)    PRINCIPAL DRAWS ON SERIES 2002-4 LETTERS OF CREDIT. If
          the Administrator determines on any Distribution Date during the
          Series 2002-4 Amortization Period that there exists a Series 2002-4
          Lease Principal Payment Deficit, the Administrator shall instruct the
          Trustee in writing to draw on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit, if
          any, as provided below. Upon receipt of a notice by the Trustee from
          the Administrator in respect of a Series 2002-4 Lease Principal
          Payment Deficit on or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a
          Distribution Date, the Trustee shall, by 12:00 noon (New York City
          time) on such Distribution Date draw an amount as set forth in such
          notice equal to the least of (i) such Series 2002-4 Lease Principal

          on such Distribution Date exceeds the amount to be deposited in the
          Series 2002-4 Distribution Account in accordance with clause (i) of
          this Section 3.5(c) and (iii) the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit
          Amount, on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit by presenting to each
          Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Provider a draft accompanied by a

          Disbursements to be deposited in the Series 2002-4 Distribution
          Account on such Distribution Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the
          Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account has been established and funded,
          the Trustee shall withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral
          Account and deposit in the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account an

                (iii)   DEMAND NOTE DRAW. If on any Determination Date, the
          Administrator determines that the Principal Deficit Amount on the next
          succeeding Distribution Date (after giving effect to any withdrawal
          from the Series 2002-2 Reserve Account pursuant to Section 3.5(c)(i)
          on such Distribution Date) will be greater than zero and there are any
          Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit on such date, prior to 10:00 a.m. (New
          York City time) on the second Business Day prior to such Distribution
          Date, the Administrator shall instruct the Trustee in writing to

          of a period of 60 consecutive days) with respect to a Demand Note
          Issuer shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall not be
          required to deliver such Demand Notice to such Demand Note Issuer. The
          Trustee shall cause the proceeds of any demand on the Series 2002-4
          Demand Notes to be deposited into the Series 2002-4 Distribution
          Account.

          60 consecutive days) with respect to one or more of the Demand Note
          Issuers, the Trustee shall not have delivered such Demand Notice to
          any Demand Note Issuer on the second Business Day preceding the Series

          York City time) on such Business Day an amount equal to the lesser of
          (a) the amount that the Demand Note Issuers failed to pay under the

          Trustee shall withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account
          and deposit in the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account an amount equal
          to the lesser of (x) the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Percentage on
          such Business Day of the amount that the Demand Note Issuers failed to
          pay under the Series 2002-4 Demand Notes (or, the amount that the
          Trustee failed to demand for payment thereunder) and (y) the Series
          2002-4 Available Cash Collateral Account Amount on such Business Day
          and draw an amount equal to the remainder of the amount that the
          Demand Note Issuers failed to pay under the Series 2002-4 Demand Notes
          (or, the amount that the Trustee failed to demand for payment
          thereunder) on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit. The Trustee shall
          deposit, or cause the deposit of, the proceeds of any draw on the
          Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit and the proceeds of any withdrawal

                (iii)   LETTER OF CREDIT DRAW. In the event that either (x) on
          or prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day prior
          to such Distribution Date, any Demand Note Issuer shall have failed to

          that the Trustee failed to demand for payment thereunder) by
          presenting to each Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Provider a draft
          accompanied by a Certificate of Unpaid Demand Note Demand; PROVIDED,
          HOWEVER, that if the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account has been
          established and funded, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Series
          2002-4 Cash Collateral Account and deposit in the Series 2002-4

respect to a Non-Extending Purchaser Group a PRO RATA amount of the Decrease,
based on the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to such Non-Extending
Purchaser Group relative to the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to
all Non-Extending Purchaser Groups on the date of such Decrease and second, to
each Funding Agent with respect to a Purchaser Group, such Purchaser Group's Pro
Rata Share of the remaining amount of such Decrease. Each Purchaser Group's
share of the amount of any Decrease on any Business Day shall be allocated by
such Purchaser Group first to reduce the Available CP Funding Amount with
respect to such Purchaser Group and the Available APA Bank Funding Amount with
respect to such Purchaser Group on such Business Day and then to reduce the
portion of the Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to such Purchaser
Group allocated to CP Tranches and Eurodollar Tranches in such order as such
Purchaser Group may select in order to minimize costs payable pursuant to
Section 7.3. Upon the receipt of funds from the Trustee pursuant to Sections

Agreement or any other Related Document (including applicable grace periods),
the Trustee shall make such payment or deposit into or from the Collection
Account

                                      -45-
<Page>

without such notice or instruction from the Administrator, PROVIDED that the
Administrator, upon request of the Trustee, promptly provides the Trustee with
all information necessary to allow the Trustee to make such a payment or
deposit. When any payment or deposit hereunder or under any other Related
Document is required to be made by the Trustee or the Paying Agent at or prior
to a specified time, the Administrator shall deliver any applicable written
instructions with respect thereto reasonably in advance of such specified time.

          Section 3.7. SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE ACCOUNT. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF
SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE ACCOUNT. AFC-II shall establish and maintain in the name
of the Series 2002-4 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-4 Noteholders, or
cause to be established and maintained, an account (the "SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE
ACCOUNT"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited
therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-4 Noteholders. The Series
2002-4 Reserve Account shall be maintained (i) with a Qualified Institution, or
(ii) as a segregated trust account with the corporate trust department of a
depository institution or trust company having corporate trust powers and acting
as trustee for funds deposited in the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account; PROVIDED
that, if at any time such Qualified Institution is no longer a Qualified
Institution or the credit rating of any securities issued by such depositary
institution or trust company shall be reduced to below "BBB-" by S&P or "Baa2"
by Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within 30 days of such reduction, establish a new
Series 2002-4 Reserve Account with a new Qualified Institution. If the Series
2002-4 Reserve Account is not maintained in accordance with the previous
sentence, AFC-II shall establish a new Series 2002-4 Reserve Account, within ten
(10) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of such fact, which complies with
such sentence, and shall instruct the Series 2002-4 Agent in writing to transfer
all cash and investments from the non-qualifying Series 2002-4 Reserve Account
into the new Series 2002-4 Reserve Account. Initially, the Series 2002-4 Reserve
Account will be established with The Bank of New York.

          (b)   ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE ACCOUNT. The
Administrator may instruct the institution maintaining the Series 2002-4 Reserve
Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account from
time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
investment shall mature not later than the Business Day prior to the
Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were received, unless
any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account is held with
the Paying Agent, then such investment may mature on such Distribution Date and
such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such Distribution
Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to the Series 2002-4
Reserve Account and any such Permitted Investments that constitute (i) physical
property (and that is not either a United States security entitlement or a
security entitlement) shall be physically delivered to the Trustee; (ii) United
States security entitlements or security entitlements shall be controlled (as
defined in Section 8-106 of the New York UCC) by the Trustee pending maturity or
disposition, and (iii) uncertificated securities (and not United States security
entitlements) shall be delivered to the Trustee by causing the Trustee to become
the registered holder of such securities.

          (c)   EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE ACCOUNT. All interest and
earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds on deposit in the
Series 2002-4 Reserve Account shall be deemed to be on deposit therein and
available for distribution.

New York UCC) with respect to the Series 2002-4 Reserve Account; (ii) that each

treated as a financial asset (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York
UCC) and (iii) to comply with any entitlement order (as defined in Section
8-102(a)(8) of the New York UCC) issued by the Trustee.

          (e)   PREFERENCE AMOUNT WITHDRAWALS FROM THE SERIES 2002-4 RESERVE
ACCOUNT OR THE SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. If a member of a Purchaser
Group notifies the Trustee in writing of the existence of a Preference Amount,
then, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the next

Section 3.7(e), the Trustee shall have received (i) a certified copy of the
order requiring the return of such Preference Amount; (ii) an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to the Trustee that such order is final and not subject to appeal;
and (iii) a release as to any claim against AFC-II by the Purchaser Group for

prior to the date of any drawing under a Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit pursuant
to Section 3.8(b) or (c) above, AFC-II shall establish and maintain in the name
of the Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2002-4 Noteholders, or cause to be
established and maintained, an account (the "SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL
ACCOUNT"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited
therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-4 Noteholders. The Series
2002-4 Cash Collateral Account shall be maintained (i) with a Qualified
Institution, or (ii) as a segregated trust account with the corporate trust
department of a depository institution or trust company having corporate trust
powers and acting as trustee for funds deposited in the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account; PROVIDED that, if at any time such Qualified Institution is
no longer a Qualified Institution or the credit rating of any securities issued
by such depository institution or trust company shall be reduced to below "BBB-"
by S&P or "Baa3" by Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within 30 days of such
reduction, establish a new Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account with a new
Qualified Institution or a new segregated trust account with the corporate trust
department of a depository institution or trust company having corporate trust
powers and acting as trustee for funds deposited in the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account. If a new Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account is
established, AFC-II shall instruct the Trustee in writing to transfer all cash
and investments from the non-qualifying Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account
into the new Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account.

          (f)   ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.
AFC-II may instruct (by standing instructions or otherwise) the institution
maintaining the Series 2002-4

Cash Collateral Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account from time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any such investment shall mature not later than the Business Day
prior to the Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were
received, unless any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account is held with the Paying Agent, in which case such investment
may mature on such Distribution Date so long as such funds shall be available
for withdrawal on or prior to such Distribution Date. All such Permitted
Investments will be credited to the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account and
any such Permitted Investments that constitute (i) physical property (and that
is not either a United States security entitlement or a security entitlement)
shall be physically delivered to the Trustee; (ii) United States security
entitlements or security entitlements shall be controlled (as defined in Section
8-106 of the New York UCC) by the Trustee pending maturity or disposition, and
(iii) uncertificated securities (and not United States security entitlements)
shall be delivered to the Trustee by causing the Trustee to become the
registered holder of such securities. The Trustee shall, at the expense of
AFC-II, take such action as is required to maintain the Trustee's security
interest in the Permitted Investments credited to the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account. AFC-II shall not direct the Trustee to dispose of (or permit
the disposal of) any Permitted Investments prior to the maturity thereof to the
extent such disposal would result in a loss of principal of such Permitted
Investment. In the absence of written investment instructions hereunder, funds
on deposit in the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account shall remain uninvested.

          (g)   EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. All
interest and earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds on
deposit in the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account shall be deemed to be on
deposit therein and available for distribution.

          (h)   SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT SURPLUS. In the event that
the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account Surplus on any Distribution Date (or,
after the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Termination Date, on any date) is
greater than zero, the Trustee, acting in accordance with the written
instructions of the Administrator, shall withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Cash
Collateral Account an amount equal to the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account
Surplus and shall pay such amount: FIRST, to the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit
Providers to the extent of any unreimbursed drawings under the related Series
2002-4 Reimbursement Agreement, for application in accordance with the
provisions of the related Series 2002-4 Reimbursement Agreement, and, SECOND, to
AFC-II any remaining amount.

          (i)   TERMINATION OF SERIES 2002-4 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. Upon the
termination of this Supplement in accordance with its terms, the Trustee, acting
in accordance with the written instructions of the Administrator, after the
prior payment of all amounts owing to the Series 2002-4 Noteholders and payable
from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account as provided herein, shall
withdraw from the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account all amounts on deposit
therein (to the extent not withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.8(h) above) and shall
pay such amounts: FIRST, to the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Providers to the
extent of any unreimbursed drawings under the related Series 2002-4
Reimbursement Agreement, for application in accordance with the provisions of
the related Series 2002-4 Reimbursement Agreement, and, SECOND, to AFC-II any
remaining amount.

          (j)   TERMINATION DATE DEMANDS ON THE SERIES 2002-4 LETTERS OF CREDIT.
Prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately
succeeding the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Termination Date, the
Administrator shall determine the Series 2002-4 Demand Note Payment Amount as of
the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Termination Date. If the Series 2002-4 Demand
Note Payment Amount is greater than zero, then the Administrator shall instruct
the Trustee in writing to draw on the Series 2002-4 Letters of Credit. Upon
receipt of any such notice by the Trustee on or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on a Business Day, the Trustee shall, by 12:00 noon (New York City
time) on such Business Day draw an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess
of the Series 2002-4 Demand Note Payment Amount over the Series 2002-4 Available
Reserve Account Amount (prior to giving effect to any transfer to the Series
2002-4 Cash Collateral Account pursuant to Section 3.7(e) on such date) and (ii)
the Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Liquidity Amount on the Series 2002-4 Letters
of Credit by presenting to each Series 2002-4 Letter of Credit Provider a draft
accompanied by a Certificate of Termination Date Demand; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account has been established and funded,
the Trustee shall draw an amount equal to the product of (a) 100% minus the
Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Percentage and (b) the lesser of the amounts
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) on such Business Day on the Series 2002-4
Letters of Credit as calculated by the Administrator and provided in writing to
the Trustee. The Trustee shall cause the Termination Date Disbursement to be
deposited in the Series 2002-4 Cash Collateral Account.

          Section 3.9. SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF
SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. The Trustee shall establish and maintain in
the name of the Series 2002-4 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-4
Noteholders, or cause to be established and maintained, an account (the "SERIES
2002-4 DISTRIBUTION Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the
funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-4
Noteholders. The Series 2002-4 Distribution Account shall be maintained (i) with
a Qualified Institution, or (ii) as a segregated trust account with the
corporate trust department of a depository institution or trust company having
corporate trust powers and acting as trustee for funds deposited in the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account; PROVIDED that, if at any time such Qualified
Institution is no longer a Qualified Institution or the credit rating of any
securities issued by such depositary institution or trust company shall be
reduced to below "BBB-" by S&P or "Baa3" by Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within
30 days of such reduction, establish a new Series 2002-4 Distribution Account
with a new Qualified Institution. If the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account is
not maintained in accordance with the previous sentence, AFC-II shall establish
a new Series 2002-4 Distribution Account, within ten (10) Business Days after
obtaining knowledge of such fact, which complies with such sentence, and shall
instruct the Series 2002-4 Agent in writing to transfer all cash and investments
from the non-qualifying Series 2002-4 Distribution Account into the new Series
2002-4 Distribution Account. Initially, the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account
will be established with The Bank of New York.

          (b)   ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. The
Administrator may instruct the institution maintaining the Series 2002-4
Distribution Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-4
Distribution Account from time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any such investment shall mature not later than the Business Day
prior to the Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were
received, unless any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-4 Distribution
Account is held

                                      -52-
<Page>

with the Paying Agent, then such investment may mature on such Distribution Date
and such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such
Distribution Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account and any such Permitted Investments that constitute
(i) physical property (and that is not either a United States security
entitlement or a security entitlement) shall be physically delivered to the
Trustee; (ii) United States security entitlements or security entitlements shall
be controlled (as defined in Section 8-106 of the New York UCC) by the Trustee
pending maturity or disposition, and (iii) uncertificated securities (and not
United States security entitlements) shall be delivered to the Trustee by
causing the Trustee to become the registered holder of such securities.

          (c)   EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. All interest
and earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds on deposit in
the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account shall be deemed to be on deposit and
available for distribution.

          (d)   SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT CONSTITUTES ADDITIONAL
COLLATERAL FOR SERIES 2002-4 NOTES. In order to secure and provide for the
repayment and payment of the AFC-II Obligations with respect to the Series
2002-4 Notes, AFC-II hereby grants a security interest in and assigns, pledges,
grants, transfers and sets over to the Series 2002-4 Agent, for the benefit of
the Series 2002-4 Noteholders, all of AFC-II's right, title and interest in and

2002-4 Distribution Account, whether constituting securities, instruments,
general intangibles, investment property, financial assets or other property;
(v) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property from time to
time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange
for the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account, the funds on deposit therein from
time to time or the investments made with such funds; and (vi) all proceeds of
any and all of the foregoing, including, without limitation, cash (the items in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) are referred to, collectively, as the
"SERIES 2002-4 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT COLLATERAL"). The Series 2002-4 Agent shall
possess all right, title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time
in the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account and in and to all proceeds thereof,
and shall be the only person authorized to originate entitlement orders in
respect of the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account. The Series 2002-4
Distribution Account Collateral shall be under the sole dominion and control of
the Series 2002-4 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-4 Noteholders. The
Series 2002-4 Agent hereby agrees (i) to act as the securities intermediary (as
defined in Section 8-102(a)(14) of the New York UCC) with respect to the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account; (ii) that each item of property (whether investment
property, financial asset, security, instrument or cash) credited to the Series
2002-4 Distribution Account shall be treated as a financial asset (as defined in
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York UCC) and (iii) to comply with any
entitlement order (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the New York UCC) issued
by the Trustee.

          Section 3.10. SERIES 2002-4 DEMAND NOTES CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL
COLLATERAL FOR SERIES 2002-4 NOTES. In order to secure and provide for the
repayment and payment of the obligations with respect to the Series 2002-4
Notes, AFC-II hereby grants a security interest in and assigns, pledges, grants,
transfers and sets over to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Series

Group) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later

                                    ARTICLE V

                      RIGHT TO WAIVE PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS

          Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture or the
Related Documents, upon the Trustee's receipt of notice from any Lessee, any
Borrower or AFC-II (i) to the effect that a Manufacturer Program is no longer an
Eligible Manufacturer Program and that, as a result, either the Series 2002-4
Maximum Non-Program Vehicle Amount is or will be exceeded or (ii) that the
Lessees, the Borrowers and AFC-II have determined to increase any Series 2002-4
Maximum Amount (such notice, a "WAIVER REQUEST"), each Series 2002-4 Noteholder
may, at its option, waive the Series 2002-4 Maximum Non-Program Vehicle Amount,
any other Series 2002-4 Maximum Amount (collectively, a "WAIVABLE AMOUNT") if
(i) no Amortization Event exists, (ii) the Requisite Noteholders consent to such
waiver and (iii) 60 days' prior written notice of such proposed waiver is
provided to the Rating Agencies by the Trustee.

          Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Waiver Request (a copy of which the
Trustee shall promptly provide to the Rating Agencies), all amounts which would
otherwise be allocated to the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection Account
(collectively, the "DESIGNATED AMOUNTS") from the date the Trustee receives a
Waiver Request through the Consent Period Expiration Date will be held by the
Trustee in the Series 2002-4 Collection Account for ratable distribution as
described below.

          Within ten (10) Business Days after the Trustee receives a Waiver
Request, the Trustee shall furnish notice thereof to the Administrative Agent,
which notice shall be accompanied by a form of consent (each a "CONSENT") in the
form of EXHIBIT C hereto by which the Series 2002-4 Noteholders may, on or
before the Consent Period Expiration Date, consent to waiver of the applicable
Waivable Amount. Upon receipt of notice of a Waiver Request, the Administrative
Agent shall forward a copy of such request together with the Consent to the
Funding Agent with respect to each Purchaser Group. If the Trustee receives the
Consents from the Requisite Noteholders agreeing to waiver of the applicable
Waivable Amount within forty-five (45) days after the Trustee notifies the
Administrative Agent of a Waiver Request (the day on which such forty-five (45)
day period expires, the "CONSENT PERIOD EXPIRATION DATE"), (i) the applicable
Waivable Amount shall be deemed waived by the consenting Series 2002-4
Noteholders, (ii) the Trustee will distribute the Designated Amounts as set
forth below and (iii) the Trustee shall promptly (but in any event within two
days) provide the Rating Agency with notice of such waiver. Any Purchaser Group
from whom the Trustee has not received a Consent on or before the Consent Period
Expiration Date will be deemed not to have consented to such waiver.

          If the Trustee receives Consents from the Requisite Noteholders on or
before the Consent Period Expiration Date, then on the immediately following
Distribution Date, upon receipt of written direction from the Administrator the
Trustee will pay the Designated Amounts to the Administrative Agent for the
accounts of the non-consenting Purchaser Groups. Upon the

                                      -56-
<Page>

receipt of funds from the Trustee pursuant to this Article V, the Administrative
Agent shall pay the Designated Amounts as follows:

          (i)   to each Funding Agent with respect to a non-consenting Purchaser
     Group, such Purchaser Group's PRO RATA share based on the Purchaser Group
     Invested Amount with respect to such Purchaser Group relative to the
     Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to all non-consenting
     Purchaser Groups of the Designated Amounts up to the amount required to
     reduce to zero the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to all
     non-consenting Purchaser Groups; and

          (ii)  any remaining Designated Amounts to the Series 2002-4 Excess
     Collection Account.

          If the amount distributed pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding
paragraph is not sufficient to reduce the Purchaser Group Invested Amount with
respect to each non-consenting Purchaser Group to zero on the date specified
therein, then on each day following such Distribution Date, the Administrator
will allocate to the Series 2002-4 Collection Account on a daily basis all
Designated Amounts collected on such day. On each following Distribution Date,
the Trustee will withdraw such Designated Amounts from the Series 2002-4
Collection Account and deposit the same in the Series 2002-4 Distribution
Account for distribution to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the
non-consenting Purchaser Groups. Upon the receipt of funds from the Trustee
pursuant to this Article V, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Designated
Amounts as follows:

          (a)   to each Funding Agent with respect to a non-consenting Purchaser
     Group, such Purchaser Group's PRO RATA share based on the Purchaser Group
     Invested Amount with respect to such Purchaser Group relative to the
     Purchaser Group Invested Amount with respect to all non-consenting
     Purchaser Groups of the Designated Amounts in the Series 2002-4 Collection
     Account as of the applicable Determination Date up to the amount required
     to reduce to zero the Purchaser Group Invested Amounts with respect to all
     non-consenting Purchaser Groups; and

          (b)   any remaining Designated Amounts to the Series 2002-4 Excess
     Collection Account.

          If the Requisite Noteholders do not timely consent to such waiver, the
Designated Amounts will be re-allocated to the Series 2002-4 Excess Collection
Account for allocation and distribution in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the Related Documents.

          In the event that the Series 2002-4 Amortization Period shall commence
after receipt by the Trustee of a Waiver Request, all such Designated Amounts
will thereafter be considered Principal Collections allocated to the Series
2002-4 Noteholders.

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          Section 7.1. INCREASED COSTS. (a) If any Change in Law (except with
respect to Taxes which shall be governed by Section 7.2) shall:

          (i)   impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
     or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
     of, or credit extended by, any Affected Party (except any such reserve
     requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

          (ii)  impose on any Affected Party or the London interbank market any
     other condition affecting the Indenture or the Related Documents or the
     funding of Eurodollar Tranches by such Affected Party;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Affected Party of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar
Tranches (or maintaining its obligation to do so) or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Affected Party hereunder or in connection
herewith (whether principal, interest or otherwise), then AFC-II will pay to
such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Affected Party for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)   If any Affected Party determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Affected Party's capital or the capital of any corporation
controlling such Affected Party as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which such Affected Party or such corporation could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Affected
Party's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time, AFC-II shall pay to such Affected Party such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for any such reduction
suffered.

          (c)   A certificate of an Affected Party setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party as specified in subsections
(a) and (b) of this Section 7.1 shall be delivered to AFC-II (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent and the Funding Agent with respect to such Affected Party)
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any payments made by AFC-II
pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be made solely from funds available in the
Series 2002-4 Distribution Account for the payment of Article VII Costs, shall
be non-recourse other than with respect to such funds, and shall not constitute
a claim

                                      -62-
<Page>

against AFC-II to the extent that insufficient funds exist to make such payment.
The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Supplement
and the Base Indenture and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and
thereunder.

          (d)   Failure or delay on the part of an Affected Party to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Affected Party's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that AFC-II shall
not be required to compensate any Affected Party pursuant to this Section 7.1
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the
date that such Affected Party notifies AFC-II of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Affected Party's intention to
claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          Section 7.2. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of AFC-II hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if AFC-II
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) subject to Section 7.2(c) below, the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 7.2) the
recipient receives an amount equal to the sum that it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) AFC-II shall make such deductions and (iii)
AFC-II shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law.

          (b)   In addition, AFC-II shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c)   AFC-II shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Funding
Agent, each Program Support Provider and each member of each Purchaser Group
within the later of 10 days after written demand therefor and the Distribution
Date next following such demand for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Funding Agent, such Program
Support Provider or such member of such Purchaser Group on or with respect to
any payment by or on account of any obligation of AFC-II hereunder or under the
Indenture (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 7.2) and any penalties,
interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; PROVIDED that no
Person shall be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) or entitled to
receive additional amounts under the proviso of Section 7.2(a) to the extent
that the reason for such indemnification results from the failure by such Person
to comply with the provisions of Section 7.2(e) or (g). A certificate as to the
amount of such payment or liability delivered to AFC-II by the Administrative
Agent, any Funding Agent, any Program Support Provider or any member of any
Purchaser Group shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any payments made by
AFC-II pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be made solely from funds available in
the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account for the payment of Article VII Costs,
shall be non-recourse other than with respect to such funds, and shall not
constitute a claim against AFC-II to the extent that insufficient funds exist to
make such payment. The agreements in this Section shall survive the

                                      -63-
<Page>

termination of this Supplement and the Base Indenture and the payment of all
amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.

          (d)   As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by AFC-II to a Governmental Authority, AFC-II shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

          (e)   The Administrative Agent, each Funding Agent, each member of
each Purchaser Group and each Program Support Provider, if entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax with respect to
payments made hereunder or under the Indenture shall (to the extent legally able
to do so) deliver to AFC-II (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and
reasonably requested by AFC-II on the later of (i) 30 Business Days after such
request is made and the applicable forms are provided to the Administrative
Agent, such Funding Agent, such member of such Purchaser Group or such Program
Support Provider or (ii) 30 Business Days before prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or with an exemption
from or reduction of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.

          (f)   If the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent, any Program
Support Provider or any member of any Purchaser Group receives a refund solely
in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, it shall pay over such refund to
AFC-II to the extent that it has already received indemnity payments or
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 7.2 with respect to such Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to the refund, net of all out-of-pocket
expenses and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
AFC-II shall, upon request of the Administrative Agent, such Funding Agent, such
Program Support Provider or such member of such Purchaser Group, repay such
refund (plus interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Funding Agent, such Program Support
Provider or such member of such Purchaser Group if the Administrative Agent,
such Funding Agent, such Program Support Provider or such member of such
Purchaser Group is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Administrative Agent, any Funding
Agent, any Program Support Provider or any member of any Purchaser Group to make
its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) available to AFC-II or any other Person.

          (g)   The Administrative Agent, each Funding Agent, each Program
Support Provider and each member of each Purchaser Group (other than any such
entity which is a domestic corporation) shall:

          (i)   upon or prior to becoming a party hereto, deliver to AFC-II and
     the Administrative Agent two (2) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN,
     W-8ECI or W-9, or successor applicable forms, as the case may be,
     establishing a complete exemption from withholding of United States federal
     income taxes or backup

                                      -64-
<Page>

     withholding taxes with respect to payments under the Series 2002-4 Notes
     and this Supplement;

          (ii)  deliver to AFC-II and the Administrative Agent two (2) further
     copies of any such form or certification establishing a complete exemption
     from withholding of United States federal income taxes or backup
     withholding taxes with respect to payments under the Series 2002-4 Notes
     and this Supplement on or before the date that any such form or
     certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any
     event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it
     to AFC-II; and

          (iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and completing such
     forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by AFC-II and the
     Administrative Agent;

unless, in any such case, any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred
after the Series 2002-4 Closing Date (or, if later, the date the Administrative
Agent, such Funding Agent, such Program Support Provider or such member of such
Purchaser Group becomes an indemnified party hereunder) and prior to the date on
which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders the relevant
form inapplicable or which would prevent the Administrative Agent, such Funding
Agent, such Program Support Provider or such member of such Purchaser Group from
duly completing and delivering the relevant form with respect to it, and the
Administrative Agent, such Funding Agent, such Program Support Provider or such
member of such Purchaser Group so advises AFC-II and the Administrative Agent.

          (h)   If a beneficial or equity owner of the Administrative Agent, a
Funding Agent, a Program Support Provider or a member of a Purchaser Group
(instead of the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agent, the Program Support
Provider or the member of the Purchaser Group itself) is required under United
States federal income tax law or the terms of a relevant treaty to provide IRS
Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-9, or any successor applicable forms, as the case may
be, in order to claim an exemption from withholding of United States federal
income taxes or backup withholding taxes, then each such beneficial owner or
equity owner shall be considered to be the Administrative Agent, a Funding
Agent, a Program Support Provider or a member of a Purchaser Group for purposes
of Section 7.2(g).

          Section 7.3. BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. AFC-II agrees to indemnify each
Purchaser Group and to hold each Purchaser Group harmless from any loss or
expense which such Purchaser Group may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)
the failure by AFC-II to accept any Increase after AFC-II has given irrevocable
notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Supplement,
(b) the conversion into or continuation of a CP Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche
that occurs other than on the last day of the applicable CP Rate Period or
Eurodollar Period, (c) default by AFC-II in making any prepayment in connection
with a Decrease after AFC-II has given irrevocable notice thereof in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.5 or (d) the making of a prepayment of a CP
Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche (including, without limitation, any Decrease)
prior to the termination of the CP Rate Period for such CP Tranche or the
Eurodollar Period for such Eurodollar Tranche, as the case may be, or the making
of a Decrease on a date other than as specified in any notice of a Decrease or
in a greater amount than contained in any notice of a Decrease. Such
indemnification shall include an amount determined by the Funding Agent with
respect to such Purchaser Group and shall

                                      -65-
<Page>

equal (a) in the case of the losses or expenses associated with a CP Tranche or
a Eurodollar Tranche, either (x) the excess, if any, of (i) such Purchaser
Group's cost of funding the amount so prepaid or not so borrowed, converted or
continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to
borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the CP Rate Period or the
Eurodollar Period (or in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue,
the CP Rate Period or the Eurodollar Period that would have commenced on the
date of such prepayment or of such failure), as the case may be, over (ii) the
amount of interest earned by such Purchaser Group upon redeployment of an amount
of funds equal to the amount prepaid or not borrowed, converted or continued for
a comparable period or (y) if such Purchaser Group is able to terminate the
funding source before its scheduled maturity, any costs associated with such
termination and (b) in the case of the losses or expenses incurred by a Pooled
Funding CP Conduit Purchaser, the losses and expenses incurred by such Pooled
Funding CP Conduit Purchaser in connection with the liquidation or reemployment
of deposits or other funds acquired by such Pooled Funding CP Conduit Purchaser
as a result of the failure to accept an Increase, a default in the making of a
Decrease or the making of a Decrease in an amount or on a date not contained in
a notice of a Decrease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments made by
AFC-II pursuant to this subsection shall be made solely from funds available in
the Series 2002-4 Distribution Account for the payment of Article VII Costs,
shall be non-recourse other than with respect to such funds, and shall not
constitute a claim against AFC-II to the extent that such funds are insufficient
to make such payment. This covenant shall survive the termination of this
Supplement and the Base Indenture and the payment of all amounts payable
hereunder and thereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by any Funding Agent on behalf of a
Purchaser Group to AFC-II shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          Section 7.4. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to the commencement
of any Eurodollar Period:

          (a)   the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
     be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
     not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar
     Period, or

          (b)   the Administrative Agent is advised by any APA Bank that the
     Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar Period will not adequately and
     fairly reflect the cost to such APA Bank of making or maintaining the
     Eurodollar Tranches during such Eurodollar Period,

then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give telecopy or telephonic notice
thereof to AFC-II and the Trustee, whereupon until the Administrative Agent
notifies AFC-II and the Trustee that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, the Available APA Bank Funding Amount with respect to
any Purchaser Group (in the case of clause (a) above) or with respect to the
related Purchaser Group (in the case of clause (b) above) shall not be allocated
to any Eurodollar Tranche.

          Section 7.5. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS. If an Affected Party requests
compensation under Section 7.1, or if AFC-II is required to pay any additional
amount to any Purchaser Group or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Purchaser Group pursuant to Section 7.2,

                                      -66-
<Page>

then, upon written notice from AFC-II, such Affected Party or Purchaser Group,
as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its obligations hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, which pays a price for such assignment which is acceptable to
such Purchaser Group and its assignee, in the judgment of such Affected Party or
Purchaser Group, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Affected Party or Purchaser Group to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Affected Party or Purchaser Group. AFC-II hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Party or Purchaser Group in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

     regular business hours, upon reasonable prior notice (and with one Business
     Day's prior notice if an Amortization Event with respect to the Series
     2002-4 Notes shall have been deemed to have occurred or shall have been
     declared to have occurred), for purposes of inspection and shall permit
     such Funding Agent, the Trustee or any representative of such Funding Agent
     or the Trustee to visit any of AFC-II's or the Administrator's, as the case
     may be, offices or properties during regular business hours and as often as

     or AFC-II pursuant to the Related Documents as such information relates to
     all Series of Notes generally or specifically to the Series 2002-4 Notes or
     the Series 2002-4 Collateral. The Administrative Agent shall distribute to
     the Funding Agents copies of all information delivered to it pursuant to
     this Section 8.2(d);

          (e)   AFC-II shall not, and the Administrator shall not permit AFC-II
     to, make any Loan under the Loan Agreements to finance the purchase of any

     Budget Group, Inc. without the written consent of each Purchaser Group; and

          (f)   they shall not agree to any amendment to the Base Indenture or
     any other Related Document, which amendment requires the consent of the
     Requisite Investors, without having received the prior written consent of
     the Requisite Noteholders.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

          Section 9.1. APPOINTMENT. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA
Banks and the Funding Agents hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
Administrative Agent as the agent of such Person under this Supplement and
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Supplement and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Supplement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary elsewhere in this Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities except those

                                      -68-
<Page>

expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any CP Conduit
Purchaser, any APA Bank or any Funding Agent, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Supplement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

          Section 9.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may
execute any of its duties under this Supplement by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

          Section 9.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with the Base Indenture, this
Supplement or any other Related Document (except to the extent that any of the
foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks or the Funding Agents for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by AFC-II, the Lessors, the
Lessees, the Guarantor, the Administrator or any officer thereof contained in
this Supplement or any other Related Document or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Supplement or any other
Related Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Supplement, any other Related Document, or
for any failure of any of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor or the
Administrator to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any CP Conduit
Purchaser, any APA Bank or any Funding Agent to ascertain or to inquire as to
the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Supplement, any other Related Document or to inspect the
properties, books or records of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor
or the Administrator.

          Section 9.4. RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to AFC-II or the
Administrator), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the registered
holder of any Series 2002-4 Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Supplement or any
other Related Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence
of the Requisite Noteholders, as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Funding Agents against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining

                                      -69-
<Page>

from acting, under this Supplement and the other Related Documents in accordance
with a request of the Requisite Noteholders (unless, in the case of any action
relating to the giving of consent hereunder, the giving of such consent requires
the consent of all Series 2002-4 Noteholders), and such request and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the CP
Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks and the Funding Agents.

          Section 9.5. NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATOR DEFAULT OR AMORTIZATION EVENT OR
POTENTIAL AMORTIZATION EVENT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Amortization Event or
Potential Amortization Event or any Administrator Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a CP Conduit Purchaser, an
APA Bank, a Funding Agent, AFC-II or the Administrator referring to the
Indenture or this Supplement, describing such Amortization Event or Potential
Amortization Event, or Administrator Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of an Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event" or "notice of
an Administrator Default," as the case may be. In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Funding Agents, the Trustee, AFC-II and the Administrator.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as
shall be reasonably directed by the Requisite Noteholders, PROVIDED that unless
and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such event as it shall deem
advisable in the best interests of the Purchaser Groups.

          Section 9.6. NON-RELIANCE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER
PURCHASER GROUPS. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks and the
Funding Agents expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor or the Administrator shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent
to any such Person. Each of the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks and the
Funding Agents represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other CP Conduit
Purchaser, APA Bank or Funding Agent and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor and the
Administrator and made its own decision to enter into this Supplement. Each of
the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks and the Funding Agents also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent
or any other CP Conduit Purchaser, APA Bank or Funding Agent, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Supplement and the other Related Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor and the Administrator. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
the Funding Agents by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any CP Conduit Purchaser,
any APA Bank or any Funding Agent with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or

                                      -70-
<Page>

otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees,
the Guarantor or the Administrator which may come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

          Section 9.7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each of the APA Banks in a Purchaser
Group agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to
the extent not reimbursed by AFC-II and the Administrator and without limiting
the obligation of AFC-II and the Administrator to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7 (or if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the
Purchaser Group Invested Amounts shall have been reduced to zero, ratably in
accordance with their Commitment Percentages immediately prior to such date of
payment) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Supplement, any of the other Related Documents or any documents contemplated by
or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no APA Bank or Funding Agent
shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive
the payment of all amounts payable hereunder.

          Section 9.8. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with AFC-II, the Administrator or
any of their Affiliates as though the Administrative Agent were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder. With respect to any Series 2002-4 Note held by
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights
and powers under this Supplement and the other Related Documents as any APA Bank
or Funding Agent and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the terms "APA Bank," and "Funding Agent" shall
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

          Section 9.9. RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; SUCCESSOR
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative
Agent at any time by giving 30 days' notice to the Funding Agents, the Trustee,
AFC-II and the Administrator. If JPMorgan Chase shall resign as Administrative
Agent under this Supplement, then the Requisite Noteholders shall appoint a
successor administrative agent from among the Funding Agents, which successor
administrative agent shall be approved by AFC-II and the Administrator (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) whereupon such successor
agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative
Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent
effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative
Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated,
without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Supplement. If no successor
administrative

                                      -71-
<Page>

agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 10
days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Administrator shall assume and perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite
Noteholders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Supplement.

with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Funding Agent set forth next to such CP Conduit Purchaser's name on

authorizes such Funding Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Supplement and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to such Funding Agent by the
terms of this Supplement, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in
this Supplement, each Funding Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any CP Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Supplement or otherwise exist against each Funding Agent.

          Section 10.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Each Funding Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Supplement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact
and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. Each Funding Agent shall not be responsible to the CP Conduit
Purchaser or any APA Bank in its Purchaser Group for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care.

          Section 10.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Each Funding Agent and any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
shall not be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by
it or such Person under or in connection with the Base Indenture, this
Supplement or any other Related Document (except to the extent that any of the
foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the CP Conduit Purchasers and/or APA Banks for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, the Administrator, the Administrative Agent, or any officer thereof
contained in this Supplement or any other Related Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by such Funding Agent under or in connection with, this Supplement
or any other Related Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Supplement, any other Related
Document, or for any failure of any of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, or the Administrator to perform its
obligations hereunder or

                                      -72-
<Page>

thereunder. Each Funding Agent shall not be under any obligation to the CP
Conduit Purchaser or any APA Bank in its Purchaser Group to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, this Supplement, any other Related Document or to inspect
the properties, books or records of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, or the Administrator.

          Section 10.4. RELIANCE BY EACH FUNDING AGENT. Each Funding Agent shall
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,
without limitation, counsel to AFC-II or the Administrator), independent
accountants and other experts selected by such Funding Agent. Each Funding Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Supplement or any other Related Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Related Purchaser Group, as it deems appropriate or
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Related Purchaser Group
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.

          Section 10.5. NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATOR DEFAULT OR AMORTIZATION EVENT OR
POTENTIAL AMORTIZATION EVENT. Each Funding Agent shall not be deemed to have

Amortization Event or any Administrator Default unless such Funding Agent has
received written notice from a CP Conduit Purchaser, an APA Bank, AFC-II, the
Administrative Agent or the Administrator referring to the Indenture or this
Supplement, describing such Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event,
or Administrator Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of an
Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event" or "notice of an
Administrator Default," as the case may be. In the event that any Funding Agent
receives such a notice, such Funding Agent shall give notice thereof to the CP
Conduit Purchaser and APA Banks in its Purchaser Group. Such Funding Agent shall
take such action with respect to such event as shall be reasonably directed by
the CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Banks in its Purchaser Group, PROVIDED that
unless and until such Funding Agent shall have received such directions, such
Funding Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, with respect to such event as it shall deem advisable
in the best interests of the CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Banks in its Purchaser
Group.

          Section 10.6. NON-RELIANCE ON EACH FUNDING AGENT AND OTHER PURCHASER
GROUPS. Each CP Conduit Purchaser and each of the related APA Banks expressly
acknowledge that neither its Funding Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by such Funding Agent hereinafter taken,
including any review of the affairs of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, or the Administrator shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by such Funding Agent to any such
Person. Each CP Conduit Purchaser and each of the related APA Banks represents
to its Funding Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon such
Funding Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
AFC-II, the

                                      -73-

Administrator and made its own decision to enter into this Supplement. Each CP
Conduit Purchaser and each of the related APA Banks also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon its Funding Agent and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Supplement and the other Related Documents, and to
make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the

of AFC-II and the Administrator to do so), ratably according to its respective
APA Bank Percentage in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this Section 10.7 (or if indemnification is sought after the date upon
which the Commitments shall have been terminated, ratably in accordance with its
APA Bank Percentage at the time of termination) from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Funding Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Supplement, any of the other Related
Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by such Funding Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; PROVIDED
that no APA Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such related

          Section 11.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) This Supplement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that AFC-II may not assign or transfer any of its

its rights under this Supplement other than in accordance with the Asset
Purchase Agreement with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser or otherwise to the
APA Bank with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser or a Program Support Provider
with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser or pursuant to clause (b) or (e) below
of this Section 11.1 and no APA Bank may assign or transfer any of its rights or

it is a party to a Conduit Assignee with respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser.
Prior to or concurrently with the effectiveness of any such assignment (or if
impracticable, immediately thereafter), the assigning CP Conduit Purchaser shall

Agent hereunder or under the other Related Documents, (C) such Conduit Assignee
and its liquidity support provider(s) and credit support provider(s) and other
related parties shall have the benefit of all the rights and protections
provided to such CP Conduit Purchaser herein and in the other Related Documents
(including, without limitation, any limitation on recourse against such Conduit
Assignee as provided in this paragraph), (D) such Conduit Assignee shall assume
all of such CP Conduit Purchaser's obligations, if any, hereunder or under the
Base Indenture or under any other Related Document with respect to such portion
of the Purchaser Group Invested Amount and such CP Conduit Purchaser shall be
released from such obligations, (E) all distributions in respect of the
Purchaser Group Invested Amount or such portion thereof with respect to such CP
Conduit Purchaser shall be made to the applicable agent or administrative agent,
as applicable, on behalf of such Conduit Assignee, (F) the definitions of the
terms "Monthly Funding Costs" and "Discount" shall be determined in the manner

CP Conduit Purchaser), (G) the defined terms and other terms and provisions of
this Supplement, the Base Indenture and the other Related Documents shall be
interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, and (H) if requested by the

          (c)   Any APA Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell all or any part of its rights

in the form of EXHIBIT H (the "TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT"), executed by such Acquiring
APA Bank, such assigning APA Bank, the Funding Agent with respect to such APA
Bank, the Administrative Agent, AFC-II and the Administrator and delivered to
the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no APA Bank shall so
sell its rights hereunder if such Acquiring APA Bank is not an Eligible
Assignee.

          (d)   Any APA Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more financial
institutions or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participations in its APA Bank

                                      -75-
<Page>

respect to it and the other APA Banks included in the related Purchaser Group,
its Series 2002-4 Note and its rights hereunder pursuant to documentation in
form and substance satisfactory to such APA Bank and the Participant; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (i) in the event of any such sale by an APA Bank to a Participant,
(A) such APA Bank's obligations under this Supplement shall remain unchanged,
(B) such APA Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof
and (C) AFC-II and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such APA Bank in connection with its rights and obligations under
this Supplement and (ii) no APA Bank shall sell any participating interest under
which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or any
consent or waiver with respect to, this Supplement, the Base Indenture or any
Related Document, except to the extent that the approval of such amendment,
consent or waiver otherwise would require the unanimous consent of all APA Banks
hereunder. A Participant shall have the right to receive Article VII Costs but
only to the extent that the related selling APA Bank would have had such right
absent the sale of the related participation and, with respect to amounts due
pursuant to Section 7.2, only to the extent such Participant shall have complied
with the provisions of Section 7.2(e) and (g) as if such Participant were the
Administrative Agent, a Funding Agent, a Program Support Provider or a member of
a Purchaser Group.

          (e)   Any CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank with respect to such
CP Conduit Purchaser may at any time sell all or any part of their respective
rights and obligations under this Supplement and the Series 2002-4 Notes, with
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, AFC-II and the
Administrator (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
to a multi-seller commercial paper conduit and one or more banks providing
support to such multi-seller commercial paper conduit (an "ACQUIRING PURCHASER
GROUP") pursuant to a transfer supplement, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT
I (the "PURCHASER GROUP SUPPLEMENT"), executed by such Acquiring Purchaser
Group, the Funding Agent with respect to such Acquiring Purchaser Group
(including the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Banks with respect to such
Purchaser Group), such assigning CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Banks with
respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser, the Funding Agent with respect to such
assigning CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Banks, the Administrative Agent, AFC-II
and the Administrator and delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          (f)   AFC-II authorizes each APA Bank to disclose to any Participant
or Acquiring APA Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such APA Bank's possession concerning AFC-II,
the Collateral, the Administrator and the Related Documents which has been
delivered to such APA Bank by AFC-II or the Administrator in connection with
such APA Bank's credit evaluation of AFC-II, the Collateral and the
Administrator.

          Section 11.2. SECURITIES LAW. Each CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Bank
hereby represents and warrants to AFC-II that it is an "accredited investor" as
such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and
has sufficient assets to bear the economic risk of, and sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks
of, its investment in a Series 2002-4 Note. Each CP Conduit Purchaser and APA
Bank agrees that its Series 2002-4 Note will be acquired for investment only and
not with a view to any public distribution thereof, and that such CP Conduit
Purchaser and APA Bank will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of its Series
2002-4 Note (or any interest

                                      -76-
<Page>

therein) in violation of any of the registration requirements of the Securities
Act, or any applicable state or other securities laws. Each CP Conduit Purchaser
and APA Bank acknowledges that it has no right to require AFC-II to register its
Series 2002-4 Note under the Securities Act or any other securities law. Each CP
Conduit Purchaser and APA Bank hereby confirms and agrees that in connection
with any transfer by it of an interest in the Series 2002-4 Note, such CP
Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank has not engaged and will not engage in a general
solicitation or general advertising including advertisements, articles, notices
or other communications published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over radio or television, or any seminar or meeting whose attendees
have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.

          Section 11.3. ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any CP Conduit Purchaser or
APA Bank in a Purchaser Group (a "BENEFITTED PURCHASER GROUP") shall at any time
receive in respect of its Purchaser Group Invested Amount any distribution of
principal, interest, Commitment Fees or any interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off
or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such distribution received by any
other Purchaser Group, if any, in respect of such other Purchaser Group's
Purchaser Group Invested Amount, or interest thereon, the APA Banks in such
Benefitted Purchaser Group shall purchase for cash from the CP Conduit Purchaser
or APA Banks in the other Purchaser Group such portion of such other CP Conduit
Purchaser's or APA Banks' interest in the Series 2002-4 Notes, or shall provide
such other CP Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefitted Purchaser Group to share the excess payment or benefits of such
collateral or proceeds ratably with the other Purchaser Group; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Purchaser Group, such purchase shall
be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of
such recovery, but without interest. AFC-II agrees that any CP Conduit Purchaser
or APA Bank so purchasing a portion of another Purchaser Group's Purchaser Group
Invested Amount may exercise all rights of payment (including, without
limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such
CP Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank were the direct holder of such portion.

          (b)   In addition to any rights and remedies of the Purchaser Groups
provided by law, each CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Bank shall have the right,
without prior notice to AFC-II, any such notice being expressly waived by AFC-II
to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by AFC-II hereunder or under the Series 2002-4 Notes to set-off and
appropriate and apply against any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits,
indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Purchaser Group to or for the credit or the account of AFC-II.
Each CP Conduit Purchaser and APA Bank agrees promptly to notify AFC-II, the
Administrator and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such CP Conduit Purchaser or APA Bank; PROVIDED that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

          Section 11.4. NO BANKRUPTCY PETITION. (a) Each of the Administrative
Agent, the CP Conduit Purchasers, the APA Banks and the Funding Agents hereby
covenants and agrees that, prior to the date which is one year and one day after
the later of payment in full of all Series

                                      -77-

against, AFC-II any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings, or other similar proceedings under any federal or state
bankruptcy or similar law.

          (b)   AFC-II, the Trustee, the Administrative Agent, each Funding
Agent and each APA Bank hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date
which is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
Commercial Paper issued by, or for the benefit of, a CP Conduit Purchaser, it
will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against,
such CP Conduit Purchaser (or the Person issuing Commercial Paper for the
benefit of such CP Conduit Purchaser) any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other similar proceedings
under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law.

          (c)   This covenant shall survive the termination of this Supplement
and the Base Indenture and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and
thereunder.

          Section 11.5. LIMITED RECOURSE. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any obligations of each CP Conduit Purchaser
hereunder to any party hereto are solely the corporate obligations of such CP
Conduit Purchaser and shall be payable at such time as funds are received by or
are available to such CP Conduit Purchaser in excess of funds necessary to pay
in full all of its outstanding Commercial Paper and, to the extent funds are not
available to pay such obligations, the claims relating thereto shall not
constitute a claim against such CP Conduit Purchaser but shall continue to
accrue. Each party hereto agrees that the payment of any claim (as defined in
Section 101 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) of any such party against a CP
Conduit Purchaser shall be subordinated to the payment in full of all of its
Commercial Paper.

          (b)   No recourse under any obligation, covenant or agreement of any
CP Conduit Purchaser contained herein shall be had against any incorporator,
stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent of such CP Conduit Purchaser,
its administrative agent, the Funding Agent with respect to such CP Conduit
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute or otherwise; it
being expressly agreed and understood that this Supplement is solely a corporate
obligation of such CP Conduit Purchaser individually, and that no personal
liability whatever shall attach to or be incurred by any incorporator,
stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent of such CP Conduit Purchaser,
its administrative agent, the Funding Agent with respect to such CP Conduit
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) or any of
them under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements of
such CP Conduit Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or implied therefrom, and
that any and all personal liability for breaches by such CP Conduit Purchaser of
any of such obligations, covenants or agreements, either at common law or at
equity, or by statute, rule or regulation, of every such incorporator,
stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent is hereby expressly waived as
a condition of and in consideration for the execution of this Supplement;
PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not relieve any such Person from any liability
it might otherwise have as a result of fraudulent actions taken or omissions
made by them. The provisions of this Section 11.5 shall survive termination of
this Supplement.

          Section 11.17. COLLATERAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AFC-II.
AFC-II hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee, the Administrative Agent,
each Funding Agent and each Purchaser Group that:

          (a)   the Base Indenture creates a valid and continuing security
     interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Collateral in favor of
     the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, which security interest is
     prior to all other liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors
     of and purchasers from AFC-II. This Supplement will create a valid and
     continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the
     Series 2002-4 Collateral in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the
     Series 2002-4 Noteholders, which security interest is prior to all other
     liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and purchasers
     from AFC-II.

          (b)   The Collateral and the Series 2002-4 Collateral (in each case,
     other than the Vehicles) consist of "instruments," "general intangibles"
     and "deposit accounts" within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

          (c)   AFC-II owns and has good and marketable title to the Collateral
     and the Series 2002-4 Collateral free and clear of any lien, claim or
     encumbrance of any Person.

          (d)   With respect to the portion of the Collateral that consists of
     instruments, all original executed copies of each instrument that
     constitute or evidence part of the Collateral have been delivered to the
     Trustee. None of the instruments that constitute or evidence the Collateral
     have any marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged,
     assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Trustee.

          (e)   With respect to the portion of the Collateral that consists of
     general intangibles, AFC-II has caused the filing of all appropriate
     financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
     jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
     interest in the Collateral granted to the Trustee under the Base Indenture.

          (f)   With respect to the portion of the Collateral and the Series
     2002-4 Collateral that consists of deposit or securities accounts
     maintained with a bank other than the Trustee (collectively, the "BANK
     ACCOUNTS"), AFC-II has delivered to the Trustee a fully executed agreement
     pursuant to which the bank maintaining the Bank Accounts has agreed to
     comply with all instructions originated by the Trustee directing
     disposition of the funds in the Bank Accounts without further consent by
     AFC-II. The Bank Accounts are not in the name of any person other than
     AFC-II or the Trustee. AFC-II has not consented to the bank maintaining the
     Bank Accounts to comply with instructions of any person other than the
     Trustee.

          (g)   Other than the security interest granted to the Trustee under
     the Base Indenture and this Supplement, AFC-II has not pledged, assigned,
     sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
     Collateral or the Series 2002-4 Collateral.

<Page>

     AFC-II has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing
     statements against AFC-II that includes a description of collateral
     covering the Collateral other than any financing statement under the Base
     Indenture or that has been terminated. AFC-II is not aware of any judgment
     or tax lien filings against AFC-II.

          (h)   AFC-II has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
     financing statements against AFC-II that include a description of
     collateral covering the Collateral other than any financing statements (i)
     relating to the security interest granted to the Trustee in the Base
     Indenture or (ii) that has been terminated.

          Section 11.18. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee, the Administrative
Agent, any Funding Agent, any CP Conduit Purchaser or any APA Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exhaustive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

          Section 11.19. WAIVER OF SETOFF. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Supplement or any other agreement to the contrary, all payments to the
Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents, the CP Conduit Purchasers and the APA
Banks hereunder shall be made without set-off or counterclaim.
