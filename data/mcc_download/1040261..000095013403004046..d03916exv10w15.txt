                                    "Person" (as the term person is used for
                                    purposes of Section 12(d) or 13(d) of the
                                    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended

                                    immediately after which such Person has

                                    of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
                                    Act) of more than fifty percent (50%) of the

                                    the Company or (2) any corporation or other

                                    indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of
                                    this definition, a "Subsidiary") or (B) the
                                    Company or its Subsidiaries;

                           (ii)     The individuals who, as of the effective
                                    date of the amendment and restatement of the

                                    members of the Board; provided, however,
                                    that if the election,

                                    members of the Board as provided by the

                                    Incumbent Board if such individual initially
                                    assumed office as a result of either an
                                    actual or threatened "Election Contest" (as
                                    described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under
                                    the Exchange Act) or other actual or
                                    threatened solicitation of proxies or
                                    consents by or on behalf of a Person other
                                    than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including
                                    by reason of any agreement intended to avoid
                                    or settle any Election Contest or Proxy
                                    Contest; or

                           (iii)    A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
                                    Company, or

                           (iv)     The sale or other disposition of all or
                                    substantially all of the assets of the
                                    Company to any Person (other than a transfer
                                    to a Subsidiary or a parent in a Non-Control
                                    Acquisition).

                  (f)      COMPANY: PEGASUS SOLUTIONS, INC., a corporation
                           organized and existing under the laws of the State of

                  earned during a Year, on or prior to December 31 of the Year

                           to December 31, 2002 shall be considered for purposes
                           of the Employer Contribution.

                  (d)      Supplemental Contribution: -- For the year 2003, the
                           Employer shall credit each Key Employee with a
                           Supplemental Contribution equal to $10,000 multiplied
                           by the Key Employee's Years of Service determined as
                           of December 31, 2002. For each subsequent Year
                           through and including 2006, the Employer shall credit
                           each Key Employee with a Supplemental Contribution
                           equal to $5,000 multiplied by Years of Service
                           determined as of the end of the preceding Year.

                  (e)      Discretionary Contribution: -- In addition to the
                           contributions described above, the Employer may
                           credit the Discretionary Contribution Account of any
                           one or more Participants with such additional amounts
                           as determined in the sole discretion of the
                           Compensation Committee.

<PAGE>

                  Prior to commencement of Participation hereunder, a Key
                  Employee shall have entered into a Savings Contribution
                  agreement with his Employer. The terms of such agreement shall
                  provide that the Participant agrees to accept a reduction in
                  his Compensation from the Employer equal to any whole
                  percentage. A Participant may defer up to one hundred percent
                  (100%) of Compensation. In consideration of such agreement,
                  the Employer will credit the Key Employee's Savings
                  Contribution Account for each Year with an amount equal to the
                  total amount by which the Key Employee's Compensation from the
                  Employer was reduced during the Year pursuant to the
                  agreement.

                  Savings Contribution agreements shall remain in effect until
                  terminated or amended by the Participant in accordance with
                  the procedures set forth herein. Any amendment or termination
                  of an agreement shall not be effective until January 1
                  following the year in which an election so to amend or
                  terminate is executed by the Participant, provided that such
                  election is made on or prior to December 31. If a Participant
                  terminates his agreement as provided above, then he may elect
                  to enter into another agreement to be effective as of January
                  1 following his execution of a new agreement provided that
                  such election is made on or prior to December 31.

4.03              Disposition of Forfeitures.

                  If, upon a Severance from Service, a Participant is not one
                  hundred percent (100%) vested in his Restoration Contribution
                  Account or his Discretionary Contribution Account, if any,
                  then as of the end of the Year in which his Severance from
                  Service occurs, the forfeitures from such Accounts shall be
                  retained by the Company or used to reduce future contributions
                  under the Plan, if any.

                  investment of his bookkeeping account will be deemed to be
                  made in any one or more of the Funds. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, the Company is under no obligation to acquire or
                  provide any investment funds, and the Plan will be unfunded as

                           in such Funds in accordance with Participant
                           direction.

                           pursuant to Section 4.01(b) hereof shall be credited
                           to the Restoration Contribution Accounts of
                           Participants. A Participant who incurs a Severance
                           from Service during the Year shall receive a pro rata

                  to the credit of the Participant on the books of the Company,

                  Participant in his accounts are to be paid if he dies before
                  payment of all such amounts. Each Beneficiary designation
                  shall be in the form prescribed by the Administrative
                  Committee and will be effective only when filed with the
                  Administrative Committee during the Participant's or former

                  with the Administrative Committee will cancel all Beneficiary
                  designations previously filed with the Administrative
                  Committee.

7.02              No Beneficiary. If any Participant or former Participant fails
                  to designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided above; or if
                  the Beneficiary designated by a Participant or former
                  Participant dies before him and the Participant or former
                  Participant fails to designate a new Beneficiary, or if the
                  Beneficiary designated by a deceased Participant or former
                  Participant dies before complete distribution of the deceased
                  Participant's or former Participant's benefit, the
                  Administrative Committee shall direct that such Participant's
                  or former Participant's accounts be paid as follows, with such
                  payment to be made at the time and in the manner specified in
                  Section 10.02 hereof:

                  (a)      To the surviving spouse of such Participant or former
                           Participant;

                  (b)      To the surviving children, and the descendants of any
                           deceased child, per stirpes, of the Participant or

                  (c)      To the Participant's surviving brothers and sisters;

                           (executor or administrator).

                 HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS AND IN-SERVICE WITHDRAWALS

9.01              Hardship Withdrawals. The Compensation Committee may, in its
                  sole discretion, direct that payment of benefits to a
                  Participant be made, in advance of the date such payments are
                  due hereunder (hereinafter called a "Hardship Withdrawal"), if
                  the Compensation Committee determines that the Participant has
                  an unforeseeable emergency as hereinafter defined. No Hardship
                  Withdrawal shall be in an amount greater than the lesser of
                  (i) the amount needed for the unforeseeable emergency and (ii)
                  the vested balance of the Participant's Accounts on the date
                  of such Hardship Withdrawal. An unforeseeable emergency is
                  defined as set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
                  1.457-2(h)(4), including a severe financial hardship resulting
                  from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the
                  Participant or of a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of
                  the Code), casualty loss, or other similar extraordinary and
                  unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the
                  Participant.

9.02              Involuntary Distributions. Notwithstanding anything contained
                  in the Plan to the contrary, if at any time any Participant is
                  finally determined by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or
                  the Department of Labor ("DOL") not to qualify as a member of
                  a select group of "management or highly compensated employees"
                  as such term is used in ERISA Section 401(a)(1), the
                  Compensation Committee


                                      -13-

                  may, in its sole discretion, immediately distribute in one
                  lump sum to such Participant his vested account under the
                  Plan. A final determination of the IRS or DOL shall be a
                  decision rendered by the IRS or DOL which is no longer subject
                  to administrative appeal within the IRS or DOL.

9.03              Other Withdrawals and Loans. Except as set forth in Sections
                  9.01 and 9.02, no in-service withdrawals or loans are
                  permitted by the Plan.

                               METHODS OF PAYMENT

10.01             Benefit Commencement Date. When a Participant, former
                  Participant or Beneficiary is entitled to receive a payment
                  under Section 6.01 or 6.02, such benefit payment will be made
                  (or will commence to be made) as soon as practicable following
                  death, Disability, Retirement or other Severance from Service.
                  The Participant may, no later than twelve (12) months prior to
                  the event entitling him to a distribution, make an irrevocable
                  election to commence his benefit payment either (a) no later
                  than ninety (90) days following the last day of the month in
                  which death, Disability, Retirement, or other Severance from
                  Service occurred or (b) no later than ninety (90) days
                  following the beginning of the Year following the Year in
                  which death, disability, retirement or other Severance from
                  Service occurred.

10.02             Form of Benefit. Except for hardship withdrawals under Section
                  9.01 or distributions under Section 9.02, the form of payment
                  shall be made in such form as the Participant may elect from
                  the following alternatives:

                  (a)      Single Lump-Sum Payment, under which a single
                           lump-sum payment is made to the Participant, former
                           Participant or his Beneficiary in an amount equal to
                           one hundred percent (100%) of the amount to which he
                           is entitled.

                  (b)      Annuity, under which the Participant's benefit shall
                           be payable as a single life annuity paid monthly
                           during the Participant's lifetime with the last
                           payment to be made for the month in which the
                           Participant's death occurs.

                  (c)      50% or 100% Survivor Annuity, under which monthly
                           payments are made to the Participant during the
                           Participant's lifetime and, if the Participant is
                           survived by a Beneficiary, continuing monthly
                           payments in the amount of fifty percent (50%) or one
                           hundred percent (100%) of the amount payable to the
                           Participant to such Beneficiary for the Beneficiary's
                           lifetime; and

                  (d)      10-Year Certain Annuity, under which monthly payments
                           are made to the Participant or the Participant's
                           Beneficiary for a period of one hundred twenty (120)
                           months, and if the Participant and the Beneficiary
                           die within one hundred twenty (120) months of the
                           date the benefits commenced,


                                      -14-
<PAGE>


                           continuing monthly payments of the same amount to the
                           Participant's estate for the balance of such one
                           hundred twenty (120) month period.

                  Any election pursuant to this Section 10.02 must be made prior
                  to the date on which such Key Employee's participation
                  hereunder first commences, with all payments to be made in the
                  form of a lump sum in the absence of a timely election and,
                  except as expressly provided otherwise in this Plan, shall be
                  irrevocable; provided, however, that a Participant may change
                  such election once during any Year, with the new election to
                  be effective for a distribution arising from a Severance from
                  Service of the Participant only if such distribution is to be
                  made or commence to be made more than twelve (12) months after
                  the date of the new election. The Administrative Committee
                  shall, as of the last day of the calendar quarter within which
                  the Severance from Service occurs, certify to the Trustee or
                  the Corporate Controller of the Employer, as applicable, the
                  method of payment selected by the Participant.

10.03             Company Responsibility. Any payment due to Participants under
                  this Plan and not paid through the Trust, if any, will be
                  payable from the general assets of the Company or the
                  Affiliates.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                             NATURE OF PLAN; FUNDING

11.01             No Trust Required.

                  The adoption of this Plan and any setting aside of amounts by
                  the Employer with which to discharge its obligations hereunder
                  shall not be deemed to create a trust; legal and equitable
                  title to any funds so set aside shall remain in the Employer,
                  and any recipient of benefits hereunder shall have no security
                  or other interest in such funds. Any and all funds so set
                  aside shall remain subject to the claims of the general
                  creditors of the Employer. This provision shall not require
                  the Employer to set aside any funds, but the Employer may set
                  aside such funds if it chooses to do so.

11.02             Funding of Obligation.

                  Section 11.01 above to the contrary notwithstanding, the
                  Employer may elect to transfer assets to the Trust, the
                  provisions of which may require the use of the Trust's assets
                  to satisfy claims of an Employer's general unsecured creditors
                  in the event of such Employer's insolvency and direct that no
                  Participant shall at any time have a prior claim to such
                  assets. The assets of the Trust shall not be deemed to be
                  assets of this Plan.

                                 ADMINISTRATION

12.01             Appointment of Administrative Committee.

                  The Administrative Committee shall administer, construe and
                  interpret the Plan. All usual and reasonable expenses of the
                  Administrative Committee shall be paid by the Employer.
                  Decisions of the Administrative Committee and/or the
                  Compensation Committee with respect to any matter involving
                  the Plan shall be final and binding on the Company, its
                  shareholders, each Employer and all Participants, former
                  Participants, and Beneficiaries. For purposes of ERISA, the
                  Administrative Committee shall be the Plan "administrator"
                  with respect to the general administration of the Plan.

12.02             Duties of Administrative Committee; Chairman and Secretary.

                  The Administrative Committee shall maintain complete and
                  adequate records pertaining to the Plan, including but not
                  limited to Participants' accounts, amounts transferred to the
                  Trust, and all other records, which shall be necessary or
                  desirable in the proper administration of the Plan. The
                  Administrative Committee shall choose from its members a
                  Chairman and may appoint a Secretary to keep such records as
                  may be necessary of the acts and resolutions of the
                  Administrative Committee, and the Secretary so appointed may,
                  but need not, be a member of the Administrative Committee. The
                  Secretary may perform any and all purely ministerial acts,
                  which may be delegated to him in writing by the Administrative
                  Committee. The Administrative Committee may employ such
                  persons or appoint such agents to assist it in the performance
                  of its duties as it may deem appropriate.

12.03             Meetings.

                  Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, any and
                  all acts and decisions of the Administrative Committee shall
                  be by a majority of the members. Any action which might be
                  taken at a meeting of the Administrative Committee may be
                  taken without a meeting if authorized by a writing or writings
                  signed by all of the members of the Administrative Committee,
                  and such action will be effective on the date on which the
                  last signature is placed on such writing or writings, or such
                  earlier or later effective date as is set forth in the writing
                  or writings. The Administrative Committee may delegate to each
                  or any one of its members or to its Secretary authority to
                  sign any documents on its behalf, or to perform ministerial
                  acts, but no person to whom such authority is delegated shall
                  perform any act involving the exercise of any discretion even
                  though he alone may sign any document required by third
                  parties.

12.04             Indemnification of Administrative Committee and Compensation
                  Committee.

                  The Company (the "Indemnifying Party") hereby agrees to
                  indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Administrative
                  Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Secretary, if
                  any (the "Indemnified Parties") against any losses, claims,
                  damages or liabilities to which any of the Indemnified Parties
                  may become subject to the extent that such losses, claims,
                  damages or liabilities or


                                      -16-
<PAGE>


                  actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any
                  act or omission of the Indemnified Party in connection with
                  the administration of this Plan (other than any act or
                  omission of such Indemnified Party constituting gross
                  negligence or willful misconduct), and will reimburse the
                  Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably
                  incurred by him or her in connection with investigating or
                  defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
                  action. Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified Party of
                  notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with
                  respect to any loss, claim, damage or liability against which
                  the Indemnified Party believes he is indemnified, the
                  Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto is to
                  be made against the Indemnifying Party, notify the
                  Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement thereof;
                  provided, however, that the omission so to notify the
                  Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability
                  which it may have to the Indemnified Party to the extent the
                  Indemnifying Party is not prejudiced by such omission. If any
                  such action or proceeding shall be brought against the
                  Indemnified Party, and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party
                  of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be
                  entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it
                  shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
                  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and, after
                  notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of
                  its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying
                  Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any
                  legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
                  Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other
                  than reasonable costs of investigation or reasonable expenses
                  of actions taken at the written request of the Indemnifying
                  Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
                  compromise or settlement of any such action or proceeding
                  effected without its consent, which consent will not be
                  unreasonably withheld.

12.05             Unclaimed Benefits.

                  During the time when a benefit hereunder is payable to any
                  Participant or Beneficiary, the Administrative Committee may,
                  at its own instance, mail by registered or certified mail to
                  such Participant or Beneficiary, at his last known address, a
                  written demand for his then address, or for satisfactory
                  evidence of his continued life, or both. If such information
                  is not furnished to the Administrative Committee within twelve
                  (12) months from the mailing of such demand, then the
                  Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, declare
                  such benefit, or any unpaid portion thereof, suspended, with
                  the result that such unclaimed benefit shall be treated as a
                  forfeiture for the Year within which such twelve (12)-month
                  period ends, but shall be subject to restoration through an
                  Employer credit to its bookkeeping records of the
                  Participant's Accounts if the lost Participant or Beneficiary
                  later files a claim for such benefit.

12.06             Claims Procedure. If any person (hereinafter called the
                  "Claimant") feels that he is being denied a benefit to which
                  he is entitled under this Plan, such Claimant may file a
                  written claim for said benefit with the Administrative
                  Committee. Within ninety (90) days following the receipt of
                  such claim the Administrative Committee shall determine and
                  notify the Claimant as to whether he is entitled to


                                      -17-
<PAGE>


                  such benefit. If an extension of time is required to process
                  the claim, this time period may be extended an additional
                  ninety (90) days. If the claim requires the Administrative
                  Committee to make a determination in the event of Disability,
                  the time period in which the Administrative Committee will
                  review the claim is forty-five (45) days, with two possible
                  extensions of thirty (30) days each. In all cases, the
                  Claimant will be notified in writing of an extension and the
                  reasons for the extension. If the claim is denied, the written
                  notice of denial to the Claimant will include the specific
                  reasons for the denial, references to the provisions of the
                  Plan supporting the denial, a description of any additional
                  information necessary for the claim to be granted, a
                  description of the Plan's claims review procedures, and a
                  statement regarding the Claimant's legal rights to challenge a
                  denial of his or her claim following appeal.

                  If the Claimant still feels that he has a claim, the Claimant
                  may file an appeal with the Administrative Committee in
                  writing within sixty (60) days of receiving the notice of
                  denial. If the Claimant requires the Administrative Committee
                  to make a determination of Disability, the Claimant may file
                  an appeal with the Administrative Committee in writing within
                  one hundred eighty (180) days of receiving the notice of
                  denial. The Claimant may submit documents, records, and other
                  information related to his or her appeal. Upon request, the
                  Claimant may review information relevant to the benefit claim
                  or the Administrative Committee will provide the Claimant with
                  copies of information relevant to the benefit claim without
                  charge. Final determination on the claim will be made no later
                  than sixty (60) days after the Administrative Committee's
                  receipt of the Claimant's written request for an appeal. If
                  additional time is required for processing the Claimant's
                  appeal, this time period may be extended an additional sixty
                  (60) days. If the claim requires the Administrative Committee
                  to make a determination of Disability, a final determination
                  will be made within forty-five (45) days of the Claimant's
                  request for an appeal. If additional time is required for
                  processing the appeal, this time period may be extended an
                  additional forty-five (45) days. In all cases, the Claimant
                  will be notified of an extension and the reasons for the
                  extension. If the Claimant's appeal is denied, the written
                  notice of denial will include the specific reasons for the
                  denial, references to the provisions of the Plan supporting
                  the denial, and a statement regarding the Claimant's legal
                  rights to challenge the denial of the claim. Upon request, the
                  Claimant may review information relevant to the benefit claim
                  or the Administrative Committee will provide the Claimant with
                  copies of information relevant to the benefit claim without
                  charge. The final decision of the Administrative Committee
                  shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties having or
                  claiming to have an interest in the matter being reviewed.
