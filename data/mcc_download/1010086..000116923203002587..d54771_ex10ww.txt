Treatment of Program Income:
Additional Costs


The NIAID is pleased that investigators are submitting investigator-initiated
applications to conduct exciting and important clinical research on the wide
variety of infectious diseases and infectious agents of interest to the Division
of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. The NIAID supports clinical trials and
research through grants, such as the application that you have submitted, as
well as other funding mechanisms. The NIAID also has oversight responsibilities
to ensure compliance with government regulations and facilitate the safety of
participants in these studies. To assist us in this process, any funded
applications for clinical trials will contain within the Notice of Grant Award,
a clear outline of your responsibilities. Acceptance of the competing grant
award, as referenced above, will constitute agreement with these additional
Terms of Award. http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/pdf/clinterm.pdf

Briefly, as a condition of award and before the initiation of any/each planned
clinical study, you are required to submit to your program officer the following
information:
a) A copy of the protocol
b) The proposed informed consent form. You may want to use the model developed
by the NCI (URL:
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/safeguards/consent/template.html)
c) A plan for monitoring the safety of study subjects
d) A plan for serious adverse event reporting, if applicable

Division staff members are available to assist with various aspects of protocol
development, particularly in the areas of informed consent, site monitoring, and
adverse events monitoring methods. We also welcome pre-enrollment meetings to
discuss details of the study.

If we can be of further assistance, please contact your Program Administrator or
your Grants Management Officer, their names are listed below.

PAYMENT INFORMATION: The awardee organization will receive information and forms
from the Payment Management System of the Department of Health and Human
Services regarding requests for cash, manners of payment, and associated
reporting requirements. Payment may be made on a cost-reimbursement or advance
basis. Cost reimbursements may be requested monthly, quarterly, or at other
periodic intervals. Advance payments may be requested on a monthly basis only.
The telephone number for the Payment Management System Office is (301) 443-1660.

The total fixed fee for your Phase II project is $20,436 and is included in the
maximum allowable total costs. This fee is incrementally funded proportionately
for each budget period. $12,505 are allotted for payment of fixed fee for the
budget period covered by this Notice of Grant Award. Additional funds for the
remainder of the total fixed fee are intended to be allotted by a future
Notice(s) of Grant Award, and is reflected in the future year total cost
commitment base on this Notice of Grant Award. Unless and until such future
Notice(s) of Grant Award is (are) issued, the Government will not be obligated
to reimburse the grantee organization for more than the funds currently allotted
for payment of the fixed fee. An adjustment of the fee will be made in the event
the grant is terminated or future support is withheld. The fee allotted under
this Notice of Grant Award is to be drawn down from the BBS Payment System in
increments proportionate to the draw down of funds for costs.

When purchasing equipment or products under this SBIR award, the grantee shall
use only American-made items whenever possible.

Intellectual property rights: Normally, the awardee organization retains the
principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with United States
Government support. Under Title 37 Code of Federal Regulations Part 401, the
Government receives a royalty-free license for its use, reserves the right to
require the patent holder to license others in certain circumstances, and
requires that anyone exclusively licensed to sell the invention in the United
States must normally manufacture it substantially in the United States.

Rights and obligations related to inventions created or reduced to practice as a
result of this award are detailed in 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR Part 401. These
inventions must be reported to the Extramural Invention Reporting and Technology
Resources Branch, OPERA, NIH, 6701 Rockledge Drive, MSC 7750, Bethesda, MD
20892-7750, (301) 435-1986. For additional

(www.iedison.gov) which includes an electronic invention reporting system,
reference information and the text to 37 CFR 401.

To the extent authorized by 35 U.S.C., Section 205, the Government will not make
public any information disclosing an NIH-supported invention for a 4-year period
to allow the awardee organization a reasonable time to file a patent
application, nor will the Government release any information that is part of
that patent application.

Allowable costs conducted by for-profit organizations will be determined by
applying the cost principles of Contracts with Commercial Organizations set
forth in 48 CFR, Subpart 31.2.
