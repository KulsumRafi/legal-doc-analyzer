<p align=center><b>ARTICLE III</b></p>

<p align=center><b><u>PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT AND ESCROW</u></b></p>

<p><b>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase Price
Adjustment.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;Prior to Closing, the Purchase Price may be
adjusted and increased or decreased dollar for dollar based on a usage
adjustment as described in this Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.&nbsp; Customer usage shall be determined based on
the Base Monthly Revenue for each month of the three months immediately
following April 30, 2002.&nbsp; The Base
Monthly Revenue for each of April, May, June and July 2002 will be divided by
the number of Equivalent Business Days (each an &quot;EBD&quot;) set forth on <u>Schedule
3.1</u> in such month to determine the revenue per EBD for each such
month.&nbsp; The revenue per EBD for each of
May, June and July 2002 will be averaged and the average so determined will be
compared with the revenue per EBD in the April 2002 usage period.&nbsp; If the average revenue per EBD for the three
month period is less than 97% or greater than 103% of the revenue per EBD for
the April 2002 usage period, the percentage amount by which the average revenue
per EBD&nbsp; is greater than 103% or is
lower than 97% will be multiplied by the EBD's in the April 2002 usage period
to establish the shortfall or overage revenue amount.&nbsp; This shortfall or overage revenue amount will be the usage
difference and will be multiplied by five times (5X) (the &quot;Positive Usage
Adjustment&quot; or the &quot;Negative Usage Adjustment&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Seller shall not be penalized for
attrition of Customers between May&nbsp;1, 2002 and July 31, 2002 resulting
from actions on the part of the Buyer in the management of the Business during
such period which would be deemed commercially unreasonable or negligent in
accordance with applicable industry standards.&nbsp; An example of the Usage Adjustment calculation is set forth on <u>Schedule
3.1(a)</u>.</p>

<p><b>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase
Price Adjustment Procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On August 15, 2002 (the
&quot;Reconciliation Date&quot;), the Buyer shall cause its accountants to
prepare a schedule (the &quot;Schedule&quot;) showing the amount of the
Positive Usage Adjustment or the Negative Usage Adjustment, as the case may be,
determined as provided in Section 3.1 above. As soon as practicable, but in no
event later than twenty-one (21) days following the Reconciliation Date, Buyer
shall deliver the Schedule to Seller.&nbsp; Seller shall have until fifteen (15) days following receipt of the
Schedule from Buyer, to present in writing to Buyer any objections Seller may
have to the matters set forth therein (&quot;Seller's Objections&quot;), which
objections shall be set forth in reasonable detail.&nbsp; If Buyer does not receive such Seller's Objections on or before
the fifteenth (15) day following the receipt by the Seller of such Schedule,
the Positive Usage Adjustment or the Negative Usage Adjustment, as the case may
be, shall be deemed accepted and approved by Seller.&nbsp; If the Seller delivers Seller's Objections during such fifteen
(15) day period, Buyer's and Seller's respective accounting firms shall attempt
to resolve the matters in dispute and, if resolved, such firms shall send a
joint notice to Buyer and Seller stating the manner in which the dispute was
resolved.&nbsp; If a dispute cannot be
resolved by Buyer and Seller or by their respective accounting firms prior to
forty-five (45) days following the Reconciliation Date, such dispute shall be
submitted to a third accounting firm mutually chosen by the Buyer's and
Seller's accounting firms, which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to such matter or matters.&nbsp; The third accounting firm shall send its written determination to Buyer,
Seller and their respective accounting firms on or before the sixtieth day
following the Reconciliation Date.&nbsp; Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other and each other's
representatives in order that the Positive Usage Adjustment or the Negative
Usage Adjustment, as the case may be, may be timely performed and that any
disputes may be resolved.&nbsp; The fees of
Seller's accounting firm shall be paid by Seller, the fees of Buyer's
accounting firm shall be paid by Buyer and the fee of any third accounting firm
shall be paid one&#8209;half by Buyer and one&#8209;half by Seller.&nbsp; The amount reflected as the Positive Usage
Adjustment or the Negative Usage Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be
referred to herein as the &quot;Reconciliation Amount.&quot;&nbsp; The completion of the procedures set forth
above shall be referred to as the &quot;Reconciliation Procedures.&quot;</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Reconciliation Amount is a positive amount, the
Purchase Price paid to the Seller shall increase on a dollar for dollar basis
for such amount delivered in shares of NUI Common Stock calculated using the
Average Closing Price and, if the Reconciliation Amount reflects a negative
amount, the Purchase Price paid by the Buyer shall be reduced on a dollar for
dollar basis for such amount in shares of NUI Common Stock calculated using the
Average Closing Price.</p>

<p><b>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnity
Escrow.&nbsp; </b>If the Closing has occurred
and shares of NUI Common Stock were placed in the Indemnification Escrow, then
upon the Network One Resolution, the appropriate parties to the Escrow
Agreement shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the shares of NUI Common
Stock held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement attributable to such
event as directed by the Buyer and the Seller.&nbsp; If any Claim for indemnifiable Losses under Section 11.1 or Section 11.2
is pending on the date of distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence and
the aggregate amount of such indemnifiable Losses when settled or paid would
produce an indemnification amount, then the parties shall mutually agree upon
the number of shares of NUI Common Stock to be held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.&nbsp; In the event the parties
shall fail to agree upon the shares of NUI Common Stock to be retained the
dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 11.4 shall be applied to
resolve the foregoing matter or matters.&nbsp; Upon final resolution of all pending Claims which are indemnifiable
Losses under Sections 11.1 and 11.2, and the parties hereto shall direct the
Escrow Agent to release from Escrow the shares of NUI Common Stock retained
based upon a final determination of the foregoing.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulatory Approval
Escrow.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;As a condition to the release of the shares from the Regulatory
Approval Escrow, the Seller and the Buyer shall deliver the compliance
certificates described in Section 9.2 (b) and 9.3(c), respectively, stating
that all representations and warranties are true and correct as of the date of
receipt of the Regulatory Approval and all other obligations have been complied
with as of such date and the Seller shall deliver an opinion of counsel to the
Seller dated as of the date of the related Regulatory Approval, to the effect
that all Regulatory Approvals have been obtained.&nbsp; Following the Closing, upon receipt of Regulatory Approvals for
the number of states which will result in the release from the Regulatory
Approval Escrow of a minimum of 1000 shares of NUI Common Stock and upon the
satisfaction of the conditions in the preceding sentence, the appropriate
parties to the Escrow Agreement shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute the
shares of NUI Common Stock held pursuant to the Regulatory Approval
Escrow.&nbsp; Each release of shares of NUI
Common Stock from the Regulatory Approvals Escrow shall be made in lots of 1000
shares, except for the last release which shall be of the remaining shares.</p>



<p><b>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus Escrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Concurrently with the payment of any
Bonus Payment owed by Seller under the related agent contract listed on
Schedule 8.2(j), Seller shall obtain a full release from each such Agent listed
on Schedule 8.2(j) for the benefit of Seller (each a &quot;Seller's
Release&quot;). Upon presentation of a Seller's Release from an Agent, Buyer
and Seller shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release from the Bonus
Escrow, Escrow Shares having a value based on the Average Closing Price equal
to the amount paid to an Agent in respect of such Release.</p>

<p align=center><b><u>ADDITIONAL
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STOCKHOLDERS OF SELLER</u></b></p>

<p>Each Stockholder and the Seller represents and warrants to
NUI, NUI Telecom and Buyer as follows:</p>

<p><b>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investments
in NUI Common Stock.</b></p>

<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Stockholder (together with such Stockholder's financial
and other advisors, if any) and the Seller has such knowledge and expertise in
financial and business matters that each Stockholder and the Seller is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the acquisition of the NUI Common Stock by
the Seller and by each Stockholder upon distribution thereof by Seller and of
protecting the Stockholder's interests in connection therewith.&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller has the
ability to bear the economic risk of his investment in NUI Common Stock.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller has reviewed copies of NUI's
proxy statement dated December 20, 2001, annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, and will review any additional documents
filed with the SEC provided by NUI.&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller has had an opportunity to discuss NUIs
business, management and financial affairs with NUI's management.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller understands that the shares
of NUI Common Stock to be issued to the Seller and distributed to the
Stockholders in connection with the transaction will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will not be registered or qualified under the securities
or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, except as contemplated by the NUI
Registration Rights Declaration annexed as Exhibit A hereto.&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller further
understands that such shares are being issued to the Seller and distributed to
Stockholders pursuant to exemptions contained in the Securities Act and other
applicable securities and blue sky laws and that NUI's reliance on these
exemptions is based in part on the representations of each Stockholder and the
Seller made herein.&nbsp; Each Stockholder is
acquiring shares of NUI Common Stock from the Seller for his own account and
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof
in violation of any applicable law, and unless the shares have been registered
in accordance with this Agreement and such registration is then in effect, each
Stockholder has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in,
or otherwise distributing the same in violation of any applicable law.&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the Seller understands
that the shares of NUI Common Stock issued in the Transaction will constitute
&quot;restricted securities&quot; within the meaning of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and that, as such, such shares must be held indefinitely unless
they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is
available.&nbsp; Each Stockholder and the
Seller is also aware of the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act
that permit limited resales of shares purchased in a private placement subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the existence of a public
market for the shares, the availability of certain current public information
about NUI, the resale occurring not less than one year after a party has
purchased and paid for the security to be sold, the sale being effected through
a &quot;broker's transaction&quot; or in transactions directly with a
&quot;market maker&quot; (as provided by Rule 144(f) under the Securities Act) and
the number of shares being sold during any three-month period not exceeding
specified limitations.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without in any way limiting the representations set forth
above, each Stockholder further agrees not to make any disposition of all or
any portion of the shares of NUI Common Stock received by such Stockholder as a
result of the Transaction unless and until:</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is then in effect a
registration statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed
disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with such registration
statement; or</p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Stockholder (A) has notified NUI
of the proposed disposition and has furnished NUI with a reasonably detailed
statement of circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition and (B) if
requested by NUI, has furnished NUI with an opinion of counsel, reasonably
satisfactory to NUI, that such disposition will not require registration under
the Securities Act.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is understood that each certificate representing shares
of NUI Common Stock received by the Seller and the Stockholders as a result of
the Transaction will bear a legend substantially to the following effect (in
addition to any legend required under applicable state securities or blue sky
laws):<a name="OLE_LINK1"></a></p>

SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO NUI.&nbsp;
THESE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN
CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH

No Violation.</b></p>
