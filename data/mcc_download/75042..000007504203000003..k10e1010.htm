<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Revolving Credit</U>.  From time to time prior to October 30, 2003 or the earlier termination in full of the Commitments (in either case the "Termination Date"), the Company may obtain loans from each of the Banks ("Revolving Credit Loans"), <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> according to each Bank's Percentage Interest, up to an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount by which (i) $75,000,000 (the "Aggregate Commitment" and as to each Bank's respective Percentage Interest thereof, its "Commitment"), as terminated or reduced pursuant to section&nbsp;1.8, exceeds (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Obligations, (B) the aggregate amount of outstanding Swingline Loans (as defined in section 1.2 below) and (C) the aggregate face amount of outstanding Commercial Paper.  The Commitment and Percentage Interest of each Bank therein is set forth in Appendix A hereto.  The failure of any one or more of the Banks to lend in accordance with its Commitment shall not relieve the other Banks of their several obligations hereunder, but no Bank shall be liable in respect to the obligation of any other Bank hereunder or be obligated in any event to lend in excess of its Commitment.  Subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof the Company may repay such Loans and reborrow hereunder from time to time prior to the Termination Date.  Each Revolving Credit Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 or any multiple of $100,000 in excess of such amount (except that any Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or any multiple of $250,000 in excess of such amount).  Revolving Credit Loans from each Bank shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company (each a "Revolving Credit Note", and collectively with the Swingline Note (as defined in section 1.2 below), sometimes called the "Notes") in the form of <U>Exhibit 1.1</U> annexed hereto, payable to the order of the lending Bank.  Effective on the date of this Agreement, the Commitments of the Banks party to the Credit Agreement dated November 3, 1999, as amended (the "1999 Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the banks party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, formerly known as Firstar Bank, N.A., as agent for such banks, shall automatically terminate without further action on the part of the Company or any of such banks.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Swingline Credit</U>.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Swingline Commitment</U>.  From time to time prior to the Termination Date, the Company may obtain Swingline Loans ("Swingline Loans") from the Agent (in such capacity, the "Swingline Lender") up to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 at any time outstanding, repay such Swingline Loans and reborrow hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Swingline Lender shall not advance any Swingline Loan if (i) any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans would thereby exceed the maximum amount permitted by section 1.1.  Each Swingline Loan shall be in a multiple of $1,000 and the Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a single promissory Note of the Company (the "Swingline Note", and collectively with the Revolving Credit Notes, sometimes called the "Notes") in the form of <U>Exhibit 1.2</U> annexed hereto, payable to the order of the Swingline Lender.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Refunding Revolving Credit Loans</U>.  In its sole and absolute discretion, the Swingline Lender may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf for such purpose), request each Bank to make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Bank's Percentage Interest of the Swingline Loans outstanding on the date such notice is given.  Each Bank shall make the proceeds of its requested Revolving Credit Loan available to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, at the office of the Swingline Lender specified herein before 11:00 a.m. (Milwaukee time) on the Business Day following the day such notice is given.  The proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the outstanding Swingline Loans.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Participations</U>.  If any Bank refuses or otherwise fails to make a Revolving Credit Loan when requested by the Swingline Lender pursuant to section 1.2(b) above, such Bank will, by the time and in the manner such Revolving Credit Loan was to have been funded to the Swingline Lender, purchase from the Swingline Lender an undivided participating interest in the outstanding Swingline Loans in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Credit Loans.  Each Bank that so purchases a participation in a Swingline Loan shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Percentage Interest of each payment of principal received on the Swingline Loan and of interest received thereon accruing from the date such Bank funded to the Swingline Lender its participation in such Swingline Loan.</LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Notes</U>.  The Notes shall be executed by the Company and delivered to the Banks on or prior to the Closing Date.  Although the Notes shall be expressed to be payable in the full amounts specified above, the Company shall be obligated to pay only the amounts actually disbursed to or for the account of the Company, together with interest on the unpaid balance of sums so disbursed which remains outstanding from time to time, at the rates and on the dates specified herein and in the Notes, together with the other amounts provided herein and therein.</LI></P>

Wells Fargo HSBC Trade Bank N.A. (the "Trade Bank") shall acquire a 100% participation interest in each Letter of Credit issued hereunder by HSBC pursuant to a Participation Agreement dated on or about November 1, 2002 between HSBC and the Trade Bank (the "Participation Agreement").

In the event of any drawing on a Letter of Credit which is not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company, each Bank shall pay to the appropriate LOC Bank, a proportionate amount of such drawing equal to its Percentage Interest therein.  Each LOC Bank shall divide the proceeds of any reimbursement of a drawing on a Letter of Credit with the other Banks that have made payment to the LOC Bank pursuant to the foregoing sentence, <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> according to the respective contributions of such other Banks.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Collateral</U>. In the event that any Letter of Credit remains outstanding beyond the Termination Date, the Company shall immediately either (i) pay to the Agent the sum of the outstanding face amount of such Letter of Credit, which sum the Agent may hold for the account of the Company, without interest, for the purpose of paying any draft presented, with the excess, if any, to be returned to the Company upon termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit; (ii) deliver a back-up letter of credit to the Agent securing the Company's reimbursement obligations with respect to such Letter of Credit in form and substance acceptable to the Agent and from a creditworthy financial institution acceptable to the Agent or (iii) pledge collateral with the Agent, of a type and under terms satisfactory to the Agent, with a fair market value equal to or exceeding the outstanding face amount of such Letter of Credit, which collateral the Agent may hold for the account of the Company for the purpose of paying any draft presented, with the excess, if any, to be returned to the Company upon termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit.</LI></P>

<OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Standby Letter of Credit Fees.</U>  The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> benefit of the Banks a letter of credit fee in respect of each standby Letter of Credit at a per annum rate equal to 0.55% on the undrawn face amount of such standby Letter of Credit.  Such fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Fronting Fee</U>.  The Company agrees to pay to the LOC Bank a fronting fee in respect of each standby Letter of Credit at a per annum rate equal to 0.10% on the undrawn face amount of such standby Letter of Credit.  Such fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter. </LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Reliance on Documents</U>.  Delivery to the LOC Banks of any documents complying on their face with the requirements of any Letter of Credit shall be sufficient evidence of the validity, genuineness and sufficiency thereof and of the good faith and proper performance of drawers and users of such Letter of Credit, their agents and assignees; and the LOC Banks may rely thereon without liability or responsibility with respect thereto, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Non-Liability for Other Matters</U>.  The LOC Banks shall not be liable to the Company for (i) honoring any requests for payment under any Letter of Credit which strictly comply on their face with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (ii) any delay in giving or failing to give any notice, (iii) errors, delays, misdeliveries or losses in transmission of telegrams, cables, letters or other communications or documents or items forwarded in connection with any Letter of Credit or any draft, (iv) accepting and relying upon the name, signature or act of any party who is or purports to be acting in strict compliance with the terms of any Letter of Credit; or (v) any other action taken or omitted by the LOC Banks in good faith in connection with any Letter of Credit or any draft; except only that an LOC Bank shall be liable to the Company to the extent of damages suffered by the Company determined by final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (A) the LOC Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or (B) the LOC Bank's willful and wrongful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Obligations Absolute</U>.  The Company's and the other Banks' obligations to reimburse any LOC Bank for a drawing made on a Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Letter of Credit Documents, under any and all circumstances whatsoever; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that payment of such drawing by the LOC Bank shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of such LOC Bank.</LI></P>

<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>HSBC shall provide to Agent, weekly, a report in reasonable detail showing outstanding Letters of Credit issued by HSBC for the account of the Company.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If, upon receipt of the notification from the Company specified in section 1.4(a), the Agent determines that (i) any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) the issuance of a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company would cause the aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans to exceed the maximum amount permitted by section 1.1 or the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit outstanding to exceed the limit provided in section 1.4(a), then the Agent shall so notify each LOC Bank within 24 hours of Agent's receipt of such notification.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The proceeds of the Loans made hereunder will be used solely for the following purposes: repayment at maturity of Commercial Paper (to the extent necessary) and for other general corporate purposes.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No part of the proceeds of any Loan made hereunder will be used to "purchase" or "carry" any "margin stock" or to extend credit to others for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" (as such terms are defined in the Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), and the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries do not include, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any present intention of acquiring, any such security.</LI></P></OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Utilization Fee</U>.  For such periods as the amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans is greater than 50% of the Aggregate Commitment, the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Banks, <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> according to their respective Percentage Interests, a utilization fee computed at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% on the outstanding unpaid principal balance of Revolving Credit Loans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Elective Rates of Interest on Loans</U>.  The unpaid principal balance of the Notes may be comprised of Variable Rate Loans and/or Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans as elected by the Company from time to time in accordance with the procedures set forth below; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that each Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan must be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in increments of $250,000 above that amount; <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that no election of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan shall become effective if any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that no more than ten (10) different Interest Periods for Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans may be outstanding at any one time.  Each notice of election of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan shall be irrevocable.  Swingline Loans shall at all times bear interest at the Variable Rate or, at the Company's election, such other rate quoted to the Company by the Swingline Lender when a Swingline Loan is requested.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Borrowing Procedure</U>.  The Company will request a Loan hereunder by written notice in the form of <U>Exhibit 2.2</U> annexed hereto, or by telephonic notice (which notice shall be confirmed in writing if the Agent so requests), which notices will be irrevocable, to the Agent not later than 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Milwaukee time, on the proposed Borrowing Date, or, in the case of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan, not less than two Business Days before the proposed Borrowing Date.  In the event of any inconsistency between the telephonic notice and the written confirmation thereof, the telephonic notice will control.  Each such request will be effective upon receipt by the Agent and will specify (i) the amount of the requested Loan; (ii) the proposed Borrowing Date; (iii) whether such Loan will bear interest at the Variable Rate or at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate; and (iv) in the case of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan, the Interest Period therefor.  </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon its receipt of such notice from the Company, the Agent shall promptly give notice to the other Banks, each of which shall have its respective portion of the requested Loan available to the Agent in Milwaukee in immediately available funds not later than 2:00&nbsp;p.m., Milwaukee time, on the Borrowing Date.  Out of the funds received from each Bank for the making of the Loans hereunder, the Agent will make a Loan to the Company in such amount on behalf of such Banks.  Notes and other required documents delivered to the Agent for the account of each Bank shall be promptly delivered to such Bank, or in accordance with instructions received from it, together with copies of such other documents received in connection with the borrowing as such Bank shall request.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless the Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed promptly thereafter in writing, by a Bank not later than 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Milwaukee time, on a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> share of a requested Loan, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank, without giving such notice, shall not have so made such amount available to the Agent, such Bank and the Company severally agree to repay the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date the Agent made such amount available to the Company to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Company, the rate applicable to such Loan, and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate for each of the first three days (or fraction thereof) after the date of demand and the Variable Rate for each day (or fraction thereof) thereafter.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Conversion</U>.  The Company may elect from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Notes and this Agreement, to convert all or a portion of a Variable Rate Loan into an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan or to convert all or a portion of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan into a Variable Rate Loan; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that any conversion of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan will occur on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Automatic Conversion</U>.  A Variable Rate Loan will continue as a Variable Rate Loan unless and until converted into an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan.  At the end of the applicable Interest Period for an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan, such Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan will automatically be converted into a Variable Rate Loan unless the Company shall have given the Agent notice in accordance with section 2.5 requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, all or a portion of such Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan be continued as an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan for an additional Interest Period.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Conversion and Continuation Procedure</U>.  The Company will give the Agent written notice in the form of <U>Exhibit 2.5</U> annexed hereto, or telephonic notice (confirmed in writing if the Agent so requests), which notices will be irrevocable, of each conversion of a Variable Rate Loan or continuation of an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan not later than 10:00&nbsp;a.m., Milwaukee time, on a Business Day which is not less than two Business Days before the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying (i) the requested date (which must be a Business Day) of such conversion or continuation; (ii) the amount of the Loan to be converted or continued; (iii) whether such Loan currently bears interest at the Variable Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate; and (iv) the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable thereto.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair</U>.  If with respect to an Interest Period for any Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any Bank determines in good faith (which determination will be binding and conclusive on the Company) that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted LIBOR Rate; or</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>any Bank reasonably determines (which determination will be binding and conclusive on the Company) that the Adjusted LIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of maintaining or funding such Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan for such Interest Period, or that the making or funding of Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans has become impracticable as a result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of such Bank materially affects Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans;</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">then, [a] such Bank will promptly notify the Company thereof, and [b] so long as such circumstances continue, such Bank will not be under any obligation to make any new Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan so affected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><U>Changes in Law Rendering Certain Loans Unlawful</U>.  In the event that any Regulatory Change should make it (or, in the good faith judgment of a Bank, should raise substantial questions as to whether it is) unlawful for such Bank to make, maintain or fund an Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan, (i) such Bank will promptly notify each of the other parties hereto; (ii) the obligation of such Bank to make Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness; and (iii) upon such notice, any outstanding Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan made by such Bank will automatically convert into a Variable Rate Loan to the extent that it is unlawful for such Bank to maintain such outstanding Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loan.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Increased Costs</U>.  If any Regulatory Change,</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>shall subject any Bank to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to any of its Loans or any Letter of Credit hereunder, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank of the principal or interest on its Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder, or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of such Loans, or its obligation to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank);</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>shall impose, modify or make applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any reserve included in the determination of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank; or</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>shall impose on any Bank any other condition affecting its Loans  or Letters of Credit hereunder; </LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to (or in the case of Regulation D or any other analogous law, rule or regulation, to impose a cost on) such Bank of making or maintaining any Loans or issuing Letters of Credit hereunder, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank under this Agreement and any document or instrument related hereto; then upon notice from such Bank (which notice shall be sent to the Agent and the Company and shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such increased cost or other effect on the Loans or Letters of Credit), the Company shall pay directly to such Bank, on demand, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or such reduction. </P>
