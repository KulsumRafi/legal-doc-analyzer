<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting or

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Remedies</B>. Whenever a Default shall exist and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may exercise from time to time any rights and remedies
available to it under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in New York or
otherwise available to it. Without limiting the foregoing, whenever a Default
shall exist and be continuing the Administrative Agent (a)&nbsp;may, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, without notice, advertisement, hearing or
process of law of any kind, (i)&nbsp;sell any or all of the Collateral, free of all
rights and claims of the Pledgors therein and thereto, at any public or private
sale or brokers&#146; board and (ii)&nbsp;bid for and purchase any or all of the

name, place and stead of the Pledgors, to execute endorsements, assignments,
stock powers and other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to
all or any of the Collateral; and (c)&nbsp;may, with respect to the Collateral
consisting of Subsidiary Notes, declare the underlying loans immediately due,
payable and collectible without notice to any Pledgor, regardless of maturity,
and in that event the underlying loans and obligations shall become immediately
due, payable, and collectible; and thereupon the Administrative Agent may then
or at any time thereafter, in addition to the remedies of the Administrative
Agent and Lenders set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
collect from any Pledgor any payments or collections theretofore received by
such Pledgor pursuant to <B>Section&nbsp;5(a)(D) </B>hereof, or sell assign, transfer and
deliver the whole of the Collateral consisting of Subsidiary Notes, or any part
thereof, or additions thereto, or substitutions therefor, in such order as the
Administrative Agent may elect, at public or private sale, at such price or
prices, and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent in its
sole and absolute discretion may determine, without demand, advertisement, or
notice of any kind. Each Pledgor hereby expressly waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any and all notices, advertisements,
hearings or process of law in connection with the exercise by the
Administrative Agent of any of its rights and remedies during the continuance
of a Default. If any notification of intended disposition of any of the
Collateral is required by law, such notification, if mailed, shall be deemed
reasonably and properly given if mailed by certified or registered mail at
least twenty (20)&nbsp;days before such disposition, postage prepaid, addressed to
the Company, either at the address of the Company shown below, or at any other
address of the Company appearing on the records of the Administrative Agent.
Any proceeds of any of the Collateral may be applied by the Administrative
Agent to the payment of expenses in connection with the Collateral, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and legal expenses, and any
balance of such proceeds may be applied by the Administrative Agent toward the
payment of such of the Liabilities, and in such order of application, as the
Administrative Agent may from time to time elect (and, after payment in full of
all Liabilities, any excess shall be delivered to the Company or as a court of
competent jurisdiction shall direct).

limitation or restriction in connection with any sale of Collateral as it may
be advised by counsel is necessary in order to (a)&nbsp;avoid any violation of
applicable law (including, without limitation, compliance with such procedures
as may restrict the number of prospective bidders and purchasers and/or further
restrict such prospective bidders or purchasers to persons or entities who will
represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale of such
Collateral) or (b)&nbsp;obtain any required approval of the sale or of the purchase
by any governmental regulatory authority or official, and each Pledgor agrees

reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if it takes
such action for that purpose as any Pledgor shall request in writing, but
failure of the Administrative Agent to comply with any such request shall not
of itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care, and no failure of
the Administrative Agent to preserve or protect any rights with respect to the
Collateral against prior parties, or to do any act with respect to preservation
of the Collateral not so requested by any Pledgor, shall be deemed of itself a
failure to exercise reasonable care in the custody or preservation of any
Collateral.

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until all obligations

affiliate thereof have terminated. If at any time all or any part of any
payment theretofore applied by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any of
