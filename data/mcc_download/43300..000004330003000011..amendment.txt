                  Business Days the Borrowers could not borrow Loans or have
                  Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement in an

                  at any time thereafter (any such date, a "Trigger Date"), the
                  Collateral Agent may give notice to the applicable collection
                  deposit bank that such collection deposit bank shall no longer
                  permit withdrawals from the Collection Deposit Account to be

                  Date shall contain the same provisions described in the

                  Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement to any
                  person that is not a Grantor, or, upon the effectiveness of
                  any written consent to the release of the security interest
                  granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section 9.02(b)
                  of the Credit Agreement, the security interest in such
                  Collateral shall be automatically released.

         SECTION 2.    Representations and Warranties.  Each of the Borrowers
and other Loan Parties represents and warrants to the Agents and the Lenders
that:

                  (a) This Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by it
                  and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation
                  enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
                  enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
                  moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
                  creditors' rights generally and except as enforceability may
                  be limited by general principles of equity (regardless of
                  whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
                  equity or at law).

                  (b) After giving effect to this Amendment, the representations
                  and warranties set forth in Article III of each of the Credit
                  Agreement and the Security Agreements are true and correct in
                  all material respects with the same effect as if made on the
                  date hereof, except to the extent such representations and
                  warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

                  (c) After giving effect to this Amendment, no Event of
                  Default, or event that with notice or lapse of time or both
                  would constitute an Event of Default, has occurred and is
                  continuing.

                  SECTION 3. Conditions to Effectiveness. This Amendment shall
become effective (as of the date first written above) on the date (the

that executes and delivers a copy of this Amendment to the Agents (or their
counsel) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. on February 21, 2003, an amendment fee in an
amount equal to 0.25% of such Lender's Commitment (whether used or unused), in
each case as of the Amendment Effective Date; provided that the Borrowers shall
have no liability for any such amendment fee if this Amendment does not become
effective pursuant to Section 3. Such amendment fee shall be payable (i) on the
Amendment Effective Date, to each Lender entitled to receive such fee as of the
Amendment Effective Date and (ii) in the case of any Lender that becomes
entitled to such fee after the Amendment Effective Date, within two Business
Days after such Lender becomes entitled to such fee.

                  SECTION 5. Expenses. The Borrowers shall reimburse the Agents
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Amendment, including the reasonable fees and expenses of Cravath, Swaine &
Moore, counsel for the Agents, and McMillan Binch, Canadian counsel for the

                  SECTION 6. Effect of Amendment. Except as expressly set forth
herein, this Amendment shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair,
constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the
Agents or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement or the Security Agreements, and
shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect the terms, conditions,
obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or either
Security Agreement, all of which are ratified and affirmed in all respects and
shall continue in full force and effect. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
entitle the Borrowers to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or
other change of, any terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements
contained in the Credit Agreement or either Security Agreement in similar or
different circumstances. This Amendment shall apply and be effective only with
respect to the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreements
specifically referred to herein.

                  SECTION 7. Credit Agreement and Security Agreements. Except as
specifically amended hereby, the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreements
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the provisions
thereof as in existence on the date hereof. After the date hereof, any reference
to the Credit Agreement shall mean the Credit Agreement as amended hereby and
any reference to either of the Security Agreements shall mean such Security
Agreement as amended hereby. This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document for
all purposes under the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.  Applicable Law.  THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  SECTION 9. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken together shall constitute but one contract. Delivery of an
executed signature page of this Amendment by facsimile transmission shall be

                  SECTION 10. Headings. The Section headings used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Amendment and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Amendment.
