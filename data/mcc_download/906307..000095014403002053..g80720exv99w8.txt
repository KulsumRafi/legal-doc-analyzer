NUTRITIONAL SOURCING CORPORATION
LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION

This Liquidation Analysis (the "Analysis") is based upon NSC's preliminary
balance sheet (unaudited) as of November 2, 2002.

The Company's management, with the assistance of Alvarez & Marsal, Inc., has
prepared the Analysis. The Analysis presents the Company's current estimated net
value of its assets, if it were to be liquidated under the provisions of Chapter
7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the net proceeds of the liquidation
were to be distributed to the Company's creditors. The Company reserves the
right to periodically update or modify the estimates set forth herein.

The Analysis has not been examined or reviewed by independent accountants in
accordance with the standards promulgated by the AICPA. The estimates and
assumptions, although considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of the
Company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the results shown would be
realized if the Company was liquidated. Actual results in such case could vary
materially from those presented.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS

NSC is a holding company and, as such, has no operations and no employees of its
own. It is managements' view that the liquidation of NSC would quickly lead to
the sale or liquidation of its Pueblo and PEI, the operators of the Pueblo
supermarkets and the video rental business, respectively. Substantially all of
NSC's assets are comprised of notes receivable from its subsidiaries and its
investment in its subsidiaries. The notes receivable are secured by a
subordinated security interest in certain of the Operating Subsidiaries' owned
and leased real estate, stores and distribution center.

For purposes of this liquidation analysis, management has assumed that Lender's
claims will be satisfied in full from the cash balances and the proceeds of the
liquidation of the inventories at Pueblo. Therefore, management believes it is
unlikely that the Lender will be required to seek payment from NSC on account of
its guarantee of the Existing Bank Facility.

Management has further assumed that, after the Lender is paid in full, NSC will
recover a substantial amount on account of its security interest in its
Operating Subsidiaries' fixed assets. Management estimates, however, that the
NSC's claim is undersecured and that it will have a large deficiency claim in
any the liquidation of Pueblo, as shown in footnote B to the liquidation
analysis that follows.

THE ATTACHED INTRODUCTION, KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF
THIS ANALYSIS.


Notes

        A - NSC is a holding company and its only source of cash is debt
            repayments from its Operating Subsidiaries. NSC will have to obtain
            an advance from its Operating Subsidiaries or obtain debtor in
            possession financing to pay for the costs of liquidation.

        B - The notes receivable are due to NSC from its Operating
            Subsidiaries and arose at the time of issuance of the Senior Notes.
            These notes are shown net of an $11.6 million account payable due to
            the Operating Subsidiaries. One note is in the amount of $125.0
            million and is secured by certain liens on the property, plant and
            equipment and furniture and fixtures of Pueblo. The other notes and
            the accrued interest due from the Operating Subsidiaries total $37.0
            million. For purposes of this liquidation analysis management
            estimates that the properties for which appraisals are available
            would yield a liquidation amount of between 60%-70% of appraised
            value in a forced liquidation. For other fixed assets, principally
            furniture, fixtures and equipment, management estimated the values
            based on its experience selling the contents of stores that have
            been closed. Leasehold improvements

                                       2
<PAGE>

            are expected to be worthless in liquidation, because they become the
            property of the landlord. The value of favorable leases is based on
            management's best estimate of the amount that could be achieved
            given the current market conditions in Puerto Rico and their
            knowledge of the local real estate market. Given the relatively
            small amount of the fixed assets of the video rental business, which
            is assumed to be sold as a going concern in this Analysis,
            management believes that the estimated proceeds shown below have
            been adequately reduced to take this into account. Management also
            believes that the capitalized leases will have no value in
            liquidation.

            The net liquidation value of the fixed assets is expected to be less
            than the amount of the subordinated secured note, leaving a
            deficiency claim in the liquidation of the Operating Subsidiaries.
            NSC will have an unsecured claim in the liquidation of the Operating
            Subsidiaries consisting of that deficiency claim plus the amount of
            its unsecured notes and accrued interest.

            A summary of these assumptions is set forth below:

</TABLE>

            Based on the above estimates, management has determined to use the
            mid-point between the high and low Range of Estimated Recoveries
            shown above as the most likely assumption of the amount by which the
            the Accounts Receivable - Intercompany would be reduced to determine
            the deficiency claim to which NSC would be entitled in the
            hypothetical liquidation of its Operating Subsidiaries as shown
            below:
                                                        Range of Estimated
                                                            Recoveries
                                                            ----------
                       Low Proceeds                           $43,709
                       High Proceeds                           54,535
                                                         ------------
                          Subtotal                            $98,244
                                                       divided by 2 =
                       Mid-point                              $49,122

            Therefore the deficiency claim of NSC is estimated to be the
            difference between the balance of the Accounts Receivable -
            Intercompany and the Mid-point shown above:

            Management estimates that the net recovery to the unsecured
            creditors in a Pueblo bankruptcy would be in the range of 10-20% of
            the allowed claims. As a result, for purposes of this Analysis,
            management has assumed the total estimated recovery to NSC on
            account of the Accounts Receivable - Intercompany is the sum of the
            Mid-point of the range of the Estimated Range of Recoveries on NSC's
            secured claim and the range of estimated recoveries on account of
            its unsecured claim:

        C - Prepaid Expenses consist primarily of retainers paid to the
            Company's outside restructuring professionals and is expected to be
            depleted by the end of a liquidation.

        D - Investment in Subsidiaries represents the Company's cumulative
            book value of its investment in its subsidiaries. Management
            believes with the exception of PEI its other Operating Subsidiaries
            would be insolvent in liquidation. The value of PEI is estimated to
            be $20-25 million based upon a confidential and informal indication
            of interest received by the Company.

        E - Deferred Tax Assets are only available to be used against future
            taxable income, therefore they would have no value in liquidation.

        F - Other Assets represent deferred bond issuance costs that are
            expected by management to have no value in a liquidation.

        G - Administrative Claims have been estimated by management to include
            $100,000 per month for six months, representing NSC's share of the
            cost of salaries, benefits and overhead provided by its Operating
            Subsidiaries. In addition, the professional fees that would be due
            to NSC's professionals are estimated to amount to $3.5 million based
            upon the estimated time frames, billing rates and amounts already
            billed.

        H - The unsecured claims at the NSC level consist of amounts owing on
            account of the Senior Notes. The Senior Note holders would receive a
            distribution in the amount that NSC receives on account of its
            claims in the sale or liquidation of its Operating Subsidiaries
            after deducting NSC's liquidation expenses and any cash advances or
            debtor in possession financing provided to NSC.
