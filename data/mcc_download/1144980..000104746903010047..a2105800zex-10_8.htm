<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
agreement is entered into as of September&nbsp;23, 2002 between Asbury Automotive Group, L.L.C. ("Asbury") and Lynne A. Burgess ("Executive"), a key employee of Asbury, in order to provide for
an agreed-upon compensation in the event that Executive's employment is terminated as defined in this agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severance Pay Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
a "Termination" (as defined in Section&nbsp;2 below) of Executive's employment occurs at any time during Executive's employment, Asbury will pay Executive 12&nbsp;months of Executive's base
salary as of the date of Termination as "Severance Pay." Payment (subject to required withholding) of the Severance Pay will be made by Asbury to Executive on the regular payroll dates of Asbury
starting with the date of Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
Executive participates in a bonus compensation plan at the date of Termination, Severance Pay will also include a portion of the target bonus for the year of Termination in an amount equal to the
target bonus multiplied by the percentage of such year that has expired through the date of Termination. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition, Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution in any health, dental, disability and life insurance plans, as may be
amended from time to time, in which Executive was participating immediately prior to the date of Termination. Such participation will terminate upon the earlier of: (A)&nbsp;30&nbsp;days after
Executive has obtained other employment under which Executive is covered by equal benefits; and (B)&nbsp;12&nbsp;months following the date of Termination. Executive agrees to notify Asbury
promptly upon obtaining such other employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Upon
expiration of the 12&nbsp;month period referenced in this Section&nbsp;1, Executive, at his or her option, may elect to obtain COBRA coverage in accordance with the terms and conditions of
applicable law and Asbury's standard policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Termination Triggering Severance Pay  </B></FONT></P>

<UL>

voluntary resignation or "cause"; or (2)&nbsp;termination by Executive because of mandatory relocation of Executive's current principal place of business to a location more than 50 miles away; or
(3)&nbsp;The imposition by Asbury of a reduction of Executive's base salary without his or her consent; or (4)&nbsp;any material diminution of Executive's duties or job title, except in the case
of a termination for "cause," death, "disability," retirement or voluntary resignation. The definition of "disability" is a physical or mental disability or infirmity that prevents the performance by
Executive of his or her duties lasting (or likely to last, based on competent medical evidence presented to Asbury) for a continuous period of six months or longer. The definition of "cause" is:
(A)&nbsp;Executive's gross negligence or serious misconduct (including, without limitation, any criminal, fraudulent or dishonest conduct) that is or may be injurious to Asbury or any of its
