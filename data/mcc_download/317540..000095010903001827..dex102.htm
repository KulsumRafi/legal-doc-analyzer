if in the reasonable opinion of the Company, there are three or more manufacturers who are capable of producing such items to be fully suitable for the purpose intended and in accordance with the high quality standards and image of excellence of the

the Bottler are suitable for the purpose intended, and in accordance with the good reputation and image of excellence of the Trademarks and Beverages.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in;

outside the Territory. If any Beverage distributed by the Bottler is found outside of the Territory, Bottler shall be deemed to have transshipped such Beverage and shall be deemed to be a &#147;Transshipping Bottler&#148; for purposes hereof;

amount not to exceed three times the Offended Bottler&#146;s most current average gross margin per case of the Beverage transshipped, as reasonably estimated by the Company. If the Offended Bottler does not sell the Beverage that has been
transshipped, the Company may make the foregoing estimate on the basis of what it considers a comparable product. The Company and the Bottler agree that the amount of such charge shall be deemed to reflect the damages to the Company, the Offended
Bottler and the bottling system. The Company shall forward to the Offended Bottler, upon receipt from the Transshipping Bottler, not less than an amount per case which approximates the Offended Bottler&#146;s most current average gross margin per
