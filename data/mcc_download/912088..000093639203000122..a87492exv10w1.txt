                                   The Credits

         SECTION 2.01.     Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender
agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower, at
any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, and until the earlier of
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitment of such
Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at
any time outstanding that will not result in such Lender's Revolving Credit
Exposure exceeding such Lender's Commitment. As of the date hereof and until
such time as Administrative Agent has notified Borrower that it has obtained
additional Commitments of $10.0 million, the Total Commitment shall not exceed
$90.0 million less any reductions required or permitted by Section 2.09 or 2.12;
thereafter, the Total Commitment shall not exceed $100.0 million less any
reductions required or permitted by Section 2.09 or 2.12. Within the limits set
forth in the preceding sentences and subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and
reborrow Revolving Loans.

         SECTION 2.02.     Revolving Loans.

                  (a)      Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a
Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with their applicable Commitments; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan shall not in itself relieve any
other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however,
that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
any Revolving Loan required to be made by such other Lender). Except for Loans
deemed made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), (x) the ABR Loans comprising any
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $100,000 or (ii) equal to the remaining
available balance of the applicable Commitments and (y) the Eurodollar Loans
comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i)
an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $500,000 or (ii) equal to the
remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.

                  (b)      Subject to Sections 2.08 and 2.14, each Borrowing
shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may
request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Revolving Loan; provided that any exercise of such option
shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Revolving Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type
may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower shall
not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more
than twenty-five (25) Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any time.
For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods,
regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered
separate Borrowings.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Except with respect to Revolving Loans made pursuant
to Section 2.02(f), each Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account in California as the Administrative Agent may designate
not later than 12:00 noon, California time, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly credit the amounts so received to an account as directed by the
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request maintained with the Administrative
Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition
precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so
received to the respective Lenders.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with paragraph (c) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds
available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith, in the case of such
Lender, on demand, and, in the case of the Borrower, within two Business Days of
demand, such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such
amount shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan as part of such Borrowing
for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

                  (f)      If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from the
Borrower the payment required to be made by Section 2.21(e) within the time
specified in such Section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the
Administrative Agent of the L/C Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of such L/C Disbursement and its Pro Rata Percentage
thereof. Each Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the Administrative Agent on such date (or, if such Lender shall have received
such notice later than 12:00 (noon), California time, on any day, not later than
11:00 a.m., California time, on the immediately following Business Day), an
amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement (it
being understood that such amount shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Loan of
such Lender, and such payment shall be deemed to have reduced the L/C Exposure),
and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so
received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to
the Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.21(e) prior to the time that any Lender makes any payment pursuant to
this paragraph (f); any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent
thereafter will be

                                       28

<PAGE>

promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have
made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. If
any Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement
available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, such Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for each day from and
including the date such amount is required to be paid in accordance with this
paragraph (f) to, but excluding, the date such amount is paid, to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of
the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to
Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and (ii) in the case of such
Lender, for the first such day, the Federal Funds Rate, and for each day
thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.

         SECTION 2.03.     Borrowing Procedure. In order to request a Borrowing
(other than a deemed Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(f), as to which this
Section 2.03 shall not apply), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to
the Administrative Agent a duly completed Borrowing Request (a) in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 9:00 a.m., California time, at least three
Business Days before a proposed Borrowing, and (b) in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., California time, one Business Day before a
proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable, shall be signed
by or on behalf of the Borrower and shall specify the following information: (i)
whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
provided that until the Arranger shall have notified the Borrower that the
primary syndication of the Commitments has been completed (which notice shall be
given as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 180 days after the
Closing Date), the Borrower shall only be permitted to request (x) ABR
Borrowings or (y) Eurodollar Borrowings with an Interest Period of seven days,
unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent; (ii) the date of such
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the number and location of the
account to which funds are to be disbursed (which shall be an account that
complies with the requirements of Section 2.02(c)); (iv) the amount of such
Borrowing; and (v) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period with respect thereto; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
any contrary specification in any Borrowing Request, each requested Borrowing
shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 2.02. If no election as
to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration, except as
set forth above. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the applicable
Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03 (and the contents
thereof) and of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.04.     Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Revolving Loans.

                  (a)      The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan made by such Lender
from time to time, including the amounts of

                                       29

<PAGE>

principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under
this Agreement.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
which it will record (i) the amount of each Revolving Loan made hereunder, the
Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower or any Guarantor and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant
to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower
to repay the Revolving Loans in accordance with their terms.

                  (e)      The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by the
Revolving Notes payable to each Lender and its registered assigns and in a form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the interests
represented by such Revolving Notes shall at all times (including after any
assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 9.04) be
represented by one or more Revolving Notes payable to the payee named therein or
its registered assigns, until such Revolving Note is returned to the Borrower
and duly canceled or other arrangements are made to the satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 2.05.     Fees.

                  (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender, through
the Administrative Agent, on the last Business Day of March, June, September and
December in each year and on each date on which any Commitment of such Lender
shall expire or be terminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a
"Commitment Fee") equal to the Applicable Revolving Commitment Fee Percentage
per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Commitments (which
calculations shall not take into account L/C Exposure relating to Commercial
Letters of Credit) of such Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period
commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date or the date on which the Commitments of such Lender shall expire or be
terminated). All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to each
Lender shall commence to accrue on the date hereof and shall cease to accrue on
the date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated as
provided herein.

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for its own account, such fees as set forth in the Fee Letter (the
"Administrative Agent Fees").

                  (c)      With respect to each Letter of Credit, the Borrower
agrees to pay: (i) to the Issuing Bank with respect to each Letter of Credit,
concurrently with the issuance of each

                                       30

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit and annually thereafter, a fronting fee equal to 0.125% per
annum on the aggregate outstanding face amount of such Letter of Credit (the
"Issuing Bank Fees"); (ii) quarterly in advance, to the Administrative Agent for
the ratable account of the Lenders in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata
Percentage of the aggregate L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), a standby letter of credit fee
(the "L/C Participation Fee") in an amount equal to (A) the Applicable
Percentage per annum in effect at the time of issuance of such Standby Letter of
Credit used to determine the interest rate on Revolving Credit Borrowings
comprised of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 times (B) the face amount
of such Standby Letter of Credit through the termination or expiration of such
Standby Letter of Credit, which fee the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to the Lenders; (iii) concurrently with the issuance of each Commercial Letter
of Credit, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders in
accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate L/C Exposure
(excluding the portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements),
a commercial letter of credit issuance fee in the amount set forth from time to
time as the Issuing Bank's published scheduled fee for the issuance of
commercial letters of credit, which fee the Administrative Agent shall promptly
pay to the Lenders; and (iv) and concurrently with each negotiation, drawing or
amendment of each Commercial Letter of Credit, to the Issuing Bank for the sole
account of the Issuing Bank, negotiation, drawing and amendment fees in the
amounts set forth from time to time as the Issuing Bank's published scheduled
fees for such services.

                  (d)      All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if
and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that the Issuing Bank Fees and any
fees incurred pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iv) shall be paid directly to the
Issuing Bank. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any
circumstances.

         SECTION 2.06.     Interest on Revolving Loans.

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the
Revolving Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus
the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the
Revolving Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days) at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period
in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Percentage in effect from time
to time.

                  (c)      Interest on each Revolving Loan shall be payable on
the Interest Payment Dates applicable to such Revolving Loan except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement. The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Eurodollar
Rate for each Interest Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may
be, shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                                       31

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.07.     Default Interest. Upon and during the continuance of
any Event of Default, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time pay
interest, to the extent permitted by law, on the Revolving Loans and any other
amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document at the higher of (a) a
rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be) equal to the rate that would be
applicable to an ABR Loan plus 2.00% and (b) the rate otherwise applicable to a
Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.06 plus 2.00% per annum.

         SECTION 2.08.     Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
reasonably determined that quotations for interest rates for the relevant
deposits referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate" are not being
provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining rates of interest for Eurodollar Loans as provided herein, or that
the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining its
Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such
determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such
determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.03 or 2.10 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

         SECTION 2.09.     Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

                  (a)      The Commitments and the L/C Commitment shall
automatically terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

                  (b)      The Total Commitment shall automatically reduce by
$10.0 million on each anniversary of the Closing Date.

                  (c)      Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable
written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any
time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently
reduce, the Commitments; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of
the Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1.0 million and in a
minimum amount of $5.0 million, and (ii) the Total Commitment shall not be so
reduced to an amount that is less than the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure
at the time.

                  (d)      Each reduction in the Commitments hereunder shall be
made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable
Commitments. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the applicable Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction, the
Commitment Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced
accrued to but excluding the date of such termination or reduction.

                                       32

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.10.     Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings. The
Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent (a) not later than 10:00 a.m., California time, one
Business Day prior to conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an
ABR Borrowing, (b) not later than 9:00 a.m., California time, three Business
Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a
Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar
Borrowing for an additional Interest Period, and (c) not later than 9:00 a.m.,
California time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the
Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible
Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

                  (i)      each conversion or continuation shall be made pro
         rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal
         amounts of the Revolving Loans comprising the converted or continued
         Borrowing;

                  (ii)     if less than all the outstanding principal amount of
         any Borrowing shall be converted or continued, then each resulting
         Borrowing shall satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(a)
         and 2.02(b) regarding the principal amount and maximum number of
         Borrowings of the relevant Type;

                  (iii)    each conversion shall be effected by each Lender and
         the Administrative Agent by recording for the account of such Lender
         the new Revolving Loan of such Lender resulting from such conversion
         and reducing the Revolving Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender
         being converted by an equivalent principal amount; accrued interest on
         any Eurodollar Loan (or portion thereof) being converted shall be paid
         by the Borrower at the time of conversion;

                  (iv)     if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted at a time
         other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the
         Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders
         pursuant to Section 2.15;

                  (v)      any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required to be
         repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as
         a Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (vi)     any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing that cannot be
         converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of the
         immediately preceding clause shall be automatically converted at the
         end of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR
         Borrowing;

                  (vii)    upon notice to the Borrower from the Administrative
         Agent given at the request of the Required Lenders (A) after the
         occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, Revolving Loans may
         only be converted into, or continued as, (x) ABR Loans or (y)
         Eurodollar Loans with an Interest Period of one month or less and (B)
         after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
         no outstanding Revolving Loan may be converted into, or continued as, a
         Eurodollar Loan; and

                                       33

<PAGE>

                  (viii)   until the Administrative Agent shall have notified
         the Borrower that the primary syndication of the Commitments has been
         completed (which notice shall be given by the Arranger as promptly as
         practicable and, in any event, within 180 days after the Closing Date),
         an ABR Borrowing may be converted only into a Eurodollar Borrowing with
         an Interest Period of seven days, unless otherwise agreed to by the
         Administrative Agent.

         Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and
shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of the
Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or continued; (ii) whether
such Borrowing is to be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or
an ABR Borrowing; (iii) if such notice requests a conversion, the date of such
conversion (which shall be a Business Day); and (iv) if such Borrowing is to be
converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice with
respect to any conversion into or continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lender's portion of any converted or
continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance
with this Section 2.10 to continue any Borrowing into a subsequent Interest
Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with this
Section 2.10 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing shall, at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof),
automatically be continued into a new Interest Period as an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.11.     Optional Prepayments.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall have the right at any time and
from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, (i) upon at
least three Business Days' prior written or telecopy notice in the case of
Eurodollar Loans or (ii) or upon at least one Business Day's prior written or
telecopy notice in the case of ABR Loans, to the Administrative Agent before
9:00 a.m., California time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$100,000.

                  (b)      Each notice of prepayment shall specify the
prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof)
to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such
Borrowing by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. All
prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall be subject to Section 2.15 but shall
be otherwise without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this Section 2.11
shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid
to the date of payment.

         SECTION 2.12.     Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (a)      In the event of any termination of all the
Commitments as provided in this Agreement, the Borrower shall, on the date of
such termination, repay or prepay all its outstanding Revolving Credit
Borrowings and replace all outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an
amount equal to the L/C Exposure in cash in a cash collateral account
established

                                       34

<PAGE>

with the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties. In the event
of any partial or mandatory reduction of the Commitments or, if applicable
pursuant to Section 2.23, the Borrowing Base (including as evidenced by the most
recently delivered Borrowing Base Certificate) then (i) at or prior to the
effective date of such reduction, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure after giving
effect thereto and (ii) if the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed
the Total Commitment after giving effect to such reduction or termination, or
(iii) if the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the lesser of the
Total Commitment and, if applicable, pursuant to Section 2.23, the Borrowing
Base, in each case after giving effect to such reduction or termination, then
the Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction or termination, repay or
prepay Revolving Credit Borrowings to the then-required amount and/or replace or
cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient to
eliminate such excess.

                  (b)      Not later than one Business Day following the receipt
of any Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Revolving Loans shall be repaid
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in an aggregate amount equal
to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received with respect to such Asset Sale.

                  (c)      Not later than one Business Day following the receipt
of any Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event, the Revolving Loans shall be
repaid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in an aggregate
amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Casualty Event.

                  (d)      The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent, at the time of each prepayment required under this Section 2.12, (i) a
certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such prepayment and (ii) to
the extent practicable, at least three days' prior written notice of such
prepayment. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the
Type of each Loan being prepaid and the principal amount of each Loan (or
portion thereof) to be prepaid. All prepayments of Borrowings under this Section
2.12 shall be subject to Section 2.15, but shall otherwise be without premium or
penalty.

                  (e)      Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.12
to the prepayment of Revolving Loans shall be applied first to reduce
outstanding ABR Loans. Any amounts remaining after each such application shall
be applied to prepay Eurodollar Loans provided that if a prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan pursuant to subparagraphs (b) and (c), above, would create a
Breakage Event, Administrative Agent shall hold such Net Cash Proceeds in an
interest-bearing account for the benefit of Borrower and shall cause such
prepayment on the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan.

         SECTION 2.13.     Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if after the Closing Date any change in applicable law or regulation
or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having
the force of law) shall impose, modify or deem

                                       35

<PAGE>

applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by any Lender or the
Issuing Bank (except any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the
Eurodollar Rate) or shall impose on such Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
therein, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
such Lender or the Issuing Bank of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or
increase the cost to any Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
or purchasing or maintaining a participation therein or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender
or the Issuing Bank to be material, then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, within 10 days after demand such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b)      If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have
determined that the adoption after the Closing Date of any law, rule,
regulation, agreement or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change
after the date hereof in any such law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline
(whether such law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline has been adopted) or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or the Issuing Bank or any
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any
Governmental Authority has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Revolving Loans made or participations in Letters of Credit
purchased by such Lender pursuant hereto or the Letters of Credit issued by the
Issuing Bank pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have
achieved but for such applicability, adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material,
then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank,
setting forth in reasonable detail the reason therefor, the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company,
as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, and the calculation
thereof, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank the
amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 days after
its receipt of the same.

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in
amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing

                                       36

<PAGE>

Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not
be under any obligation to compensate any Lender or the Issuing Bank under
paragraph (a) or (b) above with respect to increased costs or reductions with
respect to any period prior to the date that is 270 days prior to such request
if such Lender or the Issuing Bank knew or could reasonably have been expected
to be aware of the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions and of the fact that such circumstances would in fact result in a
claim for increased compensation by reason of such increased costs or
reductions; provided, further, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
any increased costs or reductions arising out of the retroactive application of
any law, regulation, rule, guideline or directive as aforesaid within such
six-month period. Each Lender's determination and calculation of amounts due it
under this Section 2.13 shall be binding on all parties hereto absent manifest
error.

         SECTION 2.14.     Change in Legality.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in
the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice
to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:

                           (i)      such Lender may declare that Eurodollar
         Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be
         made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest
         Periods and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be
         converted into Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a
         Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar
         Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional
         Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for
         an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an
         additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR
         Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be
         subsequently withdrawn; and

                           (ii)     such Lender may require that all outstanding
         Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted into ABR Loans, in which event
         all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted into ABR
         Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph
         (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.

                  (b)      For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the
Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by
such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently
applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be
effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

                                       37

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.15.     Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the
performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender
receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of
any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor;
(ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of
the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case other than
on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor; or (iii) any
Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be
made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made
after notice of such Revolving Loan shall have been given by the Borrower
hereunder (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a
"Breakage Event") or (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment
required to be made hereunder. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss
shall include an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such
Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Loan that is the
subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage
Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been
in effect) for such Revolving Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be
realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by
reason of such Breakage Event for such period (excluding any Applicable
Percentage). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts
which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.16.     Pro Rata Treatment. Except as provided below in this
Section 2.16 and as required under Sections 2.12(c) and 2.14, each Borrowing,
each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of
interest on the Revolving Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each
reduction of the Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or
continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro
rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable
Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving
Loans). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any
Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion,
round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower
whole dollar amount.

         SECTION 2.17.     Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or pursuant to a secured claim
under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or
interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in
respect of any Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement as a result of which the
unpaid principal portion of its Revolving Loans and participations in L/C
Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of
the Revolving Loans and participations in L/C Disbursement of any other Lender,
it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at
face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for,
a participation in the Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure, as the case may be, of
such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Revolving Loans and L/C

                                       38

<PAGE>

Exposure and participations in Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure held by each
Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of all Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure then outstanding as the principal amount
of its Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure prior to such exercise of banker's lien,
setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all
Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's
lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that if any such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17
and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase
or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery
and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The
Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any
Lender holding a participation in a Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement deemed to
have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff
or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such
Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Revolving Loan
directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

         SECTION 2.18.     Payments.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall make each payment (including
principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees or
other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 11:00
a.m., California time, on the date when due in immediately available dollars,
without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Each such payment (other than Issuing
Bank Fees and any fees incurred pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iv), which shall be
paid directly to the Issuing Bank) shall be made to the Administrative Agent at
its address for notices set forth in Section 9.01 of this Agreement, or such
other address that the Administrative Agent may designate in writing to the
Borrower.

                  (b)      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any
Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become
due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment
may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time
shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if
applicable.

                  (c)      The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to debit the Designated Deposit Account to effect any payment due to the
Lenders or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement provided
Administrative Agent has given Borrower prior notice of the amount and timing of
such debit. Any resulting overdraft in such account shall be payable by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent on the next succeeding Business Day.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment to be made by
the Borrower hereunder is due that the Borrower does not intend to remit such
payment, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, assume that Borrower
has remitted such payment when so due and the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each Lender
on such payment date an amount equal to such Lender's share of

                                       39

<PAGE>

such assumed payment. If the Borrower has not in fact remitted such payment to
the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the
Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such
Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including
the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such
Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the
Federal Funds Rate.

         SECTION 2.19.     Taxes.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or any Loan
Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.19) the Administrative Agent or such Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Borrower or such Loan Party shall
make such deductions; and (iii) the Borrower or such Loan Party shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, within five days after written demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under
any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.19) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment
or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

                  (e)      Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party,
with respect to payments under this Agreement

                                       40

<PAGE>

shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
reduced rate.

                  (f)      If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a
refund in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower,
which in the good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender is
allocable to such payment, it shall promptly pay such refund, but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made or additional amounts paid by the Borrower
under this Section 2.13 with respect to Taxes and Other Taxes, to the Borrower,
net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes to which such
Lender has become subject as a result of its receipt of such refund) of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the Borrower
agrees to promptly return such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative
Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, if it receives notice from
the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender that the Administrative Agent
or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.19(f) shall require the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes which it deems to be confidential) to the Borrower or any
other person.

         SECTION 2.20.     Assignment of Commitments Under Certain
Circumstances; Duty to Mitigate.

                  (a)      In the event (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank
delivers a certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.13; (ii)
any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a notice described in Section 2.14; or
(iii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or the
Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.19 the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee referred to
in Section 9.04(b)), upon notice to such Lender or the Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender or the Issuing Bank to transfer and
assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such assigned obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided
that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or
order of any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, (y) the
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, of the Issuing Bank), which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, and (z) the Borrower or
such assignee shall have paid to the affected Lender or the Issuing Bank in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and
interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding Revolving Loans
or L/C Disbursements of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, respectively, plus all
Fees and other amounts accrued for the account of such Lender or the Issuing
Bank hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.13 and Section 2.15);
provided, further, that, if prior to any such

                                       41

<PAGE>

transfer and assignment the circumstances or event that resulted in such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or
notice under Section 2.14 or the amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.19, as the
case may be, cease to cause such Lender or the Issuing Bank to suffer increased
costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital, or cease to have the consequences specified in Section 2.14, or cease
to result in amounts being payable under Section 2.19, as the case may be
(including as a result of any action taken by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant to paragraph (b) below), or if such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall
waive its right to claim further compensation under Section 2.13 in respect of
such circumstances or event or shall withdraw its notice under Section 2.14 or
shall waive its right to further payments under Section 2.19 in respect of such
circumstances or event, as the case may be, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank
shall not thereafter be required to make any such transfer and assignment
hereunder.

                  (b)      If (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall request
compensation under Section 2.13; (ii) any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a
notice described in Section 2.14; or (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Governmental
Authority on account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank, pursuant to Section
2.19, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts (which
shall not require such Lender or the Issuing Bank to incur an unreimbursed loss
or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take any action inconsistent with
its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or suffer any
disadvantage or burden deemed by it to be significant) (x) to file any
certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or (y)
to assign its rights and delegate and transfer its obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if such filing or assignment
would reduce its claims for compensation under Section 2.13 or enable it to
withdraw its notice pursuant to Section 2.14 or would reduce amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.19, as the case may be, in the future. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the
Issuing Bank in connection with any such filing or assignment, delegation and
transfer.

         SECTION 2.21.     Letters of Credit.

                  (a)      General. The Borrower may request the issuance of a
Letter of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
while the Commitments remain in effect. This Section 2.21 shall not be construed
to impose an obligation upon the Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that
is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
to amend, renew or extend an existing Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand
deliver or telecopy to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least
two Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, the date of
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) below), the amount of
such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such
other information as shall be

                                       42

<PAGE>

necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and
warrant that, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the L/C Exposure shall not exceed $20,000,000 and (ii) the
Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Total Commitment as in
effect at such time, and (iii) if applicable under Section 2.23, the Aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the Total
Commitment and (y) the Borrowing Base, as in effect at such time. The Issuing
Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit within 14 days after notice
given pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 2.21. The existing letters
of credit identified on Schedule 2.21(b) shall be deemed issued under and
pursuant to this Section 2.21(b) and shall be treated as Letters of Credit for
all purposes under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
at the close of business on the earlier of (x) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (unless the Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent shall agree otherwise) and (y) in any event, the date that
is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, unless such
Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date.

                  (d)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders,
the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each such Lender hereby
acquires from the applicable Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of
Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance
of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing,
each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower (or, if applicable, another party pursuant to its
obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date due as provided
in Section 2.02(f). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph (d) in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default,
and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e)      Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than the
end of the day on which the Borrower shall have received notice from the Issuing
Bank that payment of such draft will be made, or, if the Borrower shall have
received such notice later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on any Business
Day, not later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the immediately following
Business Day (it being acknowledged that the Borrower may pay such L/C
Disbursement from the unused portion of the Revolving Commitment).

                  (f)      Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations to
reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) above shall be
absolute, unconditional and

                                       43

<PAGE>

irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:

                           (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of
         any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision
         therein;

                           (ii)     any amendment or waiver of or any consent to
         departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or
         any Loan Document;

                           (iii)    the existence of any claim, setoff, defense
         or other right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or
         otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or other
         Affiliate thereof or any other person may at any time have against the
         beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other person, whether in
         connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
         related or unrelated agreement or transaction;

                           (iv)     any draft or other document presented under
         a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                           (v)      payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter
         of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does
         not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

                           (vi)     any other act or omission to act or delay of
         any kind of the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or
         any other person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether
         or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
         provisions of this Section 2.21, constitute a legal or equitable
         discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and
agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder
to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. However, the foregoing shall not be
construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the
extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's
gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it
is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their
face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any
payment under any Letter of Credit, (i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on
the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all
matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft
presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the
beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any
document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to

                                       44

<PAGE>

be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in
order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented
pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any
statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever
and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented
under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be
deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing
Bank.

                  (g)      Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall
as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by telecopy, to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether
the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with
respect to any such L/C Disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
give each Lender notice thereof.

                  (h)      Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any
L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, then, unless the Borrower
shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount
thereof shall bear interest for the account of the Issuing Bank, for each day
from and including the date of such L/C Disbursement, to but excluding the
earlier of the date of payment by the Borrower or the date on which interest
shall commence to accrue thereon as provided in Section 2.02(f), at the rate per
annum that would apply to such amount if such amount were an ABR Loan.

                  (i)      Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank. The
Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 180 days' prior written notice to
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and may be removed at
any time by the Borrower by notice to the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders (it being understood that during such 180 day period the Issuing
Bank will continue to issue the Letters of Credit pursuant to this Agreement).
Subject to the next succeeding sentence, upon (x) the acceptance of any
appointment as the Issuing Bank hereunder by a Lender that shall agree to serve
as successor Issuing Bank and (y) consent to such appointment by the
Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights and
obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank, and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be
discharged from its obligations to issue additional Letters of Credit hereunder.
At the time such removal or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower
shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii). The
acceptance of any appointment as the Issuing Bank hereunder by a successor
Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a
form satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and
after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor Lender shall have
all the rights and obligations of the previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan
Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor
or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing
Banks, as the context shall require. After the resignation or removal of the
Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto
and shall continue to have all the rights and

                                       45

<PAGE>

obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or
removal, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j)      Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives
notice thereof and of the amount to be deposited from the Administrative Agent
or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Revolving Loans has been
accelerated, Lenders holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit
representing 51% or more of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit), deposit in an account with the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the L/C Exposure as of such
date. Such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the
payment and performance of the Obligations. The Collateral Agent shall have
exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal,
over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such
deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of
the Collateral Agent, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in
such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed; (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations
of the Borrower for the L/C Exposure at such time; and (iii) if the maturity of
the Revolving Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders
holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing 51% or more
of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit), be
applied to satisfy the Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, such amount together with any accrued and unapplied earnings thereon
(to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower
within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
waived.

                  (k)      Additional Issuing Banks. The Borrower may, at any
time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or
more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this
Agreement. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph
(k) shall be deemed (in addition to being a Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with
respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and all
references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank"
shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Lender
in its capacity as Issuing Bank, as the context shall require.

         SECTION 2.22.     Funding Sources. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to obligate the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Borrowing, Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender that it has obtained or
will obtain the funds for any Borrowing, Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement in
any particular place or manner.

         SECTION 2.23.   Negative Exchange Event.

         (a) Upon the occurrence of a Negative Exchange Event, Administrative
Agent shall provide Borrower with notice of such Negative Exchange Event and ten
(10) days after such notice is given, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 2.01 or elsewhere in this Agreement, no Lender shall,
pursuant to Section 2.01 or otherwise, make any Revolving Loan to or for the
account of the Borrower, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to borrow, if,
after giving effect to the requested Revolving Loan, the Aggregate Revolving
Credit Exposure would exceed the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment and (ii) the
Borrowing Base as in effect at such time.

         In addition, Borrower shall thereafter comply with the repayment
provisions of Section 2.12 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding that a Negative
Exchange Event shall cease to occur, Borrower shall remain subject to the
requirements and limitations of this Section 2.23 unless (a) otherwise approved
by Required Lenders or (b) the Negative Exchange Event shall cease to occur for
at least forty-five (45) consecutive Business Days, in which case Administrative
Agent shall duly notify Borrower of such event.

         (b) As used in this Section 2.23, the following terms have the
following meanings:

                           "Borrowing Base" shall mean, as at any date, the sum
         of (i) 50% of the aggregate value of Eligible Inventory at said date
         which has been Eligible Inventory for one year or less, (ii) 25% of the
         aggregate value of Eligible Inventory which has been Eligible Inventory
         at said date for over one year (but less than 24 months) from the date
         it became Eligible Inventory, (iii) 0% of the aggregate value of
         Eligible Inventory at said date which has been Eligible Inventory for
         24 months or more from the date it became Eligible Inventory) and (iv)
         80% of the aggregate value of Eligible Accounts Receivable at said
         date.

                           "Borrowing Base Certificate" shall mean a certificate
         of a Financial Officer of the Borrower, substantially in the form of
         Exhibit E and appropriately completed.

                           "Eligible Accounts Receivable" shall mean, as at any
         date of determination, Accounts solely of the Borrower that arise from
         the bona fide sale and delivery, in the ordinary course of business, of
         Inventory. Without limiting the foregoing, to qualify as an Eligible
         Account Receivable, an Account shall indicate as sole payee and as sole
         remittance party, the Borrower. In determining the amount to be so
         included, the face amount of Accounts shall be reduced by the amount of
         all returns, discounts, claims, credits, charges, chargebacks,
         collections in transit, markdown allowances, extra or co-op advertising
         credits, rebates, advances, deposits, progress payments or other
         allowances and by the aggregate amount of all reserves, limits and
         deductions provided for in this definition and elsewhere in this
         Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Eligible
         Account Receivable shall not include prepayment penalties, sales or
         other taxes or interest. Unless otherwise approved, from time to time,
         in writing by the Administrative Agent, no Account shall be deemed to
         be an Eligible Account Receivable if:

                                       47

<PAGE>

                  (a)      the Borrower does not have sole lawful and absolute
         title to such Account; or

                  (b)      the Account is not the valid, binding and legally
         enforceable obligation of the account debtor subject, as to

         reorganization, moratorium or similar laws at the time in effect
         affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally and (ii)
         judicial discretion in connection with the remedy of specific
         performance and other equitable remedies; or

                  (c)      it arises out of a sale made by the Borrower to an

         debtor and such of its Affiliates in the aggregate are ineligible under
         clause (d) above; or

                  (f)      the account debtor for the Account is a creditor of
         any Loan Party, has or has asserted a right of setoff, has disputed its
         liability or has made any claim with respect to the Account or any
         other Account which has not been resolved, to the extent of the amount
         owed by such Loan Party to the account debtor, the amount of such
         actual or asserted right of setoff (whichever is greater) or the amount
         of such dispute or claim, as the case may be; or

                  (g)      the account debtor for such Account has presently

         unless such Account constitutes an administrative expense (or claim of
         similar priority) in such proceeding; or

                  (h)      the sale to the account debtor is on a bill-and-hold,

         written agreement providing for repurchase or

         the Liens (if any) permitted by the applicable Security Document, or
         (iv) it does not otherwise conform to the representations and
         warranties contained in the Loan Documents; or

                  (m)      as to all or any part of such Account a check,
         promissory note, draft, trade acceptance or other instrument for the

         the Administrative Agent; or

                  (c)      it is not located on property owned or leased by the
         Borrower or in a contract warehouse, in each case, specified on

         accepted by the Administrative Agent), and, except as otherwise
         approved by the Administrative Agent, covered by a collateral access
         agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent and executed by the lessor, or the contract

         other Loan Party), stored on the premises; or

         Inventory stored at sites described in clause (c) above, for Liens for
         unpaid rent or normal and customary warehousing charges, in each case,
         not yet due; or

                  (f)      it is goods returned or rejected by the Borrower's
         customers to the extent the invoice price of such returns and
         rejections exceeds $5.0 million in the aggregate since the beginning of
         the fiscal quarter four quarters prior to such calculation or goods in
         transit to third parties (other than to warehouse sites covered by a

         used or repossessed or is attached, seized, made subject to a writ or
         distress warrant, levied upon or brought within the possession of any
         receiver, trustee, custodian or assignee for the benefit of creditors;

         consummated in the ordinary course of business unless the Borrower has
         complied with all applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer laws in
         connection with such acquisition; or

                  (k)      the Administrative Agent, in the good faith exercise
         of its discretion, determines, upon three Business Days' notice to the
         Borrower, it to be ineligible.

                  (c)      During the effectiveness of this Section 2.23,
         Borrower shall deliver the following additional reporting documents:

                           (x)      Borrowing Base Audits. At the request of the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, but in no event more frequently
than (i) annually, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii)
monthly in the event a Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (iii)
at any time in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a
report, the scope and cost of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Lenders and the Borrower (the reasonable cost and expense of which shall be for
the sole account of the Borrower), of an independent collateral auditor (which
may be, or be affiliated with, one of the Lenders) with respect to the Accounts
and Inventory included in the Borrowing Base as at the end of a monthly
accounting period, which report shall indicate that, based upon a review by such
auditors of the Accounts and Inventory (including verification as to the value,
location and respective types), the information set forth in the Borrowing Base
Certificate delivered by the Borrower as at the end of such accounting period is
accurate and complete in all material respects; and

                           (y)      Borrowing Base Certificate. As soon as
available and in any event within ten Business Days after the end of each
monthly accounting period (ending on the last day of each calendar month)
beginning with the monthly accounting period ending as of the month such
Negative Exchange Event occurred, a Borrowing Base Certificate as of the last
day of such accounting period (subject to adjustments with respect to such
certificates which are not issued at a fiscal quarter end not to exceed $500,000
in respect of intercompany transfers of inventory; provided that notice is given
of such adjustments that would decrease the Borrowing Base in excess of $50,000
within ten Business Days of the delivery of such certificate); each Borrowing
Base Certificate shall have attached to it such additional schedules and/or
other information as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (if the
Borrower fails to deliver any such Borrowing Base Certificate within ten
Business Days after the end of any such month or within 15 Business Days after
the end of any such month that is also a fiscal quarter end, then the Borrowing
Base shall be deemed to be $0 (however, no prepayment shall be required pursuant
to Section 2.12(a) solely by reason of such deemed reduction) until such time as
the Borrower shall deliver such required Borrowing Base Certificate); the
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent promptly upon becoming

                                       51

<PAGE>

aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Borrowing Base.

Subsidiaries (a) is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

validly existing or in good standing individually, or together with all such

Material Adverse Effect; (b) has all requisite corporate or other power and
authority to own or lease its property and to carry on its business as now

performance by each Loan Party of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a
party and the consummation by the Loan Parties of the Transactions (including
the borrowings hereunder) (i) have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate or other constitutional and, if required, stockholder action and (ii)
will not (A) violate (I) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or of the certificate or articles
of incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Borrower or

         SECTION 3.03.     Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document when
executed and delivered by the each Loan Party thereto will constitute, a legal,
valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan
Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
the enforceability of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles of
general applicability (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         SECTION 3.04.     Governmental Approvals. No action, consent or
approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by any Governmental
Authority is or will be required in connection with the Transactions, except for
(a) the filing of UCC financing statements and (b) such as have been made or
obtained and are in full force and effect.

         SECTION 3.05.     Financial Statements.

                  (a)      The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders
its consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000, 2001
and 2002, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers

statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
(except as disclosed therein), shall conform to Section 5.04(a) of this
Agreement, and present fairly and accurately in all material respects the
financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower as
of such dates and for such periods. Except as set forth in such financial
statements or otherwise disclosed in the Schedules hereto, there are no
liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any kind, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably be
expected to result in such a liability, other than liabilities under the Loan
Documents and the Notes Documents.

                  (b)      All financial statements delivered pursuant to
Section 5.04 will be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and
present fairly and accurately in all material respects the financial condition
and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower as of such dates and
for such periods (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end adjustments). Except as set forth in such financial statements or
otherwise disclosed in the Schedules hereto, there are no material liabilities
of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any kind, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances which could reasonably be expected
to result in such a liability, other than liabilities under the Loan Documents
and the Notes Documents.

         SECTION 3.06.     No Material Adverse Change. There has been no
material adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

                  (a)      Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has good
and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its Real Property
free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

                  (b)      Each Lease to which any Loan Party is a party is
valid and in full force and effect and none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is
in default under any such Lease and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, the other
party or parties thereto are not in default of its or their obligations
thereunder except for defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Title to all property (other than Real Property) is
held by the Borrower and/or each Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens except
for Permitted Liens.

                  (d)      The property of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (i) is in good operating order, condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) and (ii) constitutes all the assets and properties which
are required for the business and operations of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

                  (e)      None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has received
any notice of, nor has any knowledge of, the occurrence or pendency or
contemplation of any Casualty Event affecting all or any material portion of its
respective property.

         SECTION 3.08.     Subsidiaries.

                  (a)      Schedule 3.08(a) sets forth a list of all
Subsidiaries and the percentage Equity Interest of the Loan Parties therein. The
Equity Interests so indicated on Schedule 3.08(a) are fully paid and
non-assessable and are owned by the Borrower, directly or indirectly, free and
clear of all Liens other than Liens created by the Security Agreement.

                  (b)      An accurate organization chart, showing the ownership
structure of the Borrower and each Subsidiary on the Closing Date, and after
giving effect to the Transactions, is set forth on Schedule 3.08(b).

         SECTION 3.09.     Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

                  (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09 or Schedule
3.17, there are not any actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or
before any Governmental Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, threatened against or affecting the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any business, property or rights of any such person (i) that
involve any Loan Document or the Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a
reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Except for matters covered by Section 3.17, none of
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective property is in
violation of, nor will the continued

                                       54

<PAGE>

operation of their property as currently conducted violate, any Requirements of
Law (including any zoning or building ordinance, code or approval or any
building permits) or any restrictions of record or agreements affecting the Real
Property or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree
or order of any Governmental Authority, where such violation or default could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.10.     Agreements.

                  (a)      None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party to
any agreement or instrument or subject to any corporate or other constitutional
restriction that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is in default
in any manner under any provision of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any other agreement or instrument to
which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is or may be bound,
where such default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is in default in any manner under
any provision of any of the Notes Documents.

                  (c)      Schedule 3.10(a) accurately and completely lists all
material agreements (other than Leases of Real Property set forth on Schedule
3.10(b)) to which the Borrower and any Subsidiary are a party which are in
effect on the date hereof in connection with the operation of the business
conducted thereby and whether such material agreement requires the consent of
any third-party thereunder to the Transactions.

         SECTION 3.11.     Federal Reserve Regulations.

                  (a)      None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b)      No part of the proceeds of any Revolving Loan or any
Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether
immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose that entails a
violation of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of
the Board, including Regulation T, U or X.

         SECTION 3.12.     Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding
Company Act. None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is (a) an "investment
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         SECTION 3.13.     Use of Proceeds. All proceeds of all Revolving Loans
shall be used solely for the Borrower's and the Subsidiaries' working capital
and general corporate purposes (including to effect Permitted Acquisitions).

         SECTION 3.14.     Tax Returns. Each of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all Federal tax returns and all
material, state, local and foreign tax returns or materials required to have
been filed by it and has paid or caused to be paid all

                                       55

<PAGE>

taxes due and payable by it and all assessments received by it, except taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall have set aside on its
books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.

         SECTION 3.15.     No Material Misstatements. None of any information,
report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation of any Loan Document or included therein or delivered pursuant
thereto contained, contains or will contain, taken as a whole, any material
misstatement of fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were, are or will be made, not misleading as of the date such
information is dated or certified; provided that, to the extent any such
information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or
constitutes a forecast or projection, the Borrower represents only that it acted
in good faith and utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the
preparation of such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or
schedule.

         SECTION 3.16.     Employee Benefit Plans. Each of the Borrower and its
ERISA Affiliates is, with respect to each Plan, in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all
other such ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to result in material
liability of the Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates. The present value of
all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting
such amounts, exceed by more than $14,200,000 the fair market value of the
assets of all such underfunded Plans. Using actuarial assumptions and
computation methods consistent with subpart 1 of subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of each Borrower, Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate
to all Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom, as
of the close of the most recent fiscal year of each such Multiemployer Plan,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.17.      Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.17:

                  (a)      The Real Property owned or operated by the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries do not contain any Hazardous Materials in amounts or
concentrations which (i) constitute, or constituted a violation of, (ii) require
Remedial Action under, or (iii) could give rise to liability under,
Environmental Laws, which violations, Remedial Actions and liabilities, in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (b)      The Real Property and all operations of the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries are in compliance, and in the last three years have been in
compliance, with all applicable Environmental Laws and all necessary
Environmental Permits have been obtained and are in effect, except to the extent
that such non-compliance or failure to obtain any

                                       56

<PAGE>

necessary permits, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (c)      There have been no Releases or threatened Releases by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to their knowledge, by any other party, at,
from, under or proximate to the Real Property or otherwise in connection with
the operations of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries, which Releases or threatened
Releases, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect;

                  (d)      None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has received
any notice of an Environmental Claim in connection with the Real Property or the
operations of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries or with regard to any person
whose liabilities for environmental matters the Borrower or the Subsidiaries has
retained or assumed, in whole or in part, contractually, by operation of law or
otherwise, which, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (e)      Hazardous Materials have not been transported from
the Real Property by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, nor have
Hazardous Materials been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or
under any of the Real Property in a manner that could give rise to liability
under any Environmental Law, nor have the Borrower or the Subsidiaries retained
or assumed any liability, contractually or by operation of law, with respect to
the generation, treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Materials, which
transportation, generation, treatment, storage or disposal, or retained or
assumed liabilities, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.18.     Insurance. Schedule 3.18 sets forth a true, complete
and correct description of each insurance policy that purports to provide
coverage in excess of $1.0 million maintained by the Borrower or by the Borrower
for the Subsidiaries. Such insurance is in full force and effect and all
premiums have been duly paid. The Borrower and the Subsidiaries have insurance
in such amounts and covering such risks and liabilities as are in accordance
with normal industry practice.

         SECTION 3.19.     Security Documents.

                  (a)      The Security Agreement is effective to create in
favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal,
valid and enforceable security interest in and Lien on the Pledged Collateral
and, when (i) financing statements and other filings in appropriate form are
filed in the offices specified on Schedule 3.3 to the Security Agreement, and
(ii) the Securities Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement) is
delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Security Agreement shall constitute a
fully perfected first priority Lien on, and security interest in, all right,
title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such Pledged Collateral (other
than such Pledged Collateral in which a security interest cannot be perfected
under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect at the relevant time in the
relevant jurisdiction), in each case subject to no Liens other than Permitted
Liens.

                  (b)      Each Security Document delivered pursuant to Section
5.11 will, upon execution and delivery thereof, be effective to create in favor
of the Collateral Agent, for the

                                       57

<PAGE>

ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on
all of the Loan Parties' right, title and interest in and to the Collateral
thereunder, and when such Security Document is filed or recorded in the
appropriate offices as may be required under applicable law, such Security
Document will constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Collateral, in each
case subject to no Liens other than the applicable Permitted Liens.

         SECTION 3.20.     Labor Matters. As of the Closing Date, there are no
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and
payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal,
state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters in any manner which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All payments due
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and
welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability
on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary except where the failure to do
so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination
or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective
bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

         SECTION 3.21.     Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately following the making
of each Revolving Loan and after giving effect to the application of the
proceeds of each Revolving Loan, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan
Party will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of each Loan
Party will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability on its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c)
each Loan Party will be able to pay the probable liability on its debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct its business in which it is
engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted
following the Closing Date.

         SECTION 3.22.     Intellectual Property. Each Loan Party owns, or is
licensed to use, all patents, patent applications, trademarks, tradenames,
servicemarks, copyrights, technology, trade secrets, proprietary information,
know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted (the "Intellectual Property"), except for those the failure to own or
license which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and
is pending by any person challenging or questioning the use of any such
Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual
Property, nor does any Loan Party know of any valid basis for any such claim,
except for such claims that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The use of such
Intellectual Property by each Loan Party does not infringe the rights of any
person, except for such claims and infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                       58

<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.23.     PP&E. Borrower and each Domestic Subsidiary owns the
PP&E described as "owned" in the financial statements delivered to
Administrative Agent prior to the date of this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.24.     No Burdensome Restrictions. Except as may have been
disclosed by the Loan Parties in writing to the Administrative Agent, no Loan
Party is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any other
obligation or any charter or corporate or partnership restriction, as the case
may be, which, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                              Conditions of Lending

         The obligations of the Lenders to make Revolving Loans and of the
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder are subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

         SECTION 4.01.     All Credit Events. On the date of each Borrowing and
on the date of each issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of
Credit (each such event being called a "Credit Event"):

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall have received a notice
of such Borrowing Request (or such notice shall have been deemed given in
accordance with Section 2.03) or, in the case of the issuance, amendment,
extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent shall have received a notice requesting the issuance,
amendment, extension or renewal of such Letter of Credit as required by Section
2.21(b).

                  (b)      The Borrower and each other Loan Party shall be in
compliance in all material respects with all the terms and provisions set forth
herein and in each other Loan Document on its part to be observed or performed,
and, at the time of and immediately after such Credit Event, no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing.

                  (c)      The representations and warranties set forth in
Article III hereof or in any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in
all material respects on and as of the date of such Credit Event with the same
effect as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

                  (d)      If Section 2.23 of this Agreement is then applicable,
for each Revolving Credit Loan and each Letter of Credit issuance, the Borrowing
Base (as determined upon the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered
hereunder) shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure after giving
effect to such Credit Event.

                  (e)      No law or regulation shall have been adopted, no
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority shall have been issued,
and no litigation shall be pending, which does or seeks to enjoin, prohibit or
restrain, the making or repayment of the Revolving Loans.

                                       59

<PAGE>

                  (f)      There shall not have occurred any event or
circumstances that has had or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect since September 30, 2002.

                  (g)      If Section 2.23 of this Agreement is then applicable,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received and the
Administrative Agent shall be satisfied (as to form and substance) with a
Borrowing Base Certificate prepared as of the Business Day immediately preceding
such Credit Event.

         Each Credit Event and each delivery of a Borrowing Request shall be
deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower on the date
of such Credit Event as to the matters specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)
of this Section 4.01.

         SECTION 4.02.     Closing Date. On the Closing Date:

                  (a)      Loan Documents. All legal matters incident to this
Agreement, the Borrowings and extensions of credit hereunder and the other Loan
Documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders, to the Issuing Bank
and to the Administrative Agent and there shall have been delivered to the
Administrative Agent an executed counterpart of each Revolving Note and each of
the other Loan Documents and a reaffirmation of each Security Document and the
Perfection Certificate in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative
Agent.

                  (b)      Fees. The Arranger and Administrative Agent shall
have received all Fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the
Closing Date, as set forth in an invoice containing reasonable detail,
including, to the extent invoiced, reimbursement or payment of all out-of-pocket
expenses (including the legal fees and expenses of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &
Hampton LLP, counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
Arranger, and the fees and expenses of any foreign local counsel) required to be
reimbursed or paid by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

                  (c)      Opinions of Counsel. The Administrative Agent shall
have received, on behalf of itself, the other Agents, the Arranger, the Lenders
and the Issuing Bank, favorable written opinions of Gardner, Carton & Douglas
and Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman Machtinger & Kinsella LLP, counsels for the
Loan Parties, substantially to the effect set forth in Exhibit I-1, (a) dated
the Closing Date, (b) addressed to the Issuing Bank, the Agents, the Arranger
and the Lenders and (c) covering such other matters relating to the Loan
Documents and the Transactions as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
request, and the Borrower hereby requests such counsel to deliver such opinions.

                  (d)      Corporate Documents. The Administrative Agent shall
have received (i) a copy of the certificate or articles of incorporation or
other constitutive documents, including all amendments thereto, of the Borrower,

organization, and a certificate as to the good standing of the Borrower as of a

10 days after any Responsible Officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary knows or
has reason to know that, any ERISA Event has occurred that, alone or together
with any other ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to result in liability
of the Borrower in an aggregate amount exceeding $1,000,000, a statement of a
Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth details as to such ERISA Event
and the action, if any, that the Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto,
and (ii) upon request by the Administrative Agent, copies of: (i) each Schedule
B (Actuarial Information) to the annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate with the Internal Revenue

         SECTION 5.07.     Maintaining Records; Access to Properties and
Inspections. Keep proper books of record and account in which full, true and
correct entries in conformity with GAAP and all Requirements of Law are made of
all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities, except
where the failure to comply with such Requirements of Law could not have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower will, and will cause each of the
Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to visit and inspect the financial records and the property
of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at reasonable times during regular business
hours, upon reasonable notice and as often as reasonably requested and to make
extracts from and copies of such financial records, in each case in the presence
of an employee of any Loan Party, and permit any representatives designated by

condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary with the officers thereof and
independent accountants therefor.

         SECTION 5.08.     Use of Proceeds. Use the proceeds of the Revolving

material respects with all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits
applicable to its operations and Real Property; obtain and renew all material
Environmental Permits necessary for its operations and Real Property; and
conduct any Remedial Action in accordance with Environmental Laws, except in the
case of any of the foregoing where the failure to do the same, individually or
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall be
required to undertake any Remedial Action to the extent that its obligation to
do so is being contested in good faith

                                       69

and by proper proceedings and appropriate reserves are being maintained with
respect to such circumstances in accordance with GAAP.

         SECTION 5.10.     Preparation of Environmental Reports. If a Default
caused by reason of a breach of Section 3.17 or Section 5.09 shall have occurred
and be continuing for more than 30 days without the Borrower or the Subsidiaries
commencing activities reasonably likely to cure such Default, at the written
request of the Required Lenders through the Administrative Agent, provide to the
Lenders within 60 days after such request, at the expense of the Borrower, an
environmental site assessment report regarding the matters which are the subject
of such Default prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and indicating the presence or absence of
Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any compliance or Remedial Action
in connection with such Default.

         SECTION 5.11.     Further Assurances; Additional Collateral.

                  (a)      Execute any and all further documents, financing
statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further action (including,
giving notices of assignment, filing UCC and other financing statements and
delivering legal opinions and, in the event a Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, including creation of lockbox, cash collection accounts and/or sweep
accounts) that may be required under applicable law, or that the Required
Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may request, in order
to, among other things, effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents and in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and
first priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by
the Security Documents.

                  (b)      The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it is
their intention that the Obligations shall be secured by, among other things, a
first priority Lien (subject only to Permitted Liens) on all of the domestic
Accounts and Inventory and Pledged Securities owned by the Borrower (and such
Accounts, Inventory and Pledged Securities owned by any Subsidiary to the extent
required to be pledged pursuant to Section 5.11(f) hereof), whether now owned or
hereafter acquired. Promptly, and in any event within 30 days after the
acquisition of any Accounts, Inventory or Pledged Securities by the Borrower
(and/or such Accounts, Inventory and Pledged Securities owned by any Subsidiary
to the extent required to be Pledged pursuant to Section 5.11(f) hereof) or any
Permitted Acquisition, the Borrower will, at its sole cost and expense, promptly
secure the Obligations by pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or
created, perfected first priority security interests with respect to such
Accounts, Inventory or Pledged Securities, as applicable. Such security
interests and Liens will be created under the Security Documents and other
instruments and documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent, and the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Collateral Agent all such instruments and documents (including legal opinions,
lien waivers, and lien searches) as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably
request to evidence compliance with this Section 5.11. The Borrower shall take
all further action of the type described in Section 5.11(a) in order to grant,
preserve, protect and perfect such Lien and security interest.

                  (c)      In addition to the Borrower's obligations under
Section 5.04(e) and under Section 2.23(c), if and when applicable, the Borrower
shall, from time to time, provide such evidence as the Collateral Agent shall
reasonably request as to the perfection and priority status of each security
interest and Lien contemplated herein. With respect to each Real Property in
which a Loan Party holds the tenant's interest thereunder set forth on Schedule
3.10(b) and where Collateral is located, such Loan Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable a Landlord
Lien Waiver and Access Agreement substantially as set forth in Exhibit F with
such additions, deletions and/or changes as shall be acceptable to the
Collateral Agent.

                  (d)      The Borrower shall, with respect to each Real
Property in which a Loan Party holds the tenant's interest thereunder as set
forth on Schedule 3.10(b) and at which Collateral is located and to the extent
that the same has not been delivered to the Collateral Agent on or prior to the
Closing Date, take all further commercially reasonable action necessary to
obtain a Landlord Lien Waiver and Access Agreement with respect to such Real
Property and a reaffirmation of such Landlord Lien Waiver and Access Agreement,
if required by Administrative Agent; provided that a demand by any landlord for
a material increase in the rent for such Real Property or a material extension
of the lease relating thereto shall be deemed commercially unreasonable;
provided, further, that each Loan Party will furnish to the Lenders and their
counsel on the first Business Day of each month beginning January 1, 2003, a
status report describing such actions and to the extent that a landlord shall
refuse to execute a Landlord Lien Waiver and Access Agreement, a detailed
description of the reason for such refusal and/or the exact terms pursuant to
which such landlord would have agreed to execute such agreement if such terms
were deemed commercially unreasonable by the Borrower.

                  (e)      As promptly as practicable and in any event not later
than 60 days after the Closing Date, (i) the Borrower shall have authorized,
executed and delivered all documents and taken all actions necessary or
appropriate to grant in favor of the Collateral Agent a fully perfected first
priority pledge of and security interest in the Pledged Securities identified on
Schedule 5.11(e)(i) hereto under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of
the applicable issuer of such Pledged Securities (including, without limitation,
the taking of all actions or the foreign equivalent, if applicable, and the
delivery of all items, or their foreign equivalent, if applicable, of the type
and nature enumerated in Section 4.02(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(5) and (h)(6) of this
Agreement, and the delivery of all certificates, agreements or instruments
representing such Pledged Securities, accompanied by instruments of transfer
endorsed in blank to the extent required or permitted under the jurisdiction or
organization of the applicable issuer of such Pledged Securities) and (ii) the
Collateral Agent shall have received, on behalf of itself, the other Agents, the
Arranger, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, a favorable written opinion of each
foreign counsel listed on Schedule 5.11(e)(ii), substantially to the effect set
forth in Exhibit I-2 and with such additions, deletions and/or changes as shall
be acceptable to the Collateral Agent, (a) dated no later than such 60th day
after the Closing Date, (b) addressed to the Issuing Bank, the Agents, the
Arranger and the Lenders and (c) covering such other matters relating to the
Loan Documents and the Transactions as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
request, and the Borrower hereby requests such counsel to deliver such opinions.

                  (f)      If, after the Closing Date, (i) the Borrower or any
Domestic Subsidiary shall acquire or create a Domestic Subsidiary or Direct
Foreign Subsidiary (other than an Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary or an
Insignificant Direct Foreign Subsidiary), (ii) any Direct Foreign Subsidiary
that was an Insignificant Direct Foreign Subsidiary fails to continue to qualify
as an Insignificant Direct Foreign Subsidiary, (iii) any Insignificant Domestic
Subsidiary fails to continue to qualify as an Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary
or (iv) the Administrative Agent shall so request with respect to any Domestic
Subsidiary or Direct Foreign Subsidiary (other than an Insignificant Domestic
Subsidiary or an Insignificant Direct Foreign Subsidiary), then, in each such
case, the Borrower shall or shall cause the applicable Domestic Subsidiary or
Direct Foreign Subsidiary (other than an Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary or an
Insignificant Direct Foreign Subsidiary), at its expense:

                           (A)      within 30 days after such event, duly
                  execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent (i) a joinder
                  agreement and/or pledge amendment to the Security Agreement
                  and (ii) a pledge agreement securing payment of all the
                  Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents and
                  creating a first priority security interest in, and Lien on,
                  not less than (x) 100% of the voting Equity Interest of the
                  applicable Domestic Subsidiary or (y) 65% of the voting Equity
                  Interest of the applicable Direct Foreign Subsidiary owned by
                  the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in form
                  and substance sufficient under the laws of such Domestic
                  Subsidiary's or Direct Foreign Subsidiary's jurisdiction of
                  organization and otherwise acceptable to the Collateral Agent,
                  and take, and cause such Subsidiary to take, whatever other
                  action may be necessary or advisable in the reasonable opinion
                  of the Collateral Agent, to perfect the first priority
                  security interest in and Lien on the Equity Interest purported
                  to be created by such pledge, subject to no Liens, and
                  enforceable against all third parties in accordance with its
                  terms;

                           (B)      within 30 days after such event, deliver to
                  the Collateral Agent, upon the request of the Collateral Agent
                  in its reasonable discretion, a signed copy of a legal opinion
                  of foreign counsel substantially to the effect set forth in
                  Exhibit I-2 and with such additions, deletions and/or changes
                  as shall be acceptable to the Collateral Agent, addressed to
                  the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, of counsel for the Loan
                  Parties reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent and such
                  other opinions as to such other matters as the Collateral
                  Agent may reasonably request; and

                           (C)      at any time and from time to time, promptly
                  execute and deliver any and all further instruments and
                  documents (including, without limitation, solvency
                  certificates with respect to such pledge) and take all such
                  action as the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or
                  reasonably desirable to obtain the full benefits of the
                  agreements described in Section 5.11(f)(A) above, and/or to
                  perfect and preserve the first priority Liens in favor of the
                  Collateral Agent on the applicable Equity Interests pledged
                  hereby.

                  (g)      Each Loan Party agrees that, unless otherwise

                                       72

<PAGE>

the date such action is requested or required to be taken. The foregoing
requirement of Section 5.11(f) shall not apply from and after the Rating Date
until the Downgrade Date, if any.

         SECTION 5.12.     Certain Matters Relating to Accounts.

                  (a)      Upon the Collateral Agent's demand made at any time
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and at
the Borrower's or the applicable Loan Party's sole cost and expense, deliver or
cause to be delivered all tangible evidence of Accounts, including, without
limitation, copies of all documents evidencing Accounts and of any books and
records relating thereto to the Collateral Agent or to its representatives. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral
Agent may transfer a full and complete copy of any Loan Party's books, records,
credit information, reports, memoranda and all other writing relating to the
Accounts to and for the use by any person that has acquired or is contemplating
acquisition of an interest in the Accounts or the Collateral Agent's security
interest therein without the consent of any Loan Party.

                  (b)      At the request of the Collateral Agent made at any
time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and
in form and manner reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, legend the
Accounts and the other books, records and documents of such Loan Party
evidencing or pertaining to the Accounts with an appropriate reference to the
fact that the Accounts have been pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit
of the Secured Parties and that the Collateral Agent has a security interest
therein.

                  (c)      Deliver to the Collateral Agent, within 10 days after
receipt thereof by Borrower or any Loan Party, any Instrument evidencing
Accounts which is in the principal amount of $50,000 or more. Any Instrument
delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 5.12(b) shall be
appropriately endorsed (if applicable) to the order of the Collateral Agent, as
agent for the Secured Parties, and shall be held by the Collateral Agent as
further security hereunder; provided, however, that so long as no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Collateral Agent
is collecting Accounts, the Collateral Agent shall, promptly upon request of
such Loan Party, make appropriate arrangements for making any Instrument pledged
by such Loan Party available to such Loan Party for purposes of presentation,
collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected, to the extent
reasonably deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent, against trust receipt or
like document).

         SECTION 5.13.     Guarantees.

                  (a)      If, after the Closing Date, (a) the Borrower or any
Subsidiary shall acquire or create another Subsidiary (other than (i) an
Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary or (ii) a Foreign Subsidiary) or (b) any
Subsidiary that was an Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary fails to continue to
qualify as an Insignificant Domestic Subsidiary then, in each such case, cause
such Subsidiary to:

                                       73

<PAGE>

                           (1)      execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent
                  a Guarantee Agreement; and

                           (2)      deliver to the Lenders one or more opinions
                  of counsel satisfactory to the Collateral Agent that such
                  Guarantee Agreement (x) has been duly authorized, executed and
                  delivered by such Subsidiary and (y) constitutes a valid and
                  legally binding obligation of such Subsidiary in accordance
                  with its terms.

                  In addition, in the event that (a) the aggregate net sales of
         all Insignificant Domestic Subsidiaries which have not become
         Guarantors exceed 5.0% of the consolidated net sales of the Borrower
         and the Subsidiaries for any fiscal quarter or (b) the aggregate
         tangible assets of all Insignificant Domestic Subsidiaries which have
         not become Guarantors exceed 5.0% of Total Tangible Assets as of the
         end of any such fiscal quarter, the Borrower shall cause one or more
         Domestic Subsidiaries to become Guarantors and take such other actions
         so that the Insignificant Domestic Subsidiaries which have not become
         Guarantors do not exceed in the aggregate either of the totals in
         clauses (a) or (b) of this paragraph.

                  The Borrower may at its option cause any other Subsidiary to
         become a Guarantor by complying with the provisions of clause (1) and
         (2) above.

                  (b)      Cause each Subsidiary which now or hereafter
guarantees any of the obligations under the Borrower's 11% Senior Notes due
2008, concurrent with the granting of any such guarantee, to guarantee the
Borrower's obligations hereunder by duly executing and delivering a Guarantee
Agreement.

         SECTION 5.14.     Release of Certain Collateral.

         From and after the Rating Date, the Collateral Agent shall at the
written request and sole expense of the Borrower, take any reasonable action and
execute all reasonable documents and instruments to effect the release of the
Lien of the Security Documents on all stock of Direct Foreign Subsidiaries. Such
release shall no longer be permitted if any Downgrade Date occurs, and the
Borrower shall, at its sole expense, take any action and execute all documents
and instruments necessary or desirable to reattach Liens on 65% of the stock of
Direct Foreign Subsidiaries released after a Rating Date, in each case as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after such Downgrade
Date.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent

         In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(a) Union Bank of California, N.A., is hereby appointed to act as Administrative
Agent and (b) Union Bank of California, N.A., is hereby appointed to act as
Collateral Agent and, in each case, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Bank (for purposes of this Article VIII, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent are referred to collectively as the "Agents"). Each of the
Lenders and each assignee of any such Lender, hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Agents to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee or the Issuing
Bank and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agents by
the terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders and the Issuing Bank,
without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank all payments of principal of and interest on the
Revolving Loans, all payments in respect of L/C Disbursements and all other
amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender
or the Issuing Bank its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give
notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of Default
specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to
distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other
materials delivered by the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents are hereby
expressly authorized to execute any and all documents (including releases and
supplements) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured
Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents.

         Neither the Agents nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by
any of them except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct,
or be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the
contents of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to
ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or
agreements contained in any Loan Document. The Agents shall not be responsible
to the Lenders for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, instruments or
agreements. The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
refraining from acting, in accordance with instructions of the Required Lenders
and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any
action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. Each
Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on
any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. Neither
the Agents nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
shall have any responsibility to the Borrower or any other Loan Party on account
of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender or the Issuing
Bank of any of its obligations hereunder or to any Lender or the Issuing Bank on
account of the

                                       89

<PAGE>

failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the Issuing
Bank or the Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of their respective
obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith
or therewith. Each of the Agents may execute any and all duties hereunder by or
through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

         The Lenders hereby acknowledge that no Agent shall be under any duty to
take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and
the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor, with the written consent of the Borrower, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that such consent shall not
be required if such successor shall be a Lender under this Agreement or if any
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If no successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and consented to by the Borrower as
provided herein and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with
an office in San Francisco, California, having a combined capital and surplus of
at least $5.0 billion or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Agent.

         With respect to the Revolving Loans made by it hereunder, each Agent in
its individual capacity and not as Agent shall have the same rights and powers
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent,
and the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent. The Agents need not account to any
other Lender for any monies received by it for reimbursement of its costs and
expenses as Agents hereunder, or (subject to Section 2.17) for any monies
received by it in its capacity as a Lender hereunder.

         Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on the aggregate amount of its outstanding
Commitment hereunder) of any reasonable expenses incurred for the benefit of the
Lenders by the Agents, including reasonable counsel fees and compensation of
agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, that
shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on
demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all
liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, and

                                       90

<PAGE>

reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as Agent or
any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have been
reimbursed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, provided that no Lender
shall be liable to an Agent or any such other indemnified person for any portion
of such liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents. Each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Issuing Bank and its directors, employees and agents, in each case, to the same
extent and subject to the same limitations as provided above for the Agents.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Syndication Agent and the Arranger shall
have no duties, responsibilities, obligations or liabilities, as such, hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents.

         The Collateral Agent in its capacity as trustee or otherwise under any
Security Document governed by English law (an "English Security Document"), (a)
is not liable for any failure, omission or defect in perfecting or registering
the security constituted or created by any English Security Document, (b) may
accept without enquiry such title as the Borrower or any Guarantor may have to
any asset secured by any English Security Document, (c) is not under any
obligation to hold any English Security Document or any other document in
connection with the Loan Documents or the assets secured by any English Security
Document (including title deeds) in its own possession or to take any steps to
protect or preserve the same, and (d) may permit the Borrower and/or any
Guarantor to retain any English Security Document or other document in its
possession.

         Except where the Collateral Agent holds a legal mortgage over, or over
an interest in, real property or shares, the Collateral Agent in its capacity as
trustee or otherwise shall not be under any obligation to hold any title deeds,
English Security Documents or any other documents in connection with the
property charged by any English Security Document or any other such security in
its own possession or to take any steps to protect or preserve the same. The
Collateral Agent may permit the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case may be,
to retain such title deeds and other documents in its possession.

         All moneys which under the trusts contained in the English Security
Documents are received by the Collateral Agent in its capacity as trustee or
otherwise may be invested in the name of or under the control of the Collateral
Agent in any investment authorized by English

                                       91

<PAGE>

law for the investment by trustees of trust money or in any other investments
which may be selected by the Collateral Agent. Additionally, the same may be
placed on deposits in the name of or under control of the Collateral Agent at
such bank or institution (including the Collateral Agent) and upon such terms as
the Collateral Agent may think fit.

         Each Secured Party authorizes, empowers and directs the Collateral
Agent (by itself or by such person as it may nominate) to execute and enforce
the English Security Documents as trustee on its behalf in accordance with the
terms of such English Security Documents.

number) set forth on the applicable Lender Addendum or in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which such Lender shall have become a party hereto.

with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the

         SECTION 9.02.     Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to

making by the Lenders of the Revolving Loans and the issuance of Letters of
Credit by the Issuing Bank, regardless of any investigation made by the Lenders
or the Issuing Bank or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Revolving Loan
or any Fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so
long as the Commitments have not been terminated. The provisions of Sections
2.13, 2.15, 2.19 and 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Revolving
Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration of any Letter of
Credit, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender.

         SECTION 9.03.     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts (or fax
copies of counterparts) hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures
of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

         SECTION 9.04.     Successors and Assigns.

                  (a)      Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto
is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted
successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements
by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
the Lenders that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the
benefit of their respective successors and assigns.

                  (b)      Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all
or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the
time owing to it); provided, however, that (i) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate or Related Fund of such Lender, (x) the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of any assignment of a Commitment, the
Issuing Bank) must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (y) unless a Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower must give its
prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (z) the amount of the Commitment of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000 (or, if less, the entire
remaining amount of such Lender's Commitment) or such lesser amount as to which
the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower may from time to time agree; and
(ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500.00, payable by such parties except as otherwise
provided herein; and (iii) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon
acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 9.04, from
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (a)
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (b) the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees accrued
for its account and not yet paid).

                  (c)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be
deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim
and that its Commitment, and the outstanding balances of its Revolving Loans,
without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not become effective,
are as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) except as set forth in
(i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in

                                       94

<PAGE>

connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or
the financial condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or
observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it
is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such
assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, respectively, by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by
the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Revolving Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent
and any Lender (with respect to its own interest), at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative
Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) above and, if required, the written consent of the Borrower,
the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent to such assignment, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance; (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register; and (iii) give prompt
notice thereof to the Borrower and the Issuing Bank. No assignment shall be
effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
paragraph (e).

                  (f)      Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower,
the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Revolving
Loans owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such

                                       95

<PAGE>

Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged;  (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations; (iii) the participating banks or other entities
shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection provisions contained in
Sections  2.13,  2.15 and  2.19 to the same extent as if they were Lenders;
provided that no participating bank or other entity shall be entitled to receive
any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Lender would
have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation
transferred by the transferor Lender to such participating bank or other entity
had no such transfer occurred;  and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower relating to the Revolving Loans or L/C Disbursements
and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement  (other than amendments, modifications or waivers increasing or
decreasing the Commitment of such Lender  (except in connection with a ratable
decrease in the Commitments of all Lenders), subjecting such Lender to any
additional obligation, reducing the principal of or rate of interest on, or
change the currency of, any Revolving Loan of such Lender, postponing the date
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Revolving Loan of such
Lender, amending or modifying the definition of the term "Required Lenders", or
modifying the provisions of Section 9.08).

                  (g)      Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 9.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that each such assignee or participant
or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality
of such confidential information on terms no less restrictive than those
applicable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.16.

                  (h)      Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion
of its rights under this Agreement to secure extensions of credit to such Lender
or in support of obligations owed by such Lender; provided that no such
assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding
vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to
provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Revolving Loan that such Granting
Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any
SPC to make any Revolving Loan; and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such
option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Revolving Loan, the
Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the
terms hereof. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize
the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such
Revolving Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby
agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment
obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the
Granting Lender). In

                                       96

<PAGE>

furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or
join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all
or a portion of its interests in any Revolving Loans to the Granting Lender or
to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative
Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such
SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Revolving Loans and (ii) disclose
on a confidential basis on terms no less restrictive than those applicable to
Lenders pursuant to Section 9.16 any non-public information relating to its
Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any
surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

                  (j)      The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its
rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and any attempted
assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

                  (k)      In the event that S&P, Moody's and Thompson (or
InsuranceWatch Ratings Service, in the case of Lenders that are insurance
companies (or Best's Insurance Reports, if such insurance company is not rated
by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) shall, after the date that any Lender
becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term certificate deposit ratings of such
Lender, and the resulting ratings shall be below BBB-, Baa3 and C, respectively
(or BB, in the case of a Lender that is an insurance company (or B, in the case
of an insurance company not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)), then the
Issuing Bank shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its own expense,
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to replace such Lender
with an assignee (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in paragraph (b) above), and such Lender hereby agrees to transfer and assign
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in paragraph (b) above) all its interests, rights and obligations in respect of
its Commitment to such assignee; provided, however, that (i) no such assignment
shall conflict with any law, rule and regulation or order of any Governmental
Authority; (ii) the Issuing Bank or such assignee, as the case may be, shall pay
to such Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the
principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Revolving Loans
made by such Lender hereunder and all other amounts accrued for such Lender's
account or owed to it hereunder; and (iii) such Lender or assignee shall pay the
processing and recordation fee of $3,500.00.

         SECTION 9.05.     Expenses; Indemnity.

                  (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including but not limited to expenses incurred in
connection with due diligence and travel, courier, reproduction, printing and
delivery expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
and the Issuing Bank in connection with the syndication of the credit

                                       97

<PAGE>

facilities provided for herein and the preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection
with any amendments (or proposals thereof), modifications (or proposals
thereof), enforcement costs, documentary taxes or waivers of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby or thereby
contemplated shall be consummated). The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable
out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of its
rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in
connection with the Revolving Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Sheppard, Mullin,
Richter & Hampton LLP, counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent, and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection, the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any other counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, each Affiliate of
any of the foregoing persons and each of their respective directors, officers,
trustees, employees and agents (each such person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (i) any actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Revolving
Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit, (ii) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any
Indemnitee is a party thereto, or (iii) any actual or alleged presence or
Release of Hazardous Materials on any Real Property owned, leased or operated by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to
the Borrower or the Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such costs, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c)      The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term
of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Revolving Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the
expiration of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity or unenforceability of any
term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 9.05
shall be payable on written demand therefor accompanied by reasonable
documentation with respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount
requested.

         SECTION 9.06.     Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, except to the extent prohibited by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
other Loan

                                       98

<PAGE>

Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made
by such Lender (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application).

         SECTION 9.07.     APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL
LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

         SECTION 9.08.     Waivers; Amendment

                  (a)      No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or
right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other
Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall in and of itself entitle the
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may
be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided,
however, that no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or
extend the maturity of any scheduled principal payment date or date for the
payment of any interest on any Revolving Loan or any date for reimbursement of
an L/C Disbursement, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or
decrease the rate of interest on any Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement or
change the currency of any Revolving Loan or L/C Disbursement, without the prior
written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (ii) increase, decrease or
extend the Commitment (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all
Lenders) or decrease or extend the date for payment of the Commitment Fees of
any Lender or subject any Lender to any additional obligation, in each case
without the prior written consent of such Lender; (iii) amend or modify the
definition of "Borrowing Base", clause (l) of the definition of "Eligible
Accounts Receivable," clause (e) of the definition of "Eligible Inventory,"
Section 2.01, 2.12(a), the second sentence of Section 2.21(b) or Section
4.01(d), in each case without the prior written consent of each Lender; (iv)
amend or modify the pro rata requirements of Section 2.16, the provisions of
Section 9.04(j), the provisions of this Section 9.08, the

                                       99

<PAGE>

definition of the term "Required Lenders" or release any Guarantor (other than
in connection with a transaction permitted hereunder) or all or substantially
all of the Collateral, without the prior written consent of each Lender; or (v)
amend or modify the protections afforded to an SPC pursuant to the provisions of
Section 9.04(i) without the written consent of such SPC; provided, further, that
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder
or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Issuing Bank, respectively.

         SECTION 9.09.     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any
Revolving Loan or participation in any L/C Disbursement, together with all fees,
charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Revolving Loan
or participation in such L/C Disbursement under applicable law (collectively the
"Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may
be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding
such Revolving Loan or participation in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable in respect of such Revolving Loan or participation
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Revolving Loan or participation
but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.09 shall be
cumulated, and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of
other Revolving Loans or participations or periods shall be increased (but not
above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with
interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall have
been received by such Lender.

         SECTION 9.10.     Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Fee Letter and
the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract between the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof. Any other previous agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the
other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party
other than the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 9.11.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.11.

         SECTION 9.12.     Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby

                                      100

<PAGE>

(it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such
provision in any other jurisdiction). Any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision shall be deemed replaced with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions.

         SECTION 9.13.     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section
9.03. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart
of this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.14.     Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.15.     Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

                  (a)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any

                                     FORM OF
                   LANDLORD'S LIEN WAIVER AND ACCESS AGREEMENT

         THIS LANDLORD'S LIEN WAIVER AND ACCESS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of ____________, 2002 by and between ______________,
having an office at _________________________ ("Landlord") and Union Bank of
California, N.A., having an office at 350 California Street, 10th Floor, San
Francisco, California 94104, as collateral agent (in such capacity, "Agent") for
the benefit of the Lenders (as hereinafter defined) which are or may hereafter
become parties to the Credit Agreements (as hereinafter defined).

                                    RECITALS:

         A.       Landlord is the record title holder and owner of the real
property described in Schedule A attached hereto (the "Real Property").

         B.       Landlord has leased all or a portion of the Real Property (the
"Leased Premises") to Sola International Inc. ("Lessee") pursuant to a certain
lease agreement described in Schedule B attached hereto (as amended, amended and
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Lease").

         C.       Pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated as of October 28, 2002 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"; capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such
terms in the Credit Agreement), among Sola International Inc., as borrower
("Borrower"), the lending institutions (the "Lenders") from time to time party
thereto, UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA, N.A., as Sole Lead Arranger, as an Issuing
Bank, as Administrative Agent, and as Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders, the Lenders will agree to make to or for the account of Borrower
certain Loans.

         D.       As security for the payment and performance of the Obligations
under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Agent will acquire a
security interest in and lien upon all of Lessee's inventory and accounts
(together with all proceeds of the foregoing, collectively, the "Personal
Property").

         E.       Agent has requested that Landlord execute this Agreement as a
condition precedent to the making of the Loans under the Credit Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT:

         NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Landlord hereby represents, warrants and agrees in favor of Agent,
as follows:

<PAGE>

         1.       Subject to the last sentence of Section 4 below, Landlord
hereby waives and releases unto Agent (i) any contractual landlord's lien and
any other landlord's lien which it may be entitled to at law or in equity
against any Personal Property, (ii) any and all rights granted by or under any
present or future laws to levy or distrain for rent or any other charges which
may be due to the Landlord against the Personal Property and (iii) any and all
claims, liens and demands of every kind which it has or may hereafter have
against the Personal Property (including, without limitation, any right to
include the Personal Property in any secured financing Landlord may become party
to). Landlord acknowledges that the Personal Property is and will remain
personal property and not fixtures even though it may be affixed to or placed on
the Real Property.

         2.       Landlord certifies that (i) Landlord is the landlord under the
Lease described in Schedule B attached hereto, (ii) the Lease is in full force
and effect and has not been amended, modified or supplemented except as set
forth in Schedule B hereto, (iii) there is no defense, offset, claim or
counterclaim by or in favor of Landlord against Lessee under the Lease or
against the obligations of Landlord under the Lease and (iv) no notice of
default has been given under or in connection with the Lease which has not been
cured, and Landlord has no knowledge of any occurrence of any other default
under or in connection with the Lease.

         3.       Landlord agrees that Agent has the right to remove the
Personal Property from the Leased Premises at any time prior to the occurrence
of a default under the Lease and, after the occurrence of such a default, during
the Standstill Period (as hereinafter defined), provided that Agent shall repair
any damage arising from such removal. Landlord further agrees that, during the
foregoing periods, Landlord will not (i) remove any of the Personal Property
from the Leased Premises or (ii) hinder Agent's actions in removing Personal
Property from the Leased Premises or Agent's actions in otherwise enforcing its
security interest in the Personal Property. Agent shall not be liable for any
diminution in value of the Leased Premises caused by the absence of Personal
Property actually removed or by the need to replace the Personal Property after
such removal. Landlord acknowledges that Agent shall have no obligation to
remove the Personal Property from the Leased Premises.

         4.       Landlord acknowledges and agrees that Lessee's granting of a
security interest in the Personal Property in favor of the Agent (for its
benefit and the benefit of the Lenders) shall not constitute a default under the
Lease nor permit Landlord to terminate the Lease or re-enter or repossess the
Leased Premises or otherwise be the basis for the exercise of any remedy by
Landlord and Landlord hereby expressly consents to the granting of such security
interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or the Lease, in the event of a default by Lessee under the Lease, Landlord
agrees that (i) it shall provide to Agent at the address set forth in the
introductory paragraph hereof a copy of any notice of default delivered to
Lessee under the Lease and (ii) it shall not exercise any of its remedies
against Lessee provided in favor of Landlord under the Lease or at law or in
equity until the date which is 30 days after the date the Landlord delivers
written notice of such default to Agent (such 30-day period being referred to as
the "Standstill Period"). Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation,
during the Standstill Period, to cure such default and Landlord shall accept any
such cure by Agent or Lessee. If, during the Standstill Period, Agent or Lessee
or any other Person cures the default, then Landlord shall rescind the notice of
default. Landlord shall not, after the expiration of the Standstill Period,
terminate the Lease, or exercise any other remedies available to it thereunder
at

                                       2

law or in equity, so long as Agent (i) complies with all provisions of the
Lease requiring the payment or expenditure of money by Lessee, including,
without limitation, the payment of all (a) past due rent not later than the
expiration of the Standstill Period and (b) current rent on a timely basis as
and when the same becomes due and payable and (ii) cures any existing
nonmonetary defaults to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord within 60 days
of the end of the Standstill Period. If Agent fails to pay rent or to cure all
existing non-monetary defaults as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, the waiver and release set forth in Section 1 will be deemed null and
of no further force and effect and Landlord will be entitled to exercise all
rights and remedies that it may have under the Lease or applicable law against
Lessee and the Personal Property.

         5.       The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of Landlord
(including, without limitation, any successor owner of the Real Property) and
Agent.

         6.       All notices to any party hereto under this Agreement shall be
in writing and sent to such party at its respective address set forth above (or
at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice
to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 6) by
certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or by overnight
delivery service.

         7.       The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect
until Landlord shall have received Agent's written certification that the Loans
have been paid in full and all of Lessee's other Obligations under the Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been satisfied.

         8.       THE INTERPRETATION, VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

         9.       Landlord agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver such
further instruments as Agent may request to allow for the proper recording of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, a revised landlord's waiver in
form and substance sufficient for recording) or to otherwise accomplish the
purposes of this Agreement.

                                       3

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Agent have caused this Agreement to be

Exhibit 5 attached hereto (the "Existing Issuers") (in such capacities and
together with any successors in such capacities, the "Collateral Agent").

                                    RECITALS:

         A.       Pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of July 26,

Borrower certain Loans (as hereinafter defined) and to issue certain Letters of
Credit (as hereinafter defined) for the account of the Borrower.

         B.       It is contemplated that the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as

(collectively, the "Interest Rate Protection Agreements") with the Lenders or
their Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) fixing the interest rates with respect
to the Loans under the Credit Agreement.

         C.       It is contemplated that the Borrower or any Subsidiary of

rights, powers and remedies hereunder with respect to any Pledged Collateral
(including, without limitation, all actions necessary in the judgment of the
Collateral Agent to continue and confirm its security interest in the Pledged
Collateral in connection with the enactment of Revised Uniform Commercial Code
Article 9). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Pledgor shall

schedules, confirmatory assignments, supplements, additional security
agreements, conveyances, financing statements, transfer endorsements, powers of
attorney, certificates, reports and other assurances or instruments, all as may

Pledgors failing to promptly take such action requested, the Collateral Agent
may institute and maintain, in its own name or in the name of any Pledgor, such
suits and proceedings as the Collateral Agent may be advised by counsel shall be
necessary or expedient to prevent any

                                     -xvi-

Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in
and Lien upon the Pledged Collateral and shall not constitute or create a
present assignment of any of the Pledged Collateral.

         SECTION 4.10 Corporate Names; Prior Transactions. Such Pledgor has not,
during the past five years, been known by or used any other corporate or

Interests or any Pledgor's status as a partner or a member of any issuer of the

         SECTION 4.13 No Options, Warrants. etc. There are no options, warrants,
calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which such Pledgor

obligating such Pledgor to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which such Pledgor is a party with respect to
the transfer, voting or exercise of any other right of the equity interests of

         SECTION 4.14 No Claims. Such Pledgor owns or has rights to use all of
the Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder and all rights with respect to
any of the foregoing used in, necessary for or material to such Pledgor' s
business as currently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted pursuant to
the Loan Documents. The use by such Pledgor of such Pledged Collateral and all
such rights with respect to the foregoing do not infringe on the rights of any
Person, except for such infringement, violation or conflict which could not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been made
and remains outstanding that such Pledgor's use of any Pledged Collateral does
or may violate the rights of any third Person that would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 4.15 No Conflicts, Consents, etc. Neither the execution and
delivery hereof by each Pledgor nor the consummation of the transactions herein
contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof (i) violates any Operative
Agreement of such Pledgor or any issuer of Pledged Securities, (ii) violates the
terms of any agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, equipment lease,
instrument or other document to which such Pledgor is a party, or by which it
may be bound or to which any of its properties or assets may be subject, except
for such infringement, violation or conflict which could not be reasonably

limitation, equityholders or creditors of such Pledgor or any account debtor
under an Account) and no consent, authorization, approval, license or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
regulatory body or other Person is required for (A) the pledge by such Pledgor
of the Pledged Collateral pledged by it pursuant to this Agreement or for the
execution, delivery or performance hereof by such Pledgor, except as set forth
in Schedule 4.15 annexed hereto, (B) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the
voting or other rights provided for in this Agreement or (C) the exercise by the
Collateral Agent of the remedies in respect of the Pledged Collateral pursuant
to this Agreement. With respect to each consent, authorization, approval,
license or other action described in Schedule 4.15 annexed hereto, such Pledgor
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty with
respect thereto to deliver such consent, authorization, approval or license or
otherwise cause such other action to be taken within 30 days after the date
hereof; provided, however, that such Pledgor shall in no event be

                                      -xx-
<PAGE>
required to pay or cause to be paid any remuneration to any such counterparty in
order to obtain such consent, authorization, approval or licenses to the extent
that it would be commercially unreasonable so to do. In the event that the
Collateral Agent desires to exercise any remedies, voting or consensual rights
or attorney-in-fact powers set forth in this Agreement and determines it
necessary to obtain any approvals or consents of any Governmental Authority or
any other Person therefor, then, upon the reasonable request of the Collateral
Agent, such Pledgor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist
and aid the Collateral Agent to obtain as soon as practicable any necessary
approvals or consents for the exercise of any such remedies, rights and powers.

         SECTION 4.16 Pledged Collateral. All information set forth herein,
including the schedules annexed hereto, and all information contained in any
documents, schedules and lists heretofore delivered to any Secured Party in
connection with this Agreement, in each case, relating to the Pledged
Collateral, is accurate and complete in all material respects. The Pledged

property of such type of Pledged Collateral owned or held by the Pledgors.

         SECTION 4.17 Insurance; Condemnation.

         (i)      Required Insurance Policies and Coverages. No Pledgor shall

Agent's reasonable satisfaction against fire, theft and all other risks to which
the Pledged Collateral may be subject, in such amounts and with such deductibles
as would be maintained by a Prudent Operator or as the Collateral Agent may
otherwise require, including, without limitation, the following insurance
policies and coverages:

         (A)      physical hazard insurance on an "all risk" basis covering,
     without limitation, hazards commonly covered by fire and extended coverage,
     lightning, windstorm, civil commotion, hail, riot, strike, water damage,
     sprinkler leakage, collapse and malicious mischief, in an amount equal to
     the Full Replacement Cost of the Inventory;

         (B)      commercial general liability insurance against claims for
     bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about the
     Pledged Collateral, and covering any and all claims, including, without
     limitation, all legal liability to the extent insurable imposed upon the
     Collateral Agent and all court costs and attorneys' fees, arising out of or
     in connection with the possession, use or condition of the Pledged
     Collateral;

                                      -xxi-
<PAGE>
         (C)      explosion insurance in respect of any boilers, machinery and
     similar apparatus used in the production of, located near or otherwise
     effecting the Inventory;

         (D)      business interruption insurance;

         (E)      worker's compensation insurance as required by the laws of the
     state where the Pledged Collateral is located to protect such Pledgor and
     the Collateral Agent against claims for injuries sustained in the course of
     employment at the premises of such Pledgor; and

         (F)      such other insurance against risks as the Collateral Agent may
     from time to time reasonably require.

         (ii)     Required Form of Insurance Policies. Each Insurance Policy
described in clause (i) of this Section 4.17 shall provide that:

         (A)      it may not be modified, reduced, canceled or otherwise
     terminated without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the
     Collateral Agent;

         (B)      the Collateral Agent is permitted to pay any premium therefor
     within thirty (30) days after receipt of any notice stating that such
     premium has not been paid when due;

         (C)      all losses thereunder shall be payable notwithstanding any act
     or negligence of such Pledgor or its agents or employees which otherwise
     might have resulted in a forfeiture of all or a part of such insurance
     payments;

         (D)      to the extent such Insurance Policy constitutes Property
     Insurance relating to Inventory, all losses payable thereunder shall be
     payable to the Collateral Agent, as loss payee, pursuant to a standard
     non-contributory New York mortgagee endorsement and shall be in an amount
     at least sufficient to prevent coinsurance liability; and

         (E)      with respect to Liability Insurance, the Collateral Agent
     shall be named as an additional insured.

         (iii)    Settlements. Settlement of any claim under any of the Required
Insurance Policies, if such claim involves any loss in excess of $500,000 (in
the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Agent), shall require the prior
written approval of the Collateral Agent, and such Pledgor shall cause each such
policy to contain a provision to such effect.

         (iv)     Renewals. At least ten (10) days prior to the expiration of
any Required Insurance Policy, such Pledgor shall deliver to the Collateral
Agent a Required Insurance Policy or Policies renewing or extending such
expiring Required Insurance Policy or Policies, renewal or extension Insurance
Certificates or other reasonable evidence of renewal or extension providing that
the Insurance Policies are in full force and effect.

         (v)      Additional Insurance. Such Pledgor shall not purchase separate
insurance policies concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with
those Required Insurance

                                     -xxii-
<PAGE>
Policies required to be maintained under this Section 4.17, unless the
Collateral Agent is included thereon as an additional insured and, if
applicable, with loss payable to the Collateral Agent under an endorsement
containing the provisions described in clause (ii) of this Section 4.17. Such
Pledgor shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent whenever any such separate
insurance policy is obtained and shall promptly deliver to the Collateral Agent
the Required Insurance Policy or Insurance Certificate evidencing such
insurance.

         (vi)     Blanket Coverage. Such Pledgor may maintain the coverages
required by clause (i) of this Section 4.17 under blanket policies covering the
Pledged Collateral and other property owned or operated by such Pledgor or an
Affiliate of such Pledgor if the terms of such blanket policies otherwise comply
with the provisions of clause (i) of this Section 4.17 and contain specific
coverage allocations in respect of the Inventory complying with the provisions
of clause (i) of this Section 4.17.

         (vii)    Proceeds of Destructions and Taking.

         (A)      If there shall occur any Destruction in excess of $100,000.00,
     such Pledgor shall promptly send to the Collateral Agent a notice setting
     forth the nature and extent of such Destruction. If there shall occur any
     Taking, such Pledgor shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent upon
     receiving notice of such Taking or commencement of proceedings therefor.
     The Collateral Agent may participate in any proceedings or negotiations
     which might result in any Taking, and such Pledgor shall deliver or cause
     to be delivered to the Collateral Agent all instruments reasonably
     requested by it to permit such participation. The Collateral Agent may be
     represented by counsel satisfactory to it at the expense of such Pledgor in
     connection with any such participation. Such Pledgor shall pay all
     reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent in
     connection with any Taking and in seeking and obtaining any award or
     payment on account thereof. The Net Insurance Proceeds and Net Condemnation
     Awards are hereby assigned and shall be paid to the Collateral Agent. Such
     Pledgor shall take all steps necessary to notify the condemning authority
     of such assignment. All Net Insurance Proceeds and Net Condemnation Awards
     shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4.17(vii)(B)
     and 4.17(vii)(C).

         (B)      So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing, in the event there shall be a Net Condemnation Award or Net
     Insurance Proceeds in an amount less than $2,500,000, such Pledgor shall
     have the right, at such Pledgor's option, to apply such Net Condemnation
     Award or Net Insurance Proceeds to the payment of the Secured Obligations
     in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of the Credit Agreement
     or to perform a restoration (each, a "Restoration") of the Pledged
     Collateral. In the event such Pledgor elects to perform a Restoration, such
     Pledgor shall within thirty (30) days after the date that such Pledgor
     receives notice of collection by the Collateral Agent of the applicable
     Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Award, as the case may be,
     deliver to the Collateral Agent (1) a written notice of such election and
     (2) an Officers' Certificate stating that (a) the Net Insurance Proceeds or
     Net Condemnation Award, as the case may be, shall be utilized to perform a
     Restoration in the manner contemplated by this Section 4.17(vii)(B) and (b)
     no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (the items described in
     clauses (1) and (2)of this sentence,

                                     -xxiii-
<PAGE>
     collectively, the "Restoration Election Notice"). In the event the
     Collateral Agent does not receive a Restoration Election Notice within such
     30-day period, the Collateral Agent may apply any such Net Insurance
     Proceeds or Net Condemnation Award held by the Collateral Agent to the
     payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of
     Section 2.12(c) of the Credit Agreement. In the event such Pledgor elects
     to perform any Restoration contemplated by this Section 4.17(vii)(B), the
     Collateral Agent shall release such Net Condemnation Award or Net Insurance
     Proceeds to such Pledgor as soon as practicable following receipt of a
     Restoration Election Notice in accordance with the provisions of Section
     8.2(ii) hereof. Such Pledgor shall, within fifteen (15) days following the
     date of its receipt of any proceeds in respect of a Destruction or Taking,
     as the case may be, commence and diligently continue to perform the
     Restoration of that portion or portions of the Pledged Collateral subject
     to such Destruction or affected by such Taking so that, upon the completion
     of the Restoration, the Pledged Collateral will be in substantially the
     same condition and shall be of at least equal value and utility for its
     intended purposes as the Pledged Collateral was immediately prior to such
     Destruction or Taking. Such Pledgor shall so complete such Restoration with
     its own funds to the extent that the amount of any Net Condemnation Award
     or Net Insurance Proceeds is insufficient for such purpose.

         (C)      In the event there shall be a Net Condemnation Award or Net
     Insurance Proceeds in an amount equal to or greater than $2,500,000, the
     Collateral Agent shall have the option to apply such Net Condemnation Award
     or Net Insurance Proceeds, as the case may be, to the payment of the
     Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of
     the Credit Agreement or to require a Restoration of the Pledged Collateral.
     In the event a Restoration is to be performed under this Section
     4.17(vii)(C), the Collateral Agent shall not release any part of the Net
     Condemnation Award or Net Insurance Proceeds until such Pledgor has
     furnished to the Collateral Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth:
     (1) a brief description of the repair, rebuilding or replacement to be made
     and (2) the dollar amount of the expenditures to be made, or costs incurred
     by such Pledgor; provided, however, that such Pledgor shall so complete
     such Restoration with its own funds to the extent that the amount of any
     Net Condemnation Award or Net Insurance Proceeds is insufficient for such
     purpose.

         (D)      In the event that there shall be any surplus after application
     of the Net Condemnation Award or the Net Insurance Proceeds to Restoration
     of the Improvements, such surplus shall be applied as Net Cash Proceeds in
     accordance with Section 2.12 of the Credit Agreement.

         (viii)   Delivery After Foreclosure. In the event that the proceeds of
any insurance claim are paid after the Collateral Agent has exercised its right
to foreclose after an Event of Default, such proceeds shall be paid to the
Collateral Agent to satisfy any deficiency remaining after such foreclosure. The
Collateral Agent shall retain its interest in the Insurance Policies required to
be maintained pursuant to this Agreement during any redemption period.

         SECTION 4.18 Payment of Taxes; Compliance with Laws; Contesting
Liens; Claims. Each Pledgor represents and warrants that all Charges imposed
upon or assessed against the Pledged Collateral have been paid and discharged
except to the extent such Charges

                                     -xxiv-
<PAGE>
constitute a Lien not yet due and payable or constitute Contested Liens. Each
Pledgor shall pay prior to the date on which any penalties would attach thereto
all Charges against the Pledged Collateral. Each Pledgor shall comply with all
Requirements of Law applicable to the Pledged Collateral the failure to comply
with which would have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Pledgor may at its own expense contest the validity, amount or
applicability of any Charges pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the
Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 4.19 Access to Pledged Collateral, Books and Records; Other
Information. Upon reasonable notice to each Pledgor, the Collateral Agent, its
agents, accountants and attorneys shall have full and free access to visit and
inspect, as applicable, during normal business hours and such other reasonable
times as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent, all of the Pledged
Collateral including, without limitation, all of the books, correspondence and
records of such Pledgor relating thereto. The Collateral Agent and its
representatives may examine the same, take extracts therefrom and make
photocopies thereof, and such Pledgor agrees to render to the Collateral Agent,
at such Pledgor's cost and expense, such clerical and other assistance as may be
requested by the Collateral Agent with regard thereto. Such Pledgor shall, at
any and all times, within a reasonable time after written request by the
Collateral Agent, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Collateral Agent, in
such manner and in such detail as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral
Agent, additional information with respect to the Pledged Collateral.

and warranted that such Account and all records, papers and documents relating
thereto (i) are genuine and correct and in all material respects what they
purport to be, (ii) represent the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
account debtor, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability, evidencing amounts unpaid and owed by such account debtor,
arising out of the performance of labor or services or the sale or lease and
delivery of the merchandise listed therein or out of an advance or a loan, not
subject to the fulfillment of any contract or condition whatsoever or to any
defenses, set-offs or counterclaims except with respect to refunds, returns and
allowances in the ordinary course of business, or stamp or other taxes, (iii)
will, in the case of an Account, except for the original or duplicate original
invoice sent to a purchaser evidencing such purchaser's account, be the only
original writings evidencing and embodying such obligation of the account debtor
named therein and (iv) are in compliance and conform with all applicable
Federal, state and local laws and applicable laws of any relevant foreign
jurisdiction except where the failure to so comply or conform could not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.2 Maintenance of Records. Each Pledgor shall keep and
maintain at its own cost and expense complete records of each Account, in a
manner consistent with prudent business practice, including, without limitation,
records of all payments received, all credits

<PAGE>
granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all other documentation relating
thereto. Each Pledgor shall, at such Pledgor's sole cost and expense, upon the
Collateral Agent's demand made at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, deliver all tangible evidence of Accounts,
including, without limitation, all documents evidencing Accounts and any books
and records relating thereto, to the Collateral Agent or to its representatives
(copies of which evidence and books and records may be retained by such
Pledgor). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent may transfer a full and complete copy of any
Pledgor's books, records, credit information, reports, memoranda and all other
writings relating to the Accounts to and for the use by any Person that has
acquired or is contemplating acquisition of an interest in the Accounts or the
Collateral Agent's security interest therein without the consent of any Pledgor
but subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 5.3 Legend. Each Pledgor shall legend, at the request of the
Collateral Agent made at any time after the occurrence of any Event of Default
and in form and manner satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Accounts and
the other books, records and documents of such Pledgor evidencing or pertaining
to the Accounts with an appropriate reference to the fact that the Accounts have
been pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and
that the Collateral Agent has a security interest therein.

         SECTION 5.4 Modification of Terms, etc. No Pledgor shall rescind or
cancel any indebtedness evidenced by any Account or modify any term thereof or
make any adjustment with respect thereto except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with prudent business practice, or extend or renew any such

business practice or compromise or settle any dispute, claim, suit or legal
proceeding relating thereto except in the ordinary course of business consistent
with prudent business practice or sell any Account or interest therein without
the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent. Each Pledgor shall timely
fulfill all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in connection with
the Accounts.

         SECTION 5.5 Collection. Each Pledgor shall cause to be collected from
the account debtor of each of the Accounts, as and when due (including, without
limitation, Accounts that are delinquent, such Accounts to be collected in
accordance with generally accepted commercial collection procedures), any and
all amounts owing under or on account of such Account, and apply forthwith upon
receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance
of such Account, except that any Pledgor may, with respect to an Account, allow
in the ordinary course of business (i) a refund or credit due as a result of
returned or damaged or defective merchandise and (ii) such extensions of time to
pay amounts due in respect of Accounts and such other modifications of payment
terms or settlements in respect of Accounts as shall be commercially reasonable
in the circumstances, all in accordance with such Pledgor's ordinary course of
business consistent with its collection practices as in effect from time to
time. The costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) of
collection, in any case, whether incurred by any Pledgor and after an Event of
Default should have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent or any

         SECTION 5.6 Instruments. Each Pledgor shall deliver to the Collateral
Agent, within five days after receipt thereof by such Pledgor, any Instrument
evidencing Accounts which is in the principal amount of $50,000 or more. Any
Instrument delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall
be appropriately endorsed (if applicable) to the order of the Collateral Agent,
as agent for the Secured Parties, and shall be held by the Collateral Agent as
further security hereunder; provided, however, that so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent shall,
promptly upon request of such Pledgor, make appropriate arrangements for making
any Instrument pledged by such Pledgor available to such Pledgor for purposes of
presentation, collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected, to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent, against trust receipt or like
document).

         SECTION 5.7 Payment into Lockboxes. After the occurrence of a Default
and upon the request of the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor shall cause all
payments in respect of the Accounts to be deposited into Lockboxes and otherwise
comply with the provisions of Section 8.4 hereof. The costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of collection,
whether incurred by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party, shall be paid by
the Pledgors.

                                   ARTICLE VI

               CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING SECURITIES COLLATERAL

         SECTION 6.1 Pledge of Additional Securities Collateral. Each Pledgor
shall, upon obtaining any Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes of any Person
required to be Pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders
pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.11 of the Credit Agreement or this
Agreement, accept the same in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and
promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) deliver to the Collateral
Agent a pledge amendment, duly executed by such Pledgor, in substantially the
form of Exhibit 2 annexed hereto (each, a "Pledge Amendment"), and the
certificates and other documents required under Section 3.1 and Section 3.2
hereof in respect of the additional Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes
which are to be pledged pursuant to this Agreement or the Credit Agreement, and
confirming the attachment of the Lien hereby created on and in respect of such
additional Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes. Each Pledgor hereby
authorizes the Collateral Agent to attach each Pledge Amendment to this
Agreement and agrees that all Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes listed on
any Pledge Amendment delivered to the Collateral Agent shall for all purposes
hereunder be considered Pledged Collateral.

         SECTION 6.2 Voting Rights; Distributions, etc.

         (i)      So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

         (A)      Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting
     and other consensual rights pertaining to the Securities Collateral or any
     part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms or purposes
     hereof or any other Loan Document; provided, however, that no Pledgor shall
     in any event exercise such rights in any manner

                                     -xxvii-
<PAGE>
     which may have an adverse effect on the value of the Pledged Collateral or
     the Lien and security interest intended to be granted to the Collateral
     Agent hereunder.

         (B)      Each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain, and to
     utilize free and clear of the Lien hereof, any and all Distributions, but
     only if and to the extent made in accordance with the provisions of the
     Credit Agreement; provided, however, that any and all such Distributions
     consisting of rights or interests in the form of securities shall be
     forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent to hold as Pledged Collateral
     and shall, if received by any Pledgor, be received in trust for the benefit
     of the Collateral Agent, be segregated from the other property or funds of
     such Pledgor and be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent as Pledged
     Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary
     endorsement); provided, further, however, that no Pledgor shall be so
     required to pledge any Distributions consisting of rights or interests in
     the form of securities if such pledge shall result in the Collateral Agent
     possessing more than 65% of the voting power of all classes of capital
     stock entitled to vote of any Subsidiary which is a controlled foreign
     corporation (as defined in Section 957(a) of the Tax Code) or would
     constitute an investment of earnings in United States property under
     Section 956 (or a successor provision) of the Tax Code, which investment
     would trigger an increase in the gross income of a United States
     shareholder of such Pledgor pursuant to Section 951 (or a successor
     provision) of the Tax Code.

         (C)      The Collateral Agent shall be deemed without further action or
     formality to have granted to each Pledgor all necessary consents relating
     to voting rights and shall, if necessary, upon written request of any
     Pledgor and at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors, from time to time
     execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to such Pledgor
     all such instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request in order to
     permit such Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights which it is
     entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 6.2(i)(A) hereof and to receive
     the Distributions which it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to
     Section 6.2(i)(B) hereof.

         (ii)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default:

         (A)      All rights of each Pledgor to exercise the voting and other
     consensual rights it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to
     Section 6.2(i)(A) hereof without any action or the giving of any notice
     shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the
     Collateral Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise
     such voting and other consensual rights.

         (B)      All rights of each Pledgor to receive Distributions which it
     would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section
     6.2(i)(B) hereof shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon become
     vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right
     to receive and hold as Pledged Collateral such Distributions; provided,
     however, that no Pledgor shall be so required to pledge any Distributions
     consisting or rights of interest in the form of securities if such pledge
     shall result in the Collateral Agent possessing more than 65% of the voting
     power of all classes of capital stock entitled to vote of any Subsidiary
     which is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in Section 957(a) of
     the Tax Code) or would constitute an

                                    -xxviii-
<PAGE>
     investment of earnings in United States property under Section 956 (or a
     successor provision) of the Tax Code, which investment would trigger an
     increase in the gross income of a United States shareholder of such Pledgor
     pursuant to Section 951 (or a successor provision) of the Tax Code.

         (iii)    Each Pledgor shall, at its sole cost and expense, from time to
time execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent appropriate instruments as the
Collateral Agent may request in order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise
the voting and other rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant to
Section 6.2(ii)(A) hereof and to receive all Distributions which it may be
entitled to receive under Section 6.2(ii)(B) hereof.

         (iv)     All Distributions which are received by any Pledgor contrary
to the provisions of Section 6.2(ii)(B) hereof shall be received in trust for
the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of
such Pledgor and shall immediately be paid over to the Collateral Agent as
Pledged Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement).

         SECTION 6.3 No New Securities. Except to the extent otherwise permitted
under Article IX hereof, each Pledgor shall cause each issuer of the Pledged
Securities not to issue any stock or other securities or equity interests in
addition to or in substitution for the Pledged Securities issued by such issuer,
except to such Pledgor.

         SECTION 6.4 Operative Agreements. Each Pledgor has delivered to the
Collateral Agent true, correct and complete copies of the Operative Agreements.
The Operative Agreements are in full force and effect, have not as of the date
hereof been amended or modified except as disclosed to the Collateral Agent, and
there is no existing default by any party thereunder or any event which, with
the giving of notice of passage of time or both, would constitute a default by
any party thereunder. Each Pledgor shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a copy
of any notice of default given or received by it under any Operative Agreement
within ten days after such Pledgor gives or receives such notice. No Pledgor
will terminate or agree to terminate any Operative Agreement or make any
amendment or modification to any Operative Agreement which may have an adverse
effect on the value of the Pledged Securities and Distributions relating thereto
or the Lien and security intended to be granted to the Collateral Agent
hereunder.

         SECTION 6.5 Defaults, etc. Such Pledgor is not in default in the
payment of any portion of any mandatory capital contribution, if any, required
to be made under any agreement to which such Pledgor is a party relating to the
Pledged Securities pledged by it, and such Pledgor is not in violation of any
other provisions of any such agreement to which such Pledgor is a party, or
otherwise in default or violation thereunder. No Securities Collateral pledged
by such Pledgor is subject to any defense, offset or counterclaim, which have
been asserted or alleged against such Pledgor by any Person with respect
thereto, and as of the date hereof, there are no certificates, instruments,
documents or other writings (other than the Operative Agreements and
certificates, if any, delivered to the Collateral Agent) which evidence any
Pledged Securities of such Pledgor.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                          CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING
                  COLLATERAL ACCOUNT AND COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS

         SECTION 8.1 [Intentionally Omitted].

         SECTION 8.2 Collateral Account.

         (i)      Deposits into Collateral Account. Each Pledgor shall deposit
into the Collateral Account from time to time (A) after the occurrence of a
Default, the cash proceeds of any of the Pledged Collateral (including pursuant
to any disposition thereof), (B) after the occurrence of a Default, the cash
proceeds of any Taking or Destruction or loss of title with respect to any
Pledged Collateral, (C) any cash in respect of any Pledged Collateral to which
the Collateral Agent is entitled pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof, (D) such
amounts that such Pledgor is required to pledge as additional collateral
security hereunder pursuant to the Loan Documents and (E) any other amounts that
such Pledgor desires to pledge to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties as additional collateral security hereunder.

         (ii)     Application of Amounts in Collateral Account. The balance from
time to time in the Collateral Account shall constitute part of the Pledged
Collateral hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Secured Obligations
until applied as hereinafter provided. So long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or will result therefrom, the Collateral Agent shall
within two Business Days of receiving a request of such Pledgor for release of
cash proceeds from the Collateral Account remit the cash proceeds on deposit in
the Collateral Account to or upon the order of such Pledgor, in periodic
installments, if applicable, so long as such Pledgor has with respect to any
Pledged Collateral, satisfied the conditions relating thereto set forth in
Section 4.17(vii) hereof. At any time following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed
by the Lenders as specified in the Credit Agreement, shall) in its (or their)
discretion apply or cause to be applied (subject to collection) the balance from
time to time outstanding to the credit of the Collateral Account to the payment
of the Secured Obligations in the manner specified in Article XI hereof subject,
however, in the case of amounts deposited in the L/C Sub-Account, to the
provisions of Section 8.3 hereof. The balance from time to time in the
Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided herein.

         (iii)    Investment of Balance in Collateral Account. Amounts on
deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested from time to time in such
Cash Equivalents as the respective Pledgor (or, after the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent) shall determine,
which Cash Equivalents shall be held in the name and be under the control of the
Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent); provided, however, that at any time

                                      -xxx-
<PAGE>
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed by the Lenders as specified in the
Credit Agreement, shall) in its (or their) discretion at any time and from time
to time elect to liquidate any such Cash Equivalents and to apply or cause to be
applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations in the
manner specified in Article XI hereof.

         SECTION 8.3 Cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities. Amounts deposited
into the Collateral Account as cover for liabilities in respect of Letters of
Credit under the Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 2.21 thereof shall be held
by the Collateral Agent in a separate sub-account designated as the "L/C
Sub-Account" (the "L/C Sub-Account") and, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, all amounts held in the L/C Sub-Account shall constitute
collateral security first for the liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit
outstanding from time to time and second as collateral security for the other
Secured Obligations hereunder until such time as all Letters of Credit shall
have been terminated and all of the liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit
have been paid in full.

         SECTION 8.4 Collection of Accounts.

         (i)      Lockboxes. After the occurrence of a Default and upon the
request of the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor shall establish one or more
lockboxes (the "Lockboxes") with a Lockbox Bank and shall irrevocably instruct
all account debtors on all of the Accounts of such Pledgor, all agents for the
collection of Accounts and all issuers or obligors under letters of credit or
other documents supporting Accounts to remit all Collections to such Lockboxes.
Each Pledgor, the Collateral Agent and each of the financial institutions
selected by such Pledgor and reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent
(each, a "Lockbox Bank" and, collectively, the "Lockbox Banks") shall enter into
Lockbox Agreements, which among other things shall provide for the opening of an
account for the deposit of Collections (each, a "Collection Account" and,
collectively, the "Collection Accounts") at a Lockbox Bank. Each Pledgor shall
maintain separate and distinct Lockboxes and Collection Accounts and the
Lockboxes and Collection Accounts of each Pledgor will be clearly identified as
the Lockbox and Collection Accounts of such Pledgor and no other Person,
including no other Pledgor. Such amounts shall be so deposited on a daily basis.
All Collections and other amounts received by or on behalf of each such Pledgor
from any account debtor, agent or credit support party shall be held in trust
for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be deposited into the
Collection Account of such Pledgor within one Business Day after such Pledgor's
receipt thereof. Such arrangements shall not be modified or terminated without
the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent.

         (ii)     Lockbox Concentration Account. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Lockbox Agreements, all good funds held in each
Collection Account shall be wired each Business Day into a separate account for
each such Pledgor (each, a "Lockbox Concentration Account") maintained by the
Collateral Agent. Each Pledgor shall accurately report all amounts deposited in
the Collection Accounts to ensure the proper transfer of funds as set forth
above. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that, (A) pursuant to the Lockbox
Agreements executed and delivered by such Pledgor it has irrevocably directed
the Lockbox Banks to transfer no later than [2:00 p.m.] (California time) each
Business Day all available funds, investments, money, cash, Instruments,
securities, rights, Proceeds and other property and amounts contained in their
respective Collection Accounts into the Lockbox

                                     -xxxi-
<PAGE>
Concentration Account established for such Pledgor hereunder and (B) the
Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control of the Lockbox
Concentration Accounts. If any Pledgor receives directly any remittance or
payments notwithstanding the arrangements for payments directly into Collection
Accounts (as provided for in the Lockbox Agreements), such Pledgor shall hold
such remittance and payments in trust for the Collateral Agent, and shall
deposit such amounts into its respective Lockbox Concentration Account within
one Business Day after such Pledgor's receipt thereof.

         (iii)    Dispositions from Lockbox Concentration Account. After an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and with the approval of
the Collateral Agent acting at the direction of the Required Lenders (which
approval may be granted or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the
Required Lenders), each Pledgor is hereby authorized by the Collateral Agent to
direct on any Business Day the disposition of any and all moneys, financial
assets, checks, drafts, securities, instruments and other property deposited in
its Lockbox Concentration Account into one or more deposit accounts for use by
such Pledgor in a manner permitted by the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent
shall make such disposition by [2:00 p.m.] California time on each such date.

         (iv)     Revocation of Withdrawal Right. Upon the occurrence and during
continuance of any Event of Default and revocation by the Collateral Agent
acting at the direction of the Required Lenders (which revocation may be made in
the sole and absolute discretion of the Required Lenders), the authorization of
the Pledgors under Section 8.4(iii) shall be revoked and all deposits maintained
in the Lockbox Concentration Accounts, and any additional moneys and other
property subsequently maintained with any Lockbox Bank, shall be transferred to
the Collateral Account. All such deposits in the Collateral Account shall be
held by the Collateral Agent as Pledged Collateral for the Secured Obligations
or applied to the payment of the Secured Obligations in accordance with Article
XI hereof. The costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) of collection,
whether incurred by any Pledgor or the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent),
shall be borne by the Pledgors.

         SECTION 8.5 Restriction on Credit Balances in Deposit Accounts. The
Pledgors shall not at any time deposit or cause to be deposited into any
account, except as otherwise specifically permitted pursuant to the provisions
of this Article VIII, any funds, investments, money, cash, instruments,
securities, rights, proceeds and other property and amounts received by or on
behalf of the Pledgors from any Account; provided, however, that so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgors may deposit
or cause to be deposited into such account such funds, investments, money, cash,
instruments, securities, rights, proceeds and other property and amounts
received by or on behalf of the Pledgors so long as the aggregate sum thereof
shall in no event exceed at any time $500,000; provided, further, that all
amounts in excess of $500,000 shall be deposited directly into the Collection
Account of the applicable Pledgor or the Collateral Account in accordance with
the provisions of this Article VIII.

                            TRANSFERS AND OTHER LIENS

         No Pledgor shall (i) sell, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
grant any option with respect to, any of the Pledged Collateral pledged by it
hereunder except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, (ii) create or permit to
exist any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Pledged Collateral pledged by
it hereunder other than Permitted Liens or (iii) permit any issuer of the
Pledged Securities to merge, consolidate or change its legal form, unless (A)
such entity is organized in a jurisdiction outside the United States and 65% of
all of the outstanding equity interests of the surviving or resulting entity
are, upon such merger or consolidation, pledged hereunder and any cash,
securities or other property is distributed in respect of the outstanding equity
interests of any other entity that was merged into or consolidated with such
issuer is deposited in the Collateral Account and (B) such Pledgor shall have
complied with the applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 10.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may from time to time exercise in
respect of the Pledged Collateral, in addition to the other rights and remedies
provided for herein or otherwise available to it:

         (i)      Personally, or by agents or attorneys, reasonably and
immediately take possession of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof, from
any Pledgor or any other Person who then has possession of any part thereof with
or without notice or process of law, and for that purpose may enter upon any
Pledgor's premises where any of the Pledged Collateral is located, remove such
Pledged Collateral, remain present at such premises to receive copies of all
communications and remittances relating to the Pledged Collateral and use in
connection with such removal and possession any and all services, supplies, aids
and other facilities of any Pledgor;

         (ii)     Demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at
any time payable or receivable in respect of the Pledged Collateral including,
without limitation, instructing the obligor or obligors on any agreement,
instrument or other obligation constituting part of the Pledged Collateral to
make any payment required by the terms of such agreement, instrument or other
obligation directly to the Collateral Agent, and in connection with any of the
foregoing, compromise, settle, extend the time for payment and make other
modifications with respect thereto; provided, however, that in the event that
any such payments are made directly to any Pledgor, prior to receipt by any such
obligor of such instruction, such Pledgor shall segregate all amounts received
pursuant thereto in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall
promptly (but in no event later than one Business Day after receipt thereof)
deposit such amounts into the Collateral Account;

                                    -xxxiii-
<PAGE>
         (iii)    Sell, assign, grant a license to use or otherwise liquidate,
or direct any Pledgor to sell, assign, grant a license to use or otherwise
liquidate, any and all investments made in whole or in part with the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof, and take possession of the proceeds of any such
sale, assignment, license or liquidation;

         (iv)     Take possession of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof,
by directing any Pledgor in writing to deliver the same to the Collateral Agent
at any place or places within the continental United States so designated by the
Collateral Agent, in which event such Pledgor shall at its own expense: (A)
forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places designated by the
Collateral Agent and there delivered to the Collateral Agent, (B) store and keep
any Pledged Collateral so delivered to the Collateral Agent at such place or
places pending further action by the Collateral Agent and (C) while the Pledged
Collateral shall be so stored and kept, provide such security and maintenance
services as shall be reasonably necessary to protect the same and to preserve
and maintain them in good condition. Each Pledgor's obligation to deliver the
Pledged Collateral as contemplated in this Section l0.l(iv) is of the essence
hereof. Upon application to a court of equity having jurisdiction, the
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to a decree requiring specific performance by
any Pledgor of such obligation;

         (v)      Withdraw all moneys, instruments, securities and other
property in any Bank Account or other account of any Pledgor pledged to the
Collateral Agent hereunder (including, without limitation, the accounts
contemplated in Article VIII and/or Section 3.4 hereof) for application to the
Secured Obligations as provided in Article XI hereof;

         (vi)     Retain and apply the Distributions to the Secured Obligations
as provided in Article XI hereof;

         (vii)    Exercise any and all rights as beneficial and legal owner of
the Pledged Collateral, including, without limitation, perfecting assignment of
and exercising any and all voting, consensual and other rights and powers with
respect to any Pledged Collateral; and

         (viii)   All the rights and remedies of a secured party on default
under the UCC, and the Collateral Agent may also in its sole discretion, without
notice except as specified in Section 10.2 hereof, sell, assign or grant a
license to use the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels
at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at any of the
Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
delivery, and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the
Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party or any of their respective Affiliates may be the purchaser,
licensee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Pledged Collateral at any
such sale and shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making
settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Pledged Collateral sold, assigned or licensed at such sale, to use and apply any
of the Secured Obligations owed to such Person as a credit on account of the
purchase price of any Pledged Collateral payable by such Person at such sale.
Each purchaser, assignee, licensee or recipient at any such sale shall acquire
the property sold, assigned or licensed absolutely free from any claim or right
on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which
it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or
statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Collateral Agent shall not be
obligated to make

                                     -xxxiv-
<PAGE>
any sale of Pledged Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each
Pledgor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims
against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at
which any Pledged Collateral may have been sold, assigned or licensed at such a
private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public
sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and does not
offer such Pledged Collateral to more than one offeree.

         SECTION 10.2 Notice of Sale. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees
that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, ten days' notice to
such Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which
any private sale or other intended disposition is to take place shall be
commercially reasonable notification of such matters. No notification need be
given to any Pledgor if it has signed, after the occurrence of an Event of
Default, a statement renouncing or modifying any right to notification of sale
or other intended disposition.

         SECTION 10.3 Waiver of Notice and Claims. Each Pledgor hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notice or judicial hearing in
connection with the Collateral Agent's taking possession or the Collateral
Agent's disposition of any of the Pledged Collateral, including, without
limitation, any and all prior notice and hearing for any prejudgment remedy or
remedies and any such right which such Pledgor would otherwise have under law,
and each Pledgor hereby further waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law: (i) all damages occasioned by such taking of possession, (ii)
all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of sale or other
requirements with respect to the enforcement of the Collateral Agent's rights
hereunder and (iii) all rights of redemption, appraisal, valuation, stay,
extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable law. The
Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any incorrect or improper payment made
pursuant to this Article X in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other
realization upon, any Pledged Collateral shall operate to divest all right,
title, interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the applicable
Pledgor therein and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in
equity against such Pledgor and against any and all Persons claiming or
attempting to claim the Pledged Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon,
or any part thereof, from, through or under such Pledgor.

         SECTION 10.4 Certain Sales of Pledged Collateral.

         (i)      Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in law, rules, regulations or orders of any Governmental
Authority, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of
all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who meet
the requirements of such Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor acknowledges that
any such sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Collateral
Agent than those obtainable though a public sale without such restrictions, and,
notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such restricted sale shall
be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that, except
as may be required by applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall have no
obligation to engage in public sales.

                                     -xxxv-
<PAGE>
         (ii)     Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), and applicable state securities laws, the Collateral Agent
may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Securities
Collateral, to limit purchasers to Persons who will agree, among other things,
to acquire such Securities Collateral for their own account, for investment and
not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges
that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the
Collateral Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such
restrictions (including, without limitation, a public offering made pursuant to
a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been
made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent shall
have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale
of any Securities Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the
issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale requiring registration
under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, even if such
issuer would agree to do so.

         (iii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Pledgor shall, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the request of
the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, cause any
registration, qualification under or compliance with any Federal or state
securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the
Securities Collateral as soon as practicable and at the sole cost and expense of
the Pledgors. Each Pledgor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be
effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or
facilitate the sale and distribution of such Securities Collateral including,
without limitation, registration under the Securities Act (or any similar
statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or
other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with all other
requirements of any Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor shall cause the
Collateral Agent to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such
registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof,
shall furnish to the Collateral Agent such number of prospectuses, offering
circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Collateral Agent from time
to time may request, and shall indemnify and shall cause the issuer of the
Securities Collateral to indemnify the Collateral Agent and all others
participating in the distribution of such Securities Collateral against all
claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any
related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement,
notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

         (iv)     If the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its right to
sell any or all of the Securities Collateral, upon written request, the
applicable Pledgor shall from time to time furnish to the Collateral Agent all
such information as the Collateral Agent may request in order to determine the
number of securities included in the Securities Collateral which may be sold by
the Collateral Agent as exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from
time to time in effect.

         SECTION 10.5 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

         (i)      No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent to exercise, no
course of dealing with respect to, and no delay on the part of the Collateral
Agent in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power
or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy; nor shall the Collateral Agent be
required to look first to, enforce or exhaust any other security, collateral or
guaranties. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any remedies provided by law.

         (ii)     In the event that the Collateral Agent shall have instituted
any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Agreement by
foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Collateral Agent, then and in every such case, the Pledgors, the
Collateral Agent and each other Secured Party shall be restored to their
respective former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Pledged
Collateral, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Collateral Agent and the
other Secured Parties shall continue as if no such proceeding had been
instituted.

         SECTION 10.6 [Intentionally Omitted].

                                   ARTICLE XI

                             APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

         The proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale
of, collection from or other realization upon all or any part of the Pledged
Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its remedies as a
secured creditor as provided in Article X hereof shall be applied, together with
any other sums then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement,
promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows:

         FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses, fees, commissions and
     taxes of such sale, collection or other realization including, without
     limitation, the costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent and its agents
     and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by
     the Collateral Agent in connection therewith, together with interest on
     each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under the Credit
     Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until
     paid in full;

         SECOND, to the payment of all other costs and expenses of such sale,
     collection or other realization including, without limitation, the costs
     and expenses of the Lenders and their agents and counsel and all costs,
     liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Lenders in connection
     therewith, together with interest on each such amount at the highest rate
     then in effect under the Credit Agreement from and after the date such
     amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in full;

         THIRD, without duplication of amounts applied pursuant to clauses FIRST
     and SECOND above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash, pro rata, of
     (i) interest, principal and other amounts constituting Secured Obligations
     (other than the obligations

                                    -xxxvii-
<PAGE>
     arising under the Interest Rate Protection Agreements, the Hedging
     Agreements and the Cash Management Agreements) in accordance with the terms
     of the Credit Agreement and (ii) the obligations arising under the Interest
     Rate Protection Agreements, the Hedging Agreements and the Cash Management
     Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Interest Rate Protection
     Agreements, the Hedging Agreements and the Cash Management Agreements, as
     applicable; and

         FOURTH, the balance, if any, to the Person lawfully entitled thereto
     (including the Pledgors or their respective successors or assigns).

         In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the
items described in clauses FIRST though THIRD of this Article XI, the Pledgors
shall remain liable for any deficiency.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 12.1 Concerning Collateral Agent.

         (i)      The Collateral Agent has been appointed as Collateral Agent
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Collateral Agent hereunder
are subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent
shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or
refrain from, exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action
(including, without limitation, the release or substitution of the Pledged
Collateral), in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement. The
Collateral Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith
and shall not be liable for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith. The Collateral Agent may resign
and a successor Collateral Agent may be appointed in the manner provided in the
Credit Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Collateral Agent
by a successor Collateral Agent, that successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement, and the retiring
Collateral Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation, the
provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was the Collateral Agent.

         (ii)     The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its
possession if such Pledged Collateral is accorded treatment substantially
equivalent to that which the Collateral Agent, in its individual capacity,
accords its own property consisting of property of a similar kind and nature as
the Pledged Collateral, it being understood that neither the Collateral Agent
nor any of the Secured Parties shall have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or
taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders
or other matters relating to any Securities Collateral, whether or not the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge
of such matters, or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against
any Person with respect to any Pledged Collateral.

                                   -xxxviii-
<PAGE>
         (iii)    The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone
message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel
selected by it.

         (iv)     With respect to any of its rights and obligations as a Lender,
Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers
hereunder. The term "Lenders," "Lender" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include Collateral Agent in its individual
capacity as a Lender. Collateral Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with such
Pledgor or any Affiliate of such Pledgor to the same extent as if Collateral
Agent were not acting as collateral agent.

         (v)      If any item of Pledged Collateral also constitutes collateral
granted to Collateral Agent under any other deed of trust, mortgage, security
agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of any conflict
between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed of trust,
mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in respect of
such collateral, Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion, shall select which
provision or provisions shall control.

         SECTION 12.2 Collateral Agent May Perform; Collateral Agent Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact. If any Pledgor shall fail to perform any covenants contained
in this Agreement, (including, without limitation, such Pledgor's covenants to
(i) pay the premiums in respect of all required insurance policies hereunder,
(ii) pay Charges, (iii) make repairs, (iv) discharge Liens or (v) pay or perform
any obligations of such Pledgor under any Pledged Collateral) or if any warranty
on the part of any Pledgor contained herein shall be breached, after an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such
breach, and may expend funds for such purpose; provided, however, that
Collateral Agent shall in no event be bound to inquire into the validity of any
tax, lien, imposition or other obligation which such Pledgor fails to pay or
perform as and when required hereby and which such Pledgor does not contest in
accordance in accordance with the provision of Section 4.18 hereof. Any and all
amounts so expended by the Collateral Agent shall be paid by the Pledgors in
accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3 hereof. Neither the provisions of
this Section 12.2 nor any action taken by Collateral Agent pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 12.2 shall prevent any such failure to observe any
covenant contained in this Agreement nor any breach of warranty from
constituting an Event of Default. After an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Pledgor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent its
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and
in the name of such Pledgor, or otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral
Agent's discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument consistent
with the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents which the Collateral Agent
may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof. The foregoing
grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled with an interest and such
appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof. Each Pledgor hereby
ratifies all that such attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof.

                                     -xxxix-
<PAGE>
         SECTION 12.3 Expenses. Each Pledgor will upon demand pay to the
Collateral Agent the amount of any and all reasonable costs and expenses,
including the fees and expenses of its counsel and the fees and expenses of any
experts and agents which the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (i)
any action, suit or other proceeding affecting the Pledged Collateral or any
part thereof commenced, in which action, suit or proceeding the Collateral Agent
is made a party or participates or in which the right to use the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof is threatened, or in which it becomes necessary
in the judgment of the Collateral Agent to defend or uphold the Lien hereof
(including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding to establish or
uphold the compliance of the Pledged Collateral with any requirements of any
Governmental Authority or law), (ii) the collection of the Secured Obligations,
(iii) the enforcement and administration hereof, (iv) the custody or
preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any
of the Pledged Collateral, (v) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights
of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party hereunder or (vi) the failure by
any Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. All amounts
expended by the Collateral Agent and payable by any Pledgor under this Section
12.3 shall be due upon demand therefor (together with interest thereon accruing
at the Default Rate during the period from and including the date on which such
funds were so expended to the date of repayment) and shall be part of the
Secured Obligations. Each Pledgor's obligations under this Section 12.3 shall
survive the termination hereof and the discharge of such Pledgor's other
obligations under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any Interest Rate
Protection Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the Cash Management Agreements and
the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 12.4 Indemnity.

         (i)      Indemnity. Each Pledgor agrees to indemnify, pay and hold
harmless the Collateral Agent and each of the other Secured Parties and the
officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates of the Collateral Agent
and each of the other Secured Parties (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs (including, without limitation,
settlement costs), expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, commenced or threatened, whether or not such Indemnitee
shall be designated a party thereto) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against that Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out
hereof, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the Cash
Management Agreements or any other Loan Document (including, without limitation,
any misrepresentation by any Pledgor in this Agreement, any Interest Rate
Protection Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the Cash Management Agreements or
any other Loan Document) (the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however,
that no Pledgor shall have any obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with
respect to Indemnified Liabilities if it has been determined by a final
non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Liabilities arose from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
that Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is
violative of any law or public policy, each Pledgor shall contribute the maximum
portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the
payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the
Indemnitees or any of them.

                                      -xl-
<PAGE>
         (ii)     Survival. The obligations of the Pledgors contained in this
Section 12.4 shall survive the termination hereof and the discharge of the
Pledgors' other obligations under this Agreement, any Interest Rate Protection
Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the Cash Management Agreements and under the
other Loan Documents.

         (iii)    Reimbursement. Any amounts paid by any Indemnitee as to which
such Indemnitee has the right to reimbursement shall constitute Secured
Obligations secured by the Pledged Collateral.

         SECTION 12.5 Continuing Security Interest; Assignment. This Agreement
shall create a continuing security interest in the Pledged Collateral and shall
(i) be binding upon the Pledgors, their respective successors and assigns and
(ii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent
hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties
and each of their respective successors, transferees and assigns. No other
Persons (including, without limitation, any other creditor of any Pledgor) shall
have any interest herein or any right or benefit with respect hereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (ii) and subject to the terms of
the Credit Agreement, any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any
indebtedness held by it secured by this Agreement to any other Person, and such
other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect
thereof granted to such Lender, herein or otherwise, subject however, to the
provisions of the Credit Agreement and any applicable Interest Rate Protection
Agreement, the Hedging Agreements or the Cash Management Agreements.

         SECTION 12.6 Termination; Release. When all the Secured Obligations
have been paid in full and the Commitments of the Lenders to make any Loan or to
issue any Letter of Credit under the Credit Agreement shall have expired or been
sooner terminated, this Agreement shall terminate. Upon termination hereof or
any release of Pledged Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, upon the request and at the sole
cost and expense of the Pledgors, forthwith assign, transfer and deliver to
Pledgor, against receipt and without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral
Agent, such of the Pledged Collateral to be released (in the case of a release)
as may be in possession of the Collateral Agent and as shall not have been sold
or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof, and, with respect to any
other Pledged Collateral, proper documents and instruments (including UCC-3
termination statements or releases) acknowledging the termination hereof or the
release of such Pledged Collateral, as the case may be.

         SECTION 12.7 Modification in Writing. No amendment, modification,
supplement, termination or waiver of or to any provision hereof, nor consent to
any departure by any Pledgor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall
be made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and unless in
writing and signed by the Collateral Agent. Any amendment, modification or
supplement of or to any provision hereof, any waiver of any provision hereof and
any consent to any departure by any Pledgor from the terms of any provision
hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is specifically required by
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand on any Pledgor
in any case shall entitle any Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances.

         SECTION 12.8 Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein or in the Credit
Agreement, any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be
given shall be given in the manner and become effective as set forth in the
Credit Agreement, as to any Pledgor, addressed to it at the address of the
Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement and as to the Collateral Agent,
addressed to it at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement, or in each
case at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this
Section 12.8.

         SECTION 12.9 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS EXCEPT TO
THE GREATEST EXTENT THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST
HEREUNDER, OR REMEDIES HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR ITEM OR TYPE OF
PLEDGED COLLATERAL, ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

         SECTION 12.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST ANY PLEDGOR WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY CALIFORNIA STATE COURT OR FEDERAL COURT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, AND ANY
APPELLATE COURT OF ANY THEREOF, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY HEREOF, EACH
PLEDGOR ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PLEDGOR AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY
PROCEEDING MAY BE EFFECTED BY MAILING A COPY THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
MAIL (OR ANY SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR FORM OF MAIL), POSTAGE PREPAID, TO BORROWER
AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR AT SUCH OTHER ADDRESS OF
WHICH THE COLLATERAL AGENT SHALL HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED PURSUANT THERETO. IF ANY
AGENT APPOINTED BY ANY PLEDGOR REFUSES TO ACCEPT SERVICE, SUCH PLEDGOR HEREBY
AGREES THAT SERVICE UPON IT BY MAIL SHALL CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT NOTICE. NOTHING
HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT TO BRING PROCEEDINGS
AGAINST ANY PLEDGOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE PLEDGORS HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         SECTION 12.11 Severability of Provisions. Any provision hereof which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 12.12 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and any
amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original,
but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 12.13 Limitation on Interest Payable. It is the intention of
the parties to conform strictly to the usury laws, whether state or Federal,
that are applicable to the transaction of which this Agreement is a part. All
agreements between the Pledgors and the Collateral Agent whether now existing or
hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly limited so
that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or agreed to be
paid by the Pledgors for the use, forbearance or detention of the money to be
loaned under the Credit Agreement, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, the
Hedging Agreements, the Cash Management Agreements or any other Loan Document,
or for the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein
or in the Credit Agreement, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, the Hedging
Agreements, the Cash Management Agreements or any other Loan Document, exceed
the maximum amount permissible under applicable Federal or state usury laws. If
under any circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any such provision, at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the
limit of validity prescribed by law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall
be reduced to the limit of such validity. If under any circumstances the
Pledgors shall have paid an amount deemed interest by applicable law, which
would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount that would be excessive
interest under applicable usury laws shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing in respect of the Secured Obligations and not to the
payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of
principal and any other amounts due hereunder, the excess shall be refunded to
the Pledgors. All sums paid or agreed to be paid for the use, forbearance or
detention of the principal under any extension of credit by the Collateral Agent
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and to the extent necessary to
preclude exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread from the date hereof until payment in full of the
Secured Obligations so that the actual rate of interest on account of such
principal amounts is uniform throughout the term hereof.

         SECTION 12.14 Business Days. In the event any time period or any date
provided in this Agreement ends or falls on a day other than a Business Day,
then such time period shall be deemed to end and such date shall be deemed to
fall on the next succeeding Business Day, and performance herein may be made on
such Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such other day.

         SECTION 12.15 Relationship. The relationship of Collateral Agent to
each of the Pledgors hereunder is strictly and solely that of lender to borrower
and secured party to pledgor, and nothing contained in the Credit Agreement,
this Agreement, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, the Hedging Agreements,
the Cash Management Agreements or any other document or instrument now existing
and delivered in connection therewith or otherwise in connection with the
Secured Obligations is intended to create, or shall in any event or under any
circumstance be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture,
tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy or other relationship of any nature whatsoever
between Collateral Agent and each of the Pledgors other than as lender and
borrower and mortgagee and mortgagor.

         SECTION 12.16 Waiver of Stay. Each Pledgor agrees that in the event
that such Pledgor or any property or assets of such Pledgor shall hereafter
become the subject of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code or such Pledgor shall otherwise be a party to any Federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding to which the provisions
relating to the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any
similar provision in any such law is applicable, then, in any such case, whether
or not the Collateral Agent has commenced foreclosure proceedings under this
Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to relief from any such
automatic stay as it relates to the exercise of any of the rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, any foreclosure proceedings) available to the
Collateral Agent as provided in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 12.17 No Credit for Payment of Taxes or Imposition. Such
Pledgor shall not be entitled to any credit against the principal, premium, if
any, or interest payable under the Credit Agreement, and such Pledgor shall not
be entitled to any credit against any other sums which may become payable under
the terms thereof or hereof, by reason of the payment of any Tax on the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof

         SECTION 12.18 No Claims Against Collateral Agent. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall constitute any consent or request by the Collateral Agent,
express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof, nor as giving any Pledgor any right, power or
authority to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or
the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would
permit the making of any claim against the Collateral Agent in respect thereof
or any claim that any Lien based on the performance of such labor or services or

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

         Section 1. Post Office Box. The Bank will rent P.O. Box [     ] (the
"Bank Lockbox") of the post office located at [ ] in the name of Pledgor. All
account debtors on the Accounts of Pledgor have been, or will be, instructed
to mail their remittances to the Bank Lockbox.

         Section 2. Access to Mail. The Bank will have exclusive and
unrestricted access to the Bank Lockbox and will have complete and exclusive
authority to receive, pick up and open all regular, registered, certified or
insured mail addressed to the Bank Lockbox. On written demand of Collateral
Agent, the Bank shall cease its processing of such mail, and shall release the
same, in kind, to Collateral Agent, without the prior consent of Pledgor, and
Collateral Agent shall thereafter process said mail promptly in accordance with
this agreement. The Bank shall not inquire into Collateral Agent's right to make
such a demand under any agreement among Collateral Agent, Lenders and Pledgor,
and shall be forever released of all obligations with respect to said
remittances upon release to Collateral Agent. Pledgor shall have no control
whatsoever over any mail, checks, money orders, collections or other forms of
remittances received in any Lockbox. Appropriate instructions have been, or will
be, given by the Bank to the United States Post Office where the Bank Lockbox is
maintained, and such instructions shall not be revoked without the prior written
consent of Collateral Agent. Except as permitted under Section 3 below, any
instruction given to the Bank by Pledgor without the prior written agreement of
Collateral Agent shall be void and of no force or effect. All mail addressed to
the Bank Lockbox will be picked up by the Bank according to its regular
collection schedule.

         Section 3. Remittance Collection. On the day received, the Bank will
open all mail addressed to the Bank Lockbox and remove and inspect the

     receipt shall be processed on the date indicated on the check. The Bank
     shall not deposit checks postdated more than three days, but shall notify
     Collateral Agent by telephone of such checks and follow Collateral Agent's
     instructions for disposition of such checks.
<PAGE>
         (iii)    Stale Date. Checks dated six months or more prior to the date
     of collection will not be deposited and shall be sent to Collateral Agent.

         (iv)     Different Amount. Where written and numeric amounts differ,
     a check will be processed by the Bank only if the correct amount can be
     determined from the accompanying documents, otherwise the check will not be
     deposited and shall be sent to Collateral Agent.

         (v)      Signature Missing. Checks which do not bear the drawer's
     signature and do not indicate the drawer's identity will not be deposited
     but shall be sent to Collateral Agent. If, as determined by the Bank, the
     drawer can be identified from the face of the check, the Bank will deposit
     and process the check by affixing a stamped impression requesting the
     drawer bank to contact the drawer for authority to pay.

         (vi)     Alterations and Restrictions. Checks with alterations and
     checks bearing restrictive notations such as "Payment in Full" will not be
     deposited, and the Bank shall notify Collateral Agent of such checks by
     telephone on the day of receipt and will deposit, hold or forward such
     checks with accompanying written matter, if any, as requested by Collateral
     Agent.

         (vii)    Foreign Banks and Currency. Checks drawn in foreign currency
     will be processed in accordance with the Bank's normal procedure for such
     checks and Collateral Agent will be notified by telephone of any such
     checks on the date received by the Bank.

         (viii)   Instruments or Other Payments. Instruments evidencing, or
     other forms of payment in respect of, the Accounts, will be processed in
     accordance with the Bank's normal procedure, and the Bank shall notify
     Collateral Agent of such Instruments or other forms of payment by telephone
     on the day of receipt and will hold or forward such Instruments or other
     forms of payment with accompanying written matter, if any, as requested by
     Collateral Agent.

To the extent requested by Collateral Agent, Pledgor shall assist and instruct
Collateral Agent in connection with the orderly and expeditious processing of
the checks described in clauses (i)-(vii). Any items which Collateral Agent has
specifically instructed the Bank in writing not to process will not be deposited
and shall be sent to Collateral Agent.

acceptable for deposit under the terms hereof, shall be deposited on the day of
receipt by the Bank to Account No. [______] at the Bank (the "Collection

remittance, except as provided in Section 5 hereof

         Section 10. Bank Liability. In acting under this Agreement, the Bank

<PAGE>
                                                                       EXHIBIT H

                                     FORM OF
                               GUARANTEE AGREEMENT

            GUARANTEE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of [ ], among SOLA
INTERNATIONAL INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), [INSERT NAME OF
GUARANTOR], (the "Guarantor") and UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA, N.A., as collateral
agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent") for the Secured Parties (as
defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below).

            Reference is made to that certain Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of October 28, 2002 (as amended, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement")
among the Borrower, the Lenders (as defined in Article I thereof), UNION BANK OF
CALIFORNIA, N.A., as Sole Lead Arranger, as an Issuing Bank, as Administrative
Agent, and as Collateral Agent for the Lenders. Capitalized terms used and not
defined herein (including, without limitation, the term "Obligations," as used
in Section 1 and elsewhere herein) are used with the meanings assigned to such
terms in the Credit Agreement.

            The Lenders have agreed to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower, and
the Issuing Bank has agreed to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the
Borrower, in each case pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor is a Subsidiary of
the Borrower and acknowledges that it has derived and will derive substantial
benefit from the making of the Revolving Loans by the Lenders to the Borrower
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit by the Issuing Bank for the account of
the Borrower. As consideration therefor and in order to induce the Lenders to
make Revolving Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit, the
Guarantor is willing to execute this Agreement.

            Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

            SECTION 1. Guarantee. The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees,
jointly with any other guarantors of the Obligations under the Credit Agreement
and other Loan Documents (the "Other Guarantors") and severally, as a primary
obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment of the
Obligations. The Guarantor waives notice of and hereby consents to any
agreements or arrangements whatsoever by the Secured Parties with any other
person pertaining to the Obligations, including agreements and arrangements for
payment, extension, renewal, subordination, composition, arrangement, discharge
or release of the whole or any part of the Obligations, or for the discharge or
surrender of any or all security, or for the compromise, whether by way of
acceptance of part payment or otherwise, and the same shall in no way impair the
Guarantor's liability hereunder.

            SECTION 2. Obligations Not Waived. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from
and protest to the Borrower or any other person of any of the Obligations, and
also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee, notice of protest for
nonpayment and all other formalities. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected
by
<PAGE>
(a) the failure of any Loan Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or
exercise any right or remedy against the Borrower or any Other Guarantor under
the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise;
(b) any extension, renewal or increase of or in any of the Obligations; (c) any
rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from, any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any other Loan
Document, any guarantee or any other agreement or instrument, including with
respect to any Other Guarantor under the Loan Documents; (d) the release of (or
the failure to perfect a security interest in) any of the security held by or on
behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party; or (e) the failure or
delay of any Secured Party to exercise any right or remedy against the Borrower
or any Other Guarantor of the Obligations.

            SECTION 3. Security. The Guarantor authorizes the Collateral Agent
to (a) take and hold security for the payment of this Guarantee and the
Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; (b)
apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as it in its
sole discretion may determine subject to the terms of any other Loan Documents;
and (c) release or substitute any one or more endorsees, other guarantors or
other obligors. In no event shall this Section 3 require any Guarantor to grant
security, except as required by the terms of the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 4. Guarantee of Payment. The Guarantor further agrees that
its guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection,
and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Collateral Agent
or any other Secured Party to any of the security held for payment of the
Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of
the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the Borrower or any
other person.

            SECTION 5. No Discharge or Diminishment of Guarantee. The
obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of
waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations,
and shall not be subject to any defense (other than a defense of payment) or
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by
the failure of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other
Loan Document, any guarantee or any other agreement or instrument, by any
amendment, waiver or modification of any provision of the Credit Agreement or
any other Loan Document or other agreement or instrument, by any default,
failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations,
or by any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in
any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or that would
otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity
(other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations) or
which would impair or eliminate any right of the Guarantor to subrogation.

            SECTION 6. Defenses Waived. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of the
unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause or the
cessation from any cause of the liability (other than the

                                       2
<PAGE>
final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations) of the
Borrower or any other person. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties
may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by
one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such
security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the
Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrower or any other
guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the
Borrower or any other guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have
been fully, finally and indefeasibly paid in cash. Pursuant to applicable law,
the Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though
such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish
any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the
Guarantor against the Borrower or any other guarantor or any security.

            SECTION 7. Agreement to Pay; Subordination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Collateral Agent or
any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against the Guarantor by virtue
hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any
Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Guarantor hereby
promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Collateral Agent
or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash an amount equal to the
unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and
unpaid interest and fees on such Obligations. Upon payment by the Guarantor of
any sums to the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party as provided above, all
rights of the Guarantor against the Borrower arising as a result thereof by way
of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise
shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any
indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary now or hereafter held by the
Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in
full of the Obligations. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account
of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right
or (ii) any such indebtedness at any time when any Obligation then due and owing
has not been paid, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Collateral Agent to be
credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured,
in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 8. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any
action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or
foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement
would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account
of the amount of its liability under this Agreement, then, notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any
further action by the Guarantor, any creditor or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined
in such action or proceeding.

            SECTION 9. Information. The Guarantor assumes all responsibility for
being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and
assets, all other circumstances

                                       3
<PAGE>
bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and
extent of the risks that the Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder and agrees
that none of the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any
duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding
such circumstances or risks.

            SECTION 10. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor represents
and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it
contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct.

            SECTION 11. Termination. The Guarantees made hereunder (a) shall
terminate when (i) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest (including
interest accruing during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or
allowable in such proceeding) on all Revolving Loans; (ii) each payment required
to be made under the Credit Agreement in respect of any Letter of Credit; and
(iii) all other Obligations then due and owing, have in each case been
indefeasibly paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend
under the Credit Agreement, the L/C Exposure has been reduced to zero and the
Issuing Bank has no further obligation to issue Letters of Credit under the
Credit Agreement and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment, or any part thereof, on any Obligation
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Secured Party upon the
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, the Guarantor or otherwise.

            SECTION 12. Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments;
Releases. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to,
such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such
party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the
Guarantor that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the
benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This
Agreement shall become effective as to the Guarantor when a counterpart hereof
executed on behalf of the Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Collateral
Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the
Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon the Guarantor and the
Collateral Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to
the benefit of the Guarantor, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured
Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the
Borrower nor the Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or
obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment
shall be void) without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders. The
Collateral Agent is hereby expressly authorized to, and agrees upon request of
the Borrower that it will, release the Guarantor from its obligations hereunder
in the event that all the capital stock of the Guarantor shall be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of to a person that is not an Affiliate of the
Borrower in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05 of the Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 13. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the
Collateral Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder
and of the other Secured Parties under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of this

                                       4
<PAGE>
Agreement or consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Guarantor in any
case shall entitle the Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between
the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Collateral Agent (with the consent of the
Lenders if required under the Credit Agreement).

            SECTION 14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

            SECTION 15. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall
be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. All
communications and notices hereunder to the Guarantor shall be given to it at
its address set forth in Schedule 1 hereof with a copy to the Borrower.

            SECTION 16. Survival of Agreement; Severability.

            (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
by the Borrower and the Guarantor herein and in the certificates or other
instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied
upon by the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the
making by the Lenders of the Revolving Loans and the issuance of the Letters of
Credit by the Issuing Bank regardless of any investigation made by the Secured
Parties or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long
as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any other fee or
amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding
and unpaid, the L/C Exposure does not equal zero or the Commitments and the L/C
Commitment have not been terminated.

            (b) In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself
affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

            SECTION 17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as
provided in Section 12 hereof. Delivery of an executed signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

            SECTION 18. Rules of Interpretation. The rules of interpretation
specified in Section 1.02 of the Credit Agreement shall be applicable to this
Agreement.

            SECTION 19. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

            (a) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any California
State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the City
of San Francisco, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding maybe heard and determined in such
California State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Collateral Agent or
any other Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against the Guarantor or
its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents in any California State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

            (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 15 hereof. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

            SECTION 20. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 20.

            SECTION 21. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Secured Party is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time

                                       6
<PAGE>
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Indebtedness at any
time owing by such Secured Party to or for the credit or the account of the
Guarantor against any or all the obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents held by such Secured
Party, irrespective of whether or not the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Secured Party
under this Section 21 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) which such Secured Party may have.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

                                October 29, 2002

Union Bank of California, N.A., as
  Sole Lead Arranger, Administrative
  Agent and Collateral Agent
The Lenders (each as defined in the
  Credit Agreement referred to
  below)

     Re:     Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 28, 2002
             (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Sola International Inc. (the
             "Borrower"), the Lenders signatory thereto (the "Lenders"), Union
             Bank of California, N.A., as sole lead arranger, administrative
             agent and collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as counsel to the Borrower in connection with the negotiation
and documentation of the Credit Agreement. This opinion is being delivered
pursuant to Section 4.02(c) of the Credit Agreement. All capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Credit
Agreement. All other capitalized terms used without definition in this opinion
have the meanings given to them in the Uniform Commercial Code (the "Code") as
adopted and in effect in the State of Incorporation.

     In connection with the delivery of this opinion, we have examined
originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of
the documents set forth below. Except as otherwise noted, all of the following
documents are dated as of October 28, 2002:

     (i)     the Credit Agreement;

     (ii)    the Revolving Notes of the Borrower payable to the order of each
             Lender in the original amount of its Commitment (the "Notes");

     (iii)   the Amended and Restated Security Agreement by Borrower in favor of
             the Collateral Agent (the "Security Agreement");

     (iv)    UCC-1 Financing Statement listed on Schedule A hereto describing
             certain personal property of the Borrower and naming Borrower as
             debtor and the Collateral Agent as secured party (the "Financing
             Statement");
<PAGE>
     (v)     the Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower certified by the
             Secretary of State of Delaware (the "State of Incorporation") as of
             October 23, 2002 and certified to us by an officer of the Borrower
             as being complete and in full force and effect as of the date of
             this opinion (the "Certificate of Incorporation");

     (vi)    the By-laws of the Borrower certified to us by an officer of the
             Borrower as being complete and in full force and effect as of the
             date of this opinion (the "By-laws");

     (vii)   a certificate of Good Standing relating to the Borrower issued by
             the Delaware Secretary of State; and

     (viii)  foreign corporation good standing or similar certificates related
             to the Borrower issued by each of the States of Florida, Missouri,
             Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and West
             Virginia.

     The documents referenced in items (i) through (iii) above are collectively
referred to herein as the "Loan Documents". The documents referenced in items
(iii) and (iv) above are collectively referred to herein as the "Security
Documents".

     Our opinion as expressed in Opinion 1 as to the good standing of the
Borrower under the laws of the states specified is based solely upon
certificates of good standing from each of such jurisdictions and we have made
no additional investigation with respect to the status of the Borrower in such
jurisdictions either before or after the respective dates of such certificates.

     We have also examined originals, executed counterparts or copies of such
other agreements, company records, instruments and certificates, certificates of
public authorities and such matters of law as we have deemed necessary for the
purpose of rendering this opinion. To the extent we deemed necessary for
purposes of this opinion, we have relied upon (i) the statements and
representations of officers of the Borrower as to factual matters, (ii) the
corporate records provided to us by such officers, and (iii) certificates and
other documents obtained from public officials. We have further relied as to
factual matters on the representations and warranties contained in the Loan
Documents and we have assumed the completeness and accuracy of all such
representations and warranties as to factual matters. We express no opinion
herein as to the enforceability of the choice of law provisions of the Loan
Documents. As to matters of enforceability, it is our understanding that you are
relying on the opinion of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman Machtinger & Kinsella
LLP dated of even date herewith. To the extent that laws of the State of
California are applicable, this opinion is subject to the same exceptions,
assumptions, qualifications and other limitations as set forth in the opinion of
Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman Machtinger & Kinsella LLP.

     We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of
all individuals who have executed the Loan Documents and all other documents we
have reviewed, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals
and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as
certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies. We have also assumed
that the Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
each of the parties thereto (other than the Borrower as to due authorization)
and

                                       2
<PAGE>
are enforceable in accordance with their terms against the parties thereto and
that the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by each of the parties
thereto (other than the Borrower) and the performance of their respective
obligations thereunder do not and will not result in a breach of, or constitute
a default under, any agreement, instrument or other document to which such party
is a party or any order, judgment, writ or decree applicable to such party or to
which such party's property is subject.

     We confirm that we do not have knowledge of any fact or circumstance that
has caused us to conclude that our reliance and assumptions cited in the two
immediately preceding paragraphs are unwarranted.

     Whenever our opinion with respect to factual matters is indicated to be
based on our knowledge, we are referring to the actual knowledge of George C.
McKann, Nancy McDonald Borders, Edward J. Tabaczyk, Matthew R. Andris and
Charles J. Kolin, who are all of the Gardner, Carton & Douglas attorneys who
have represented the Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Credit Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not
undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence
of such facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence
of such facts should be drawn from such representation.

     We have also assumed the following:

     A.  The Lenders have given value pursuant to the Loan Documents.

     B.  The Borrower has, or has the power to transfer, rights in the personal
         property collateral described in the Security Documents.

     C.  The descriptions of collateral contained in, or attached as schedules
         to, the Security Documents (other than the Financing Statement)
         sufficiently describe the collateral intended to be covered by the
         Security Documents.

     D.  The Financing Statement will be duly filed in the office of the
         Secretary of State of the State of Incorporation in accordance with
         the provisions of the Code of the State of Incorporation.

     E.  The Pledged Securities (as defined in the Security Agreement) are
         certificated securities located in the State of Incorporation.

     We express no opinion as to the priority of any security interest created,
or purported to be created by any of the Security Documents.

     Based upon and subject to our examination as aforesaid and subject to the
assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the
opinion that:

     1.  The Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and

                                       3
<PAGE>
authority to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and
to perform its obligations under such Loan Documents and to own or lease its
property and to carry on its business now conducted. The Borrower is qualified
to do business in and is in good standing in each of the following states:
Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia
and West Virginia.

     2.  Each of the Loan Documents has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action by the Borrower.

     3.  The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower and
the performance of its obligations thereunder (i) are not in contravention of
any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Borrower,
(ii) will not result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in
the creation of any lien upon or with respect to any property of the Borrower
(other than any Lien created under the Security Documents) pursuant to the
provisions of, (A) any agreement listed on Schedule 3.10(a) of the Credit
Agreement or (B) any order, writ, judgment or decree known to us, based solely
on discussions with the Borrower, to which the Borrower or its property is
subject, and (iii) do not violate any provision of any applicable federal or
Illinois state statute, rule or regulation which is normally applicable to
transactions of the type contemplated by the Loan Documents. We express no
opinion as to whether the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the
Borrower and the performance of its obligations thereunder will constitute a
breach of, or constitute a default under, any covenant or provision with respect
to financial ratios or tests or any aspect of the financial condition or results
of operations of the Borrower contained in an agreement to which the Borrower is
a party. We would also note that certain of the agreements listed on Schedule
3.10(a) of the Credit Agreement are governed by laws other than the laws of the
State of Illinois, and we have assumed, with your permission, that such
agreements are governed by the laws of the State of Illinois for purposes of
rendering our opinion as set forth in clause (A) above.

     4.  Except for such filings, authorizations or approvals as are
specifically contemplated by the Loan Documents, no authorizations or approvals
of, and no filings with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of
the United States or the State of Illinois, are necessary for the execution or
delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower or the performance of its
obligations thereunder.

     5.  A security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent has attached under
the Code in the Pledged Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement)
described in the Security Documents consisting of personal property to which a
security interest may attach under Article 9 of the Code. Subject to the
appropriate filing of continuation statements relating to the Financing
Statement in accordance with the Code, the Security Agreement is in proper form
under the Code to create a valid security interest in favor of the Collateral
Agent in after acquired Pledged Collateral covered by Article 9 of the Code to
secure Revolving Loans made after the date hereof.

     6.  The Financing Statement is in proper form for filing in the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Incorporation and, upon due filing in
such office, the security interest

                                       4
<PAGE>
created by the Security Documents in the Pledged Collateral described in the
Financing Statement will be perfected to the extent a security interest can be
perfected in such Pledged Collateral under the Code by the filing of a financing
statement in that office.

     7.  The security interest in the certificated securities described in the
Security Agreement (the "Pledged Shares") will be a perfected security interest
in the Pledged Shares upon (i) the execution and delivery of the Security
Agreement by all parties to that agreement, (ii) the Collateral Agent taking
possession of the Pledged Shares, and (iii) the Collateral Agent executing and
delivering an acknowledgment to such effect. In reliance on the representations
of the Collateral Agent in the Security Agreement as to the absence of any other
agreements covering the Pledged Shares to which the Collateral Agent is a party,
and assuming the Pledged Shares have been endorsed in blank, in each case by an
effective endorsement, the Collateral Agent has a security interest in the
Pledged Shares.

     8.  To our knowledge, based solely upon discussion with the Borrower, there
is no pending or overtly threatened action or proceeding before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator against or directly involving the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries which, in any case, (i) may materially and adversely affect the
financial condition or operation of the Borrower, (ii) seeks to restrain or
would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated
by the Loan Documents or (iii) would affect the validity or enforceability of
all or any of the Loan Documents.

     9.  No registration under the Securities Act is required for the execution
or delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or the performance of its
obligations thereunder.

     10. Before and after giving effect to the Transactions, the Borrower is not
required to be registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     Our opinions are further qualified as follows:

     (a) Except as set forth in Opinions 5, 6 and 7 above, we express no opinion
as to the creation or perfection of any lien, mortgage or security interest
granted pursuant to the Loan Documents and we express no opinion as to the
priority of any lien, mortgage or security interest granted pursuant to the Loan
Documents. We have further assumed that the name of the secured party shown on
the Financing Statement is correct and the address of the secured party on such
financing statements is an address from which information concerning the
security interest can be obtained. Perfection of a security interest in proceeds
of any collateral may be limited as provided in Section 9-315 of the Code. A
security interest in collateral acquired after the respective dates of the
applicable Security Documents may not attach to such collateral under Bankruptcy
Code Section 552.

     (b) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) self-help
provisions, (ii) provisions which purport to establish evidentiary standards,
(iii) provisions relating to waiver of remedies, waiver of right of
reinstatement, disclaimers, liability limitations, releases of legal or
equitable rights, discharge of defenses or waivers of breach of the peace, or
(iv) contribution

                                       5
<PAGE>
or indemnification provisions, the enforcement of which may be limited by public
policy considerations.

     (c) We express no opinion herein as to the validity or enforceability of
any provision of the Loan Documents which (i) purports to waive trial by jury,
(ii) provides that waivers, consents, amendments or modifications must be in
writing, (iii) purports to confer, waive or consent to the jurisdiction of any
court, (iv) specifies the law intended to govern the Loan Documents, or (v)
provides for reimbursement for attorneys' fees to the extent such attorneys'
fees are not reasonable.

     (d) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision
purporting to preserve and maintain the liability of any party despite the fact
that the guaranteed debt is unenforceable.

     (e) We express no opinion as to any provision of the Loan Documents
relating to severability, as applied to any portion thereof deemed by a court to
be material.

     (f) Except as provided in Opinions 9 and 10 above, we express no opinion
regarding the applicability or effect of or any compliance with any federal or
state antitrust laws, securities laws, environmental laws, ERISA laws, banking
laws, zoning laws, health laws, safety laws, building laws, land use laws,
subdivision laws and the rules and regulations pertaining thereto.

     (g) We express no opinion herein as to the validity or enforceability of
any provision of any of the Loan Documents regarding penalties, liquidated
damages, forfeiture or interest on past due interest.

     The continued perfection of the security interests created by the Security
Agreement and perfected by the filing of the Financing Statement will depend
upon the filing of periodic continuation statements relating to the Financing
Statement in accordance with the Code and may depend upon (i) the continued
incorporation of the Borrower in the State of Incorporation; and (ii) the
continuation of the Borrower's present corporate name.

     The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws and regulations of the
United States, the State of Illinois, the Delaware General Corporation Law, and
the Code of the State of Incorporation (as to the perfection requirements of the
Code of such state) and we have not considered and express no opinion on the
laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction. This opinion is rendered only
with respect to the laws and the regulations thereunder which are in effect as
of the date hereof. Please be advised that no member of this firm is admitted to
practice in the State of Incorporation. In rendering the opinions set forth in
Opinions 5, 6 and 7 of this opinion, insofar as such opinions involve
conclusions under the law of the State of Incorporation, such opinions are based
solely upon our review of Article 9 of the Code as in effect in such state as it
appears in the Secured Transactions Guide published by Commerce Clearing House,
Inc., as updated through July 31, 2002, and we have not reviewed any cases
interpreting such Code. We assume no responsibility for updating this opinion to
take into account any event, action, interpretation or change of law occurring
subsequent to the date hereof that may affect the validity of any of the
opinions expressed herein.

     This opinion is furnished by us solely for your benefit for use in

it may not be furnished or quoted to, or relied upon by, any other person,

your federal, state or local regulators having jurisdiction over you and

      OPINION OF GREENBERG GLUSKER FIELDS CLAMAN MACHTINGER & KINESLLA LLP

                           October 29, 2002

Union Bank of California, N.A.
As Sole Lead Arranger, an Issuing Bank,
Administrative (each as defined in the Credit
Agreement referred to below)

         Re:    Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 28,
                2002 (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Sola International
                Inc. (the "Borrower"), the Lenders signatory thereto (the
                "Lenders"), and Union Bank of California, N.A., as sole leader
                arranger, as an Issuing Bank, as Administrative Agent as
                Collateral Agent ("UBOC")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special California counsel to the Borrower in connection
with the Credit Agreement. This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section
4.02 (c) of the Credit Agreement. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement.

     In rendering the opinion set forth below we have examined the Credit
Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Revolving Notes. We have also made
such examination of the law as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of this
opinion.

     The term "Transaction Documents" is used in this opinion to refer
collectively to the Credit Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Revolving
Notes.

                                       7
<PAGE>
     We have assumed that (i) each of the Transaction Documents has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each of the parties thereto; (ii) each
such party is validly organized and subsisting and in good standing in all
relevant jurisdictions and has all requisite power and authority, and has taken
all necessary action, to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and to effect the transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) the Transaction
Documents are binding upon and enforceable against the Lenders and UBOC; and
(iv) all documents submitted to us as copies conform with the original
documents.

     Based upon our examination and assumptions described above, relying on
statements of facts contained in the documents we have examined and subject to
the qualifications and limitations set forth in this opinion below, it is our
opinion that:

     1.  Each of the Transaction Documents constitutes a legal, valid and
         binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in
         accordance with its terms.

     2.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Transaction
         Documents, the borrowings by the Borrower in accordance with the terms
         of the Credit Agreement, the application of the proceeds thereof as
         provided in the Credit Agreement, the performance of the Borrower's
         payment and other obligations under the Transaction Documents and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
         Documents will not violate or result in a breach or default under the
         laws of the State of California.

     3.  A federal or state court sitting in California will honor the
         parties' choice of internal laws of the State of California as the law
         applicable to the Transaction Documents.

     4.  Except for such filings and recordings which are necessary to
         perfect the security interests granted under the Transaction Documents
         and such other filings, authorizations or approvals as are specifically
         contemplated by the Transaction Documents, no authorizations or
         approvals of, and no filings with any governmental or regulatory agency
         of the State of California are necessary for the execution, delivery or
         performance of the Transaction Documents by the Borrower.

     The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following limitations,
qualifications and exceptions:

     A.  The enforceability of the Transaction Documents against the Borrower
         may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         moratorium, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws
         affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
         and (ii) equitable principals, including, without limitation, concepts
         of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the
         possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
         other equitable remedies, regardless of whether enforcement is sought
         in a proceeding in equity or at law.

     B.  We express no opinion as to the legality, validity, binding effect
         or enforceability of (i) indemnification provisions in the Transaction
         Documents to the extent the same may be limited by applicable laws or
         public policy; (ii) provisions in the Transaction Documents that relate
         to the consent of the Borrower to venue in any legal action arising
         under the Transaction Documents in any state or federal court in
         California; (iii) provisions to the effect that failure to exercise or
         delay in exercising rights or remedies

                                       8
<PAGE>
         will not operate as a waiver of any such rights or remedies, or
         provisions which state that waivers or modification must be in writing;
         (iv) provisions waiving broadly or vaguely stated rights, unknown
         future rights or rights which may not be waived on statutory or public
         policy grounds, or provisions stating the rights or remedies are not
         exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be
         exercised in addition to or with any other right or remedy, or that the
         election of a right or remedy does not preclude recourse to one or more
         others: (v) provisions which purport to create a conclusive presumption
         or permit a conclusive determination; and (vi) the Transaction
         Documents, with respect to any state securities laws.

     C.  We express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions that
         purport to give the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent the
         right to apply and dispose of any insurance or condemnation proceeds
         (including, without limitation, the right to apply all of such proceeds
         to reduce the Commitments or to repay the Secured Obligations), in view
         of the California real estate cases which require the security to have
         been impaired and the lender to deal in good faith with the borrower
         with respect to the application and disposition of such proceeds.

     D.  We do not believe that the provision authorizing the Collateral
         Agent or any other Secured Party to purchase any or all of the Pledged
         Collateral at a private sale would be enforceable by reason of Section
         9610 (c)(2) of the UCC unless it can be demonstrated that the Pledged
         Collateral to be purchased "is of a kind that is customarily sold in a
         recognized market or the widely distributed standard price quotations".
         We are unaware whether such standard can be met.

         We are licensed to practice law only in the State of California.
         Accordingly, the foregoing opinions apply only insofar as the laws of
         the State of California may be concerned and we do not express any
         opinion as to matters governed by any federal laws or the laws of any
         other state.

         This opinion addresses only the matters requested by you and you must
         judge whether the matters addressed herein are sufficient for your
         purposes. We do not express any opinion as to any other matter.

         This opinion speaks only as of its date and is limited to present
         statutes, regulations, judicial interpretations, orders, directives and
         decrees applicable to the facts as they presently exist. In rendering
         this opinion, we assume no obligation to revise or supplement this
         opinion should the present laws be changed by legislative or regulatory
         action, judicial decision or otherwise.

         This opinion may be relied upon only by you and your successors and
         assigns, and only in connection with the transactions described herein,
         and may not be used or relied upon by you or any other person for any
         other purpose whatsoever, without in each instance our prior written
         consent.

                                Very truly yours,
