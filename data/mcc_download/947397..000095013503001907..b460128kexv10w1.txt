                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS

                  Each of the Purchasers hereby represents and warrants,
severally and not jointly, to the Company as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date as follows:

                  4.1      Existence and Power. Such Purchaser (a) is a limited
partnership, corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation and (b) has the requisite partnership, corporate or limited liability
company, as the case may be, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party.

                  4.2      Authorization; No Contravention. The execution,
delivery and performance by such Purchaser of this Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (a) have been duly authorized by all necessary
partnership, corporate or limited liability company, as the case may be, action,
(b) do not contravene the terms of such Purchaser's organizational documents, or
any amendment thereof, (c) do not violate, conflict with or result in any breach
or contravention of, or the creation of any Lien under, any Contractual
Obligation of such Purchaser or any Requirement of Law applicable to such
Purchaser, and (d) do not violate any Orders of any Governmental Authority
against, or binding upon, such Purchaser.

                  4.3      Governmental Authorization; Third Party Consents. No
approval, consent, compliance, exemption, authorization or other action by, or
notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, and

required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance (including,
without limitation, the purchase of the Purchased Shares or, in the case of
Beacon, the Beacon Warrant) by, or enforcement against, such Purchaser of this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

                  4.4      Binding Effect. This Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been duly executed and
delivered by such Purchaser and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles relating to enforceability (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

                  4.5      Purchase for Own Account. The Purchased Shares and,
in the case of Beacon, the Beacon Warrant to be acquired by such Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement are being or will be acquired for its own account and
with no intention of distributing or reselling such Purchased Shares or, in the
case of Beacon, the Beacon Warrant or any part thereof in any transaction that
would be in violation of the securities laws of the United States of America,
any state of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction, without prejudice,
however, to the rights of such Purchaser at all times to sell or otherwise
dispose of all or any part of such Purchased Shares or, in the case of Beacon,
the Beacon Warrant under an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, or under an exemption from such registration available under the
Securities Act, and subject, nevertheless, to the disposition of such
Purchaser's property being at all times within its control. If such Purchaser
should in the future decide to dispose of any of such Purchased Shares or, in
the case of Beacon, the Beacon Warrant, such Purchaser understands and agrees
that it may do so only in compliance with the Securities Act and applicable
state and foreign securities laws, as then in effect. Such Purchaser agrees to
the imprinting, so long as required by law, of a legend on certificates
representing all of its Purchased Shares or, in the case of Beacon, the Beacon
Warrant and shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of its Purchased
Shares or, in the case of Beacon, exercise of the Beacon Warrant to the
following effect:

                  THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY FOREIGN JURISDICTION.
THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN
SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT AND SUCH LAWS.

                  4.6      Restricted Securities. Such Purchaser understands
that the Purchased Shares and, in the case of Beacon, the Beacon Warrant will
not be registered at the time of their issuance under the Securities Act for the
reason that the sale provided for in this Agreement is exempt pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and that the reliance of the Company on such
exemption is predicated in part on such Purchaser's representations set forth
herein.

                  4.7      Accredited Investor. Such Purchaser is an "Accredited
Investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities
Act, as presently in effect.

such Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based on

taken by such Purchaser.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATION
                             OF THE COMPANY TO CLOSE

                  The obligation of the Company to issue and sell the Purchased
Shares and the Beacon Warrant and the obligation of the Company to perform its
other obligations hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction as determined
by, or waiver by, the Company of the following conditions on or before the
Closing Date:

                  6.1      Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of each Purchaser contained in Article IV hereof shall be true
and correct in all material respects (except for any such representations and
warranties which are qualified by their terms by a reference to materiality or
material adverse effect, which representation as so qualified shall be true and
correct in all respects) at and on the Closing Date as if made at and on such
date, except for those representations and warranties that are expressly limited
by their terms to dates or times other than the Closing Date, which
representations or warranties need only be true and correct as aforesaid as of
such other dates or times.

                  6.2      Payment of Purchase Price. Each Purchaser shall be
prepared to pay the aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Shares to be
purchased by such Purchaser and, in the case of Beacon, the aggregate purchase

                  6.3      Registration Rights Agreement. Each Purchaser shall
have duly executed and delivered the Registration Rights Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

                  7.1      Indemnification. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article VII, the Company (the "Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless

<PAGE>

                                                                              29

each of the Purchasers and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, partners, members and controlling
persons (each, an "Indemnified Party") to the fullest extent permitted by law
from and against any and all losses, Claims, or written threats thereof
(including, without limitation, any Claim by a third party), damages, expenses
(including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred
by the Indemnified Party in any action between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party or between the Indemnified Party and any third party or
otherwise) or other liabilities (collectively, "Losses") resulting from or
arising out of any breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement by the Company in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.
The amount of any payment to any Indemnified Party herewith in respect of any
Loss shall be of sufficient amount to make such Indemnified Party whole for any
diminution in value of the Purchased Shares or the Beacon Warrant to the extent
such diminution in value is attributable to such breach. In connection with the
obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify for expenses as set forth
above, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon presentation of appropriate invoices
containing reasonable detail, reimburse each Indemnified Party for all such
expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel
incurred by the Indemnified Party in any action between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party or between the Indemnified Party and any third party)
as they are incurred by such Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if an
Indemnified Party is reimbursed under this Article VII for any expenses, such
reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded to the extent it is finally
judicially determined that the Losses in question resulted primarily from the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Party.

                  7.2      Notification. Each Indemnified Party under this
Article VII shall, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of
any Claim against such Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought from the Indemnifying Party under this Article VII, notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement thereof. The omission of any
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party of any such action shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such
Indemnified Party (a) other than pursuant to this Article VII or (b) under this
Article VII unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the
Indemnifying Party's forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses. In case any
such Claim shall be brought against any Indemnified Party, and it shall notify
the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in its reasonable judgment; provided,
however, that any Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, retain separate
counsel to participate in such defense at its own expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any Claim in which both the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand,
and an Indemnified Party, on the other hand, are, or are reasonably likely to
become, a party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to control its own defense of such Claim if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, either (x) one or more defenses
are available to the Indemnified Party that are not available to the
Indemnifying Party or (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnifying Party, on the one

<PAGE>

                                                                              30

hand, and such Indemnified Party, on the other hand, that would make such
separate representation advisable; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Party (i) shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
to all Indemnified Parties and (ii) shall reimburse the Indemnified Parties for
all of such fees and expenses of such counsel incurred in any action between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties or between the Indemnified
Parties and any third party, as such expenses are incurred. The Indemnifying
Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchasers, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened Claim relating to the matters contemplated hereby (if any
Indemnified Party is a party thereto or has been actually threatened to be made
a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liability arising or
that may arise out of such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
any settlement of any Claim effected against an Indemnified Party without its
written consent. The rights accorded to an Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at common law, by
separate agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in
this Article VII shall restrict or limit any rights that any Indemnified Party
may have to seek equitable relief.

                  7.3      Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in
this Article VII from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified
Party hereunder in respect of any Losses referred to herein, then the
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the
actions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been
made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2,
any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party
in connection with any investigation or proceeding.

reason, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any vacancy
resulting thereby to be filled by another designee of such Designated Purchaser.

                  8.7      Stand Still. Other than pursuant to this Agreement,
the conversion of the Purchased Shares or any distribution or dividend by the
Company, each of the Purchasers agrees, for itself and for its Affiliates, that
it shall not, and shall not permit any of its respective Affiliates to, and its
respective Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, or sell or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or

                            TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

                  9.1      Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior
to the Closing as follows:

                  (a)      at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by
mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchasers;

                  (b)      at the election of the Company or the Purchasers by
written notice to the other parties hereto after 5:00 p.m., New York time, on
July 15, if the Closing shall not have occurred, unless such date is extended by
the mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchasers; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not
be available (i) to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date or (ii) if the
Closing has not occurred solely because any party hereto has not yet obtained a
necessary approval from any Governmental Authority;

                  (c)      at the election of the Company, if there has been a
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of any of the Purchasers contained in this Agreement, which breach has not
been cured within fifteen (15) Business Days of notice to the Purchasers of such
breach;

                  (d)      at the election of the Purchasers, if there has been
a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company contained in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured
within fifteen (15) Business Days of notice to the Company of such breach; or

                  (e)      at the election of the Company or the Purchasers, if
the Company does not receive the Stockholder Approval described in Section 8.2.

                  If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void
and have no further force or effect, except as provided in Section 9.2.

                  9.2      Survival. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this
Agreement shall

<PAGE>

                                                                              36

become void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of
Article I, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 10.7, Section 10.11 and
Section 10.12; provided, however, that, except for the payment of the
Alternative Transaction Fee in accordance with Section 9.3 and the payment of
fees and expenses pursuant to Section 10.12, (a) none of the parties hereto
shall have any liability in respect of a termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(a), Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(e) and (b) nothing shall
relieve any of the parties from liability for actual damages resulting from a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(d); and
provided, further, that none of the parties hereto shall have any liability for
speculative, indirect, unforeseeable or consequential damages or lost profits
resulting from any legal action relating to any termination of this Agreement.

                  9.3      Alternative Transaction Fee. The Company agrees that,
from the date hereof through the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement, whichever occurs first, it will not initiate, solicit, encourage,
discuss, negotiate or accept any offers from any third party or indicate any
interest to any third party with respect to (i) the sale of capital stock of the
Company, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,
(iii) any merger or consolidation of the Company with any other person or (iv)
any material financing transaction (each, an "Alternative Transaction");
provided, however, that the Company may, if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, based upon the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, participate in discussions
regarding any such Alternative Transaction and furnish information with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement. The Company agrees to notify the Purchasers promptly if any third
party contacts the Company regarding any Alternative Transaction and to provide
to the Purchasers such information with respect thereto as the Purchasers
request. In the event that (i) (x) the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1 for any reason other than pursuant to Section 9.1(c),
including the failure to obtain the Stockholder Approval, or (y) the Purchasers
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 for any reason other than
pursuant to Section 9.1(d), including the failure to obtain the Stockholder
Approval, and (ii) the Company enters into any binding or non-binding term
sheet, letter of intent or agreement relating to an Alternative Transaction
within twelve (12) months after such termination and consummates an Alternative
Transaction within twenty-four (24) months after such termination, then the
Company shall pay an alternative transaction fee equal to $1,000,000 (the
"Alternative Transaction Fee") within two Business Days after the consummation
of such Alternative Transaction (the "Payment Date") to the Designated
Purchasers, which are the Purchasers who executed the term sheet with the
Company, dated January 14, 2003, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Such Alternative Transaction Fee shall be paid to the Designated
Purchasers pro rata with their respective commitments set forth in such term
sheet. The Company also shall be obligated to reimburse the Purchasers for their
out-of-pocket fees and expenses as provided in Section 10.11. From and after the
Payment Date, to the extent that the Alternative Transaction Fee has not been
paid, the Company shall continue to be obligated to immediately pay the
Alternative Transaction Fee and such payment will be made together with interest
at 10% compounded daily
