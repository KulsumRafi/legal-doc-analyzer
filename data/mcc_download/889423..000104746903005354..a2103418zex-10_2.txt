                            NEGATIVE PLEDGE AGREEMENT

         This Negative Pledge Agreement is made as of SEPT.13, 2002, by and
among SATCON TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, SATCON POWER SYSTEMS, INC., SATCON
ELECTRONICS, INC., SATCON APPLIED TECHNOLOGY, INC., AND SATCON POWER SYSTEMS
CANADA LTD. (individually and collectively, "Borrower") and SILICON VALLEY BANK
("Bank").

In connection with, among other documents, the Loan and Security Agreement (the
"Loan Documents") being concurrently executed herewith between Borrower and
Bank, Borrower agrees as follows:

         1.       Except for the granting of non-exclusive licenses or
                  sublicenses by Borrower in the ordinary course of business,
                  Borrower has not, and shall not, sell, transfer, assign,
                  mortgage, pledge, lease, grant a security interest in, or
                  encumber any of Borrower's Intellectual Property (as defined
                  below).

         2.       Borrower has not, and shall not, enter into a negative pledge
                  agreement, or similar agreement, affecting the rights of the
                  Intellectual Property with any other party.

         3.       Bank acknowledges that there may be circumstances where it is
                  in the mutual interest of Bank and Borrower for Borrower to
                  license exclusively one of its technologies. If, in the view
                  of Borrower, such circumstance arises, Borrower shall notify
                  Bank and advise it of the opportunity. Bank, in the exercise
                  of its reasonable commercial judgment, will promptly advise
                  Borrower of its determination with regard to such exclusive
                  licensing opportunity.

         4.       It shall be an event of default under the Loan Documents
                  between Borrower and Bank if there is a breach of any term of
                  this Negative Pledge Agreement.
