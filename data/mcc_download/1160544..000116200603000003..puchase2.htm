<P>ARTICLE 2 </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>PURCHASE PRICE; OTHER CONSIDERATION</P>

<P>2.1 Purchase Price. </P>

<P>(a) In addition to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the Purchase Price for the Purchased</P>

<P>Assets, the Accounts Receivable and all obligations of the Sellers hereunder shall be the sum of</P>

<P>$9,229,106.48 (the "Purchase Price"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the</P>

<P>Purchase Price shall be allocated pursuant to Section 2.1(b). The Purchase Price, less the Escrow</P>

<P>Amount, shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Sellers at Closing.</P>

<P>(b) Any payment of Purchase Price or any other amounts due to the Sellers under this Agreement</P>

<P>shall be paid to Sterling FBO Holdings and allocated in the following manner: 9% to Greeley</P>

<P>FBO, 24% to Casper Jet Center, 32% to Sterling Fort Worth, and 35% to Tucson Jet Center.</P>

<P>2.2 Apportionments.</P>

<P>The following items shall be apportioned as of 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the day of the</P>

<P>Closing: (a) real estate and personal property taxes, sewer rents and charges and other state,</P>

<P>county and municipal taxes, any other Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable</P>

<P>for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date and assessments and</P>

<P>charges affecting the Business; (b) rents and other payments under any of the Assumed</P>

<P>Liabilities; and (c) charges for water, electricity, gas, oil, steam and all other utilities (except to</P>

<P>the extent disposed of by final billing to the Sellers), all such items prior to such time being for</P>

<P>the account of the Sellers and all such items after such time being for the account of Purchaser. </P>

<P>At the Closing, the Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall deliver to the other a check for</P>

<P>the net amount owing under this section. If any such item cannot accurately be apportioned at</P>

<P>the Closing or if it is incorrectly apportioned at the Closing or subsequent thereto, such items</P>

<P>shall be apportioned or reapportioned, as the case may be, as soon as practicable after the Closing</P>

<P>Date or the date on which the apportionment error is discovered, as applicable. Any amount due</P>

<P>as a result of such reapportionment shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the final determination</P>

<P>of such amount.</P>

<P>2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price.</P>

<P>With regard to all Taxes, the allocation of the Purchase Price to the Purchased Assets shall be in</P>

<P>accordance with their fair market value and shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the Internal</P>

<P>Revenue code of 1986, as amended and the regulations thereunder (the "Code"). The parties</P>

<P>shall use their best efforts prior to Closing to reach an agreement on such allocation, but such</P>

<P>agreement shall not be a condition of the Closing. If no agreement is reached within thirty days</P>

<P>after the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to refer such matter to a nationally recognized</P>

<P>firm of independent public accountants agreed upon by Purchaser and the Sellers. The</P>

<P>determination made by such firm shall be conclusive and non-appealable. The fees and</P>

<P>disbursements of such firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and the Sellers. The Sellers and</P>

<P>Purchaser shall timely file a Form 8594 with the Internal Revenue Service in connection</P>

<P>therewith. For purposes of the Code, the Sellers and Purchaser agree to report the transactions</P>

<P>contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with such allocation. In addition,</P>

<P>Purchaser and the Sellers agree to provide each other with their respective Federal Tax</P>

<P>Identification numbers at Closing for purposes of reporting this transaction to the Internal</P>

<P>Revenue Service. </P>

<P>2.4 Transaction Related Costs and Taxes.</P>

<P>The Sellers shall bear costs relating to the assignment of the FBO Lease and obtaining the</P>

<P>Estoppel Certificate. The cost of Title Insurance shall be borne equally by Purchaser and the</P>

<P>Sellers. The Sellers shall also be responsible for all income and gains Taxes payable in</P>

<P>connection with the transfer of the Business and the Purchased Assets to Purchaser. The Sellers,</P>

<P>other than Sterling Fort Worth, agree to reimburse Purchaser for any sales tax paid by Purchaser</P>

<P>(whether, without limitation, in the form of a settlement, assessment, or judgement) in</P>

<P>connection with Purchaser's acquisition of the Purchased Assets.</P>

<P>2.5 Closing Purchase Price Escrow.</P>

<P>On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the sum of $169,000 (the "Escrow Amount") into an</P>

<P>escrow account with a third party escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the</P>

<P>Sellers (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Amount shall be available to reimburse Purchaser for</P>

<P>(a) the payment of any Excluded Liabilities for which Purchaser may become liable, (b)</P>

<P>reimbursement for any Accounts Receivable which Purchaser reconveys to the Sellers, (c) to</P>

<P>reserve against any Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to</P>

<P>indemnification by the Sellers under the terms of Article 9 of this Agreement (any such</P>

<P>reimbursable amount referred to herein as a "Purchaser Reimbursable") for the period specified</P>

<P>in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held, administrated and distributed by</P>

<P>the Escrow Agent in accordance with an escrow agreement which shall be executed and</P>

<P>delivered by Purchaser, the Sellers and Escrow Agent at the Closing in the form of Exhibit A to</P>

<P>this Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"). </P>

<P>2.6 Set-Off.</P>

<P>If the Escrow Amount is insufficient to reimburse Purchaser for any Purchaser Reimbursable,</P>

<P>the Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have against the</P>

<P>Sellers, to exercise rights of set-off against any amounts due and payable to the Sellers or an</P>

<P>Affiliate under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument executed and delivered by</P>

<P>Purchaser or the Sellers or an Affiliate of either related to the purchase and sale of the Purchased</P>

<P>Assets or the purchase and sale of the Austin Facility.</P>

<P>reimburse Purchaser for any sales tax paid by Purchaser (whether, without limitation, in the form</P>

<P>of a settlement, assessment, or judgement), in the event that the occasional sales exemption,</P>

<P>provided for by 151.304 of the Texas Tax Code, is found to be inapplicable to Purchaser's</P>

<P>ARTICLE 9 </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>INDEMNIFICATION</P>

<P>9.1 Indemnification by Sellers.</P>

<P>The Sellers agree to indemnify Purchaser and its officers, managers, partners, employees,</P>

<P>affiliates, agents, members, successors and assigns (each a "Purchaser Indemnified Party" and,</P>

<P>collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") and hold them harmless against any loss,</P>

<P>liability, deficiency, damage, expense or cost and hereby waives and covenants not to bring any</P>

<P>claim for contribution against Purchaser for, all claims and damages (including punitive</P>

<P>damages, liabilities, costs, losses, fines, penalties, demands, cost recovery actions, lawsuits,</P>

<P>administrative proceedings, orders, response action costs, compliance costs, investigation</P>

<P>expenses, consultant fees, attorneys' fees and litigation expenses) (each individually, a "Loss" and</P>

<P>collectively, "Losses") that result, either directly or indirectly, from:</P>

<P>(a) any misrepresentation in any of the representations or breach of any of the warranties of the</P>

<P>Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any agreements, exhibits, schedules, certificates or</P>

<P>annexes delivered or to be delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise</P>

<P>incorporated in this Agreement;</P>

<P>(b) any breach of, or failure to perform, any agreement or covenant of the Sellers contained in</P>

<P>this Agreement including the failure to comply with the provisions of this Article 9;</P>

<P>(c) any Claims against any of Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of the actions or inactions</P>

<P>of the Sellers or the use, ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets (i) prior to the Closing</P>

<P>with respect to the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Business or (ii) prior to or after the</P>

<P>Closing, with respect to any other business of the Sellers;</P>

<P>(d) any actions, omissions, circumstances or conditions to the extent existing prior to the Closing,</P>

<P>which arise under Environmental Laws or relate to Hazardous Materials, except to the extent the</P>

<P>Sellers demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that such facts, circumstances or</P>

<P>conditions (A) did not arise from the Sellers' operation of the Business or their occupancy of the</P>

<P>Real Property or (B) arose as a result of Purchaser's negligence, non-compliance with applicable</P>

<P>Laws, willful misconduct, operation of the Business or occupation of the Real Property after the</P>

<P>Closing Date; or</P>

<P>(e) any Excluded Liabilities;</P>

<P>All of the foregoing items in items (a) - (e) are collectively known as the "Purchaser</P>

<P>Losses."</P>

<P>9.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.</P>

<P>Purchaser agrees to indemnify the Sellers, and their officers, directors, managers, partners,</P>

<P>employees, agents, and shareholders (collectively, the "Sellers' Indemnified Parties"), and hold</P>

<P>them harmless against any Losses that any of the Sellers' Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain</P>

<P>or become subject to as a result of (a) any misrepresentation in any of the representations or</P>

<P>breaches of any of the warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (b) any breach of, or</P>

<P>failure to perform, any agreement or covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement,</P>

<P>including assuming the Assumed Liabilities and Assumed Contracts, (c) any Claims against any</P>

<P>of the Sellers' Indemnified Parties arising out of actions or inactions of Purchaser subsequent to</P>

<P>Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Business subsequent to</P>

<P>Closing, or (d) the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "Sellers' Losses").</P>

<P>9.3 Method of Asserting Claims.</P>

<P>As used herein, an "Indemnified Party" shall refer to a "Purchaser Indemnified Party" or</P>

<P>"Sellers' Indemnified Party," as applicable, the "Notifying Party" shall refer to the party entitled</P>

<P>to indemnification hereunder, and the "Indemnifying Party" shall refer to the party(ies) hereto</P>

<P>obligated to indemnify such Notifying Party's Indemnified Parties.</P>

<P>(a) In the event that any of the Indemnified Parties is made a defendant in or party to any action</P>

<P>or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any third party, the liabilities for which, or</P>

<P>the costs or expenses of which, are Sellers' Losses or Purchaser Losses, as the case may be, (any</P>

<P>such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a "Claim"), the Notifying Party shall</P>

<P>give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof. The failure to give such notice shall not</P>

<P>affect any Indemnified Party's ability to seek reimbursement except to the extent such failure</P>

<P>adversely affects the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend successfully a Claim. The</P>

<P>Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest and defend such Claim; provided, that the</P>

<P>Indemnifying Party diligently contests and defends such Claim. Such defense shall not relieve</P>

<P>the Indemnifying Party of its liability under this Article 9 for any Loss to the Notifying Party</P>

<P>relating to such Claim. Notice of the intention to contest and defend shall be given by the</P>

<P>Indemnifying Party to the Notifying Party within fifteen (15) business days after the Notifying</P>

<P>Party's notice of such Claim (but in all events as soon as possible prior to the date such Claim is</P>

<P>due to be filed). Such contest and defense shall be conducted by competent counsel employed by</P>

<P>the Indemnifying Party. The Notifying Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and</P>

<P>expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss unless the Notifying Party reasonably</P>

<P>determines that the Indemnifying Party is not adequately representing the interest of the</P>

<P>Indemnified Parties), to participate in such contest and defense and to be represented by attorneys</P>

<P>of its or their own choosing. If the Notifying Party elects to participate in such defense, the</P>

<P>Notifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such defense. </P>

<P>Neither the Notifying Party nor the Indemnifying Party may concede, settle or compromise any</P>

<P>Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld</P>

<P>or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Indemnifying Party fails or is not</P>

<P>entitled to contest and defend a Claim, the Notifying Party shall be entitled to contest, defend and</P>

<P>settle such Claim in such manner and on such terms as the Notifying Party may deem appropriate</P>

<P>and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the Losses of the Notifying Party in accordance</P>

<P>with the provisions of this Article 9.</P>

<P>(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party that</P>

<P>does not involve a Claim, the Notifying Party shall deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable</P>

<P>promptness to the Indemnifying Party. </P>

<P>9.4 Limits on Indemnification.</P>

<P>With respect to any Claims arising under Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a), the Indemnified Party shall</P>

<P>not be entitled to indemnification until the aggregate Losses, suffered by such party, or its</P>

<P>successors and assigns, in connection with any breach of this Agreement exceeds $50,000 (the</P>

<P>"Basket"), whereupon, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder from</P>

<P>the Indemnifying Party for the aggregate Losses suffered including the amount of the Basket. </P>

<P>With respect to any such claims arising under Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a), no Indemnifying Party</P>

<P>shall be liable for indemnification under this Article for amounts in the aggregate, exceeding the</P>

<P>Purchase Price (the "Indemnification Cap").</P>

<P>9.5 Survival.</P>

<P>The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any writing delivered to</P>

<P>Purchaser or the Sellers in connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date for a</P>

<P>period of three (3) years; provided however, that the representations and warranties contained in</P>

<P>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 shall survive without termination and the representations</P>

<P>and warranties contained in Sections 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 3.12 (solely with respect to unfair labor</P>

<P>practices and the conformance of the Sellers' current procedures, policies and training practices</P>

<P>with applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and other governmental requirements), 3.13, 3.15</P>

<P>and 3.16 shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. </P>

<P>9.6 Sole Remedy.</P>

<P>Except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the provisions and procedures set</P>

<P>forth in this Article 9 shall constitute the Parties' exclusive rights and remedies for any breach of</P>

<P>this Agreement.</P>

<P>9.7 Tax Treatment and Indemnity Payments.</P>

<P>All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as purchase price</P>

<P>adjustments for Tax purposes.</P>
