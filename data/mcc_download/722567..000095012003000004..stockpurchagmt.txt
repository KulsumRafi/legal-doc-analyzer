<PAGE>


                   (A) any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or

from any certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument furnished by
the Companies to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;

                   (B) any and all liabilities and obligations of either or both

                   (C) any and all liabilities and obligations of either Company
which accrued prior to the Closing Date, even if disclosed on the Balance Sheet

extent exceeding the amount accrued or reserved therefor on the Balance Sheet or
exceeding the amount thereof disclosed and attributed thereto in the Schedules
hereto; and

                   (D) any and all liabilities and obligations of the Companies
and/or Purchaser and/or any officer, director or agent of Purchaser, arising out
of any claim or controversy in respect of this Agreement or any negotiations in
connection herewith or the transactions provided for hereunder which relate to
or arise out of the matters described in the Complaint filed in that certain

                                       47
<PAGE>


              (ii) any and all actions, suits, claims, proceedings, demands,
fines, judgments, costs and other expenses (including without limitation
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incident to any of the foregoing or to the
enforcement of this Section 12.4(a).

         Any and all such damages, losses, deficiencies, actions, suits, claims,
proceedings, demands, fines, judgments, costs and other expenses (including
without limitation reasonable legal fees and expenses) are referred to herein as
"Losses". As used herein, "Responsible Stockholders" means all of the Existing
Stockholders of MCM USA other than Trefoil Tech Investors, L.P. [Shamrock], as
more particularly shown on Schedule 12.4(a) hereto.

         (b) General Indemnification Obligation of Purchaser. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Companies and the Responsible Stockholders and their successors and permitted
assigns (each an "Indemnified Company Party") against and in respect of:

              (i) any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Company Party that result from or arise out of any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of Purchaser
under this Agreement, or from any misrepresentation in or omission from any
certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument furnished by Purchaser
to the Companies pursuant to this Agreement; and

              (ii) any and all actions, suits, claims, proceedings, demands,

         (c) Method of Asserting Claims by Purchaser. In the event that any
claim or demand for which any one or more of Indemnitors would be liable to an
Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be
collected from an Indemnified Purchaser Party by a third party, the Indemnified
Purchaser Party shall promptly notify Indemnitors of such claim or demand,
specifying the nature of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated
amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice").
Indemnitors agree that a delay in the Indemnified Purchaser Party's providing
such Claim Notice shall not affect Indemnitors' indemnification obligations
hereunder, unless and except to the extent that such delay causes material
prejudice to Indemnitors. Indemnitors shall have fifteen (15) Business Days from
the giving of the Claim Notice hereunder (the "Notice Period") to notify the
Indemnified Purchaser Party, (A) whether or not they dispute their liability to
the Indemnified Purchaser Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand,
(B) notwithstanding any such dispute, whether or not such Indemnified Purchaser
Party should defend itself against such claim or demand, and be reimbursed for
reasonable expenses incurred in such defense by Indemnitors or (C)
notwithstanding any such dispute, whether or not, at their option, they intend,
at their sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Purchaser Party
against any portion of such claim or demand.

              (i) If Indemnitors dispute their liability with respect to such
claim or demand or the amount thereof (whether or not Indemnitors intend to
defend the Indemnified Purchaser Party against such claim or demand as provided
in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below), such dispute shall be resolved between the
Parties or by judicial proceeding.


                                       49
<PAGE>


              (ii) In the event that Indemnitors notify the Indemnified
Purchaser Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnified Purchaser Party
should defend itself against such claim or demand, then the Indemnified
Purchaser Party shall have the right and obligation to defend itself by
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or
prosecuted by them to a final conclusion in a reasonable manner in which the
Indemnified Purchaser Party adequately defends itself without exposing the
Indemnitors to unreasonable or unnecessary liability or excessive or
unreasonable cost; provided, however, that the Indemnified Purchaser Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitors, (A) enter into any
settlement or compromise of any claim or demand for other than monetary damages
which does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to Indemnitors a release, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnitors, from all further liability in respect of such claim
or litigation. The amount of any such claim or demand, or the portion thereof as
to which a defense of the Indemnified Purchaser Party is unsuccessful, in each
case shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of Indemnitors hereunder
(unless Indemnitors shall have disputed their liability to the Indemnified
Purchaser Party hereunder as provided in paragraph (i) above, in which event
such dispute shall be resolved between the Parties or by judicial proceeding);

              (iii) In the event that Indemnitors notify the Indemnified
Purchaser Party within the Notice Period that they intend to defend the
Indemnified Purchaser Party against a portion or all of such claim or demand,
then Indemnitors shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Purchaser Party,


                                       50
<PAGE>


to the extent stated in such notification (it being understood that any portion
of the claim or demand not defended by Indemnitors shall be the obligation of
the Indemnified Purchaser Party pursuant to Section 12.4(c)(ii) above), by
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or
prosecuted by them to a final conclusion in such a manner as to avoid any risk
of the Indemnified Purchaser Party becoming subject to liability for any other
matter; provided, however, that Indemnitors shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Purchaser Party, (A) consent to the entry of any
judgment against the Indemnified Purchaser Party, (B) enter into any settlement
or compromise of any claim or demand for other than monetary damages, or (C)
enter into any settlement or compromise of any claim or demand for monetary
damages which does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Purchaser Party of a release, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Purchaser Party,
from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If any Indemnified
Purchaser Party desires to participate in any such defense or settlement, it may
do so at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnifying Party shall have the
sole right to control such defense or settlement.

              (iv) In the event an Indemnified Purchaser Party should have a
claim against Indemnitors that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted
against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Indemnified
Purchaser Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to
Indemnitors. If such claim or demand relates to any dispute respecting the
Companies' financial statements, such claim or demand shall be made within
ninety (90) days following Purchaser's receipt of such financial statements. If
Indemnitors dispute their liability with respect to such claim or demand, such
dispute shall be resolved between the Parties or by judicial proceeding; if
Indemnitors do not notify the Indemnified Purchaser Party within the Notice
Period that they dispute such claim, the amount of such claim shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of Indemnitors hereunder.


                                       51
<PAGE>


         (d) Method of Asserting Claims by Indemnitors. In the event that any
claim or demand for which Purchaser would be liable to an Indemnified Company
Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from an
Indemnified Company Party by a third party, the Indemnified Company Party shall
promptly notify Purchaser of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of such
claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent
then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice"). Purchaser agrees that a delay in
the Indemnified Company Party's providing such Claim Notice shall not affect
Purchaser's indemnification obligations hereunder, unless and except to the
extent that such delay causes material prejudice to Purchaser. Purchaser shall
have fifteen (15) Business Days from the giving of the Claim Notice hereunder
(the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Company Party, (A) whether or
not it disputes its liability hereunder to the Indemnified Company Party with
respect to such claim or demand, and (B) notwithstanding any such dispute,
whether or not it intends, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the
Indemnified Company Party against such claim or demand.

              (i) If Purchaser disputes its liability with respect to such claim
or demand or the amount thereof (whether or not Purchaser intends to defend the
Indemnified Company Party against such claim or demand as provided in paragraphs
(ii) and (iii) below), such dispute shall be resolved between the Parties or by
judicial proceeding.

              (ii) In the event that Purchaser notifies the Indemnified Company
Party within the Notice Period that it intends to defend the Indemnified Company
Party against such claim or demand, then Purchaser shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Company Party by appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted by it to a final conclusion


                                       52
<PAGE>


in such a manner as to avoid any risk of the Indemnified Company Party becoming
subject to liability for any other matter; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Company Party,
(A) consent to the entry of any judgment against the Indemnified Company Party,
(B) enter into any settlement or compromise of any claim or demand for other
than monetary damages, or (C) enter into any settlement or compromise of any
claim or demand for monetary damages which does not include, as an unconditional
term thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Company
Party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Company Party, from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation. If any Indemnified Company Party desires to participate in any such
defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense, but the
Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to control such defense or
settlement.

              (iii) If Purchaser elects not to defend the Indemnified Company
Party against such claim or demand, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Company Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of
any such claim or demand, or if the same be defended by Purchaser or by the
Indemnified Company Party (but the Indemnified Company Party shall not have any
obligation to defend any such claim or demand), then that portion thereof as to
which such defense is unsuccessful, in each case shall be conclusively deemed to
be a liability of Purchaser hereunder, unless Purchaser shall have disputed its
liability to the Indemnified Company Party hereunder as provided in paragraph
(i) above, in which event such dispute shall be resolved between the Parties or
by judicial proceeding.


                                       53
<PAGE>


              (iv) In the event an Indemnified Company Party should have a claim
against Purchaser that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against
or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Indemnified Company
Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to
Purchaser. If Purchaser disputes its liability with respect to such claim or
demand, such dispute shall be resolved between the Parties or by judicial
proceeding; if Purchaser does not notify the Indemnified Company Party within
the Notice Period that it disputes such claim, the amount of such claim shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of Purchaser hereunder.

         (e) Payment. Upon any determination of liability under Section 12.4(c)
or 12.4(d) hereof, as the case may be, or otherwise between the Parties or by
judicial proceeding, the appropriate Party shall pay the amount of such
determined liability to the other within ten (10) Business Days after such
determination. Upon the payment or satisfaction in full of any claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified Party
against any person, firm or corporation with respect to the subject matter of
such claim.

         (f) Limitations on Indemnification. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding:

              (1) Except as provided in (2) immediately below:

                   (A) Any payment owed by the Responsible Stockholders
hereunder shall be made solely in the form of Indemnitor Stock (and the only
recourse therefor which Purchaser has against the Responsible Stockholders is to
the Indemnitor Stock, except to the extent a Responsible Stockholder may elect


                                       54
<PAGE>


to pay cash as provided herein), paid by the Responsible Stockholders based upon
their percentage interest (on a fully diluted basis) in MCM USA. For this
purpose, such Indemnitor Stock shall be valued at what Purchaser pays for the
Series A Preferred Stock under this Agreement ($72.31 per share).

                   (B) The Responsible Stockholders shall not have an obligation
to make any payment under this (1) in cash or in any other form other than in
Indemnitor Stock; provided, however, the Responsible Stockholders shall each
have the option to make any portion of such payment in cash. As used herein,
"Indemnitor Stock" means all the capital stock of MCM USA and any capital stock
equivalents (including without limitation all MCM USA options, warrants,
debentures, notes and commitments to deliver options, into shares of capital
stock of MCM USA) owned (legally or beneficially) by the Responsible
Stockholders.

              (2)

                   (A) Reference is made to the Existing Stockholders Put Option
provided for in Section 8 of the Stockholders Agreement ("Put") and the
Corporation's Call Option provided for in Section 9 of the Stockholders
Agreement ("Call").

                   (B) In the event the Put or the Call is duly exercised, but a
Claim Notice is sent by Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.4(c) hereof (either
before or after the exercise of the Put or the Call), then the "Final Amount" to
be paid on consummation of the stock redemption pursuant to the Put or the Call
shall be paid directly to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 15.11(b)), and
held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement shown in
Exhibit 15.11(b) hereto.

              (3) The indemnity obligations of Indemnitors and Purchaser are
expressly subject to the limitations on survival set forth in Article XI hereof.


                                       55

         (g) Sole Remedy. If the Closing occurs, no Party shall have any
liability to any other Party or any affiliate of any of them arising out of this
Agreement, except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
Sections 12.4(a) through 12.4(g) hereof.

                                  Article XIII
                            Confidential Information
                            ------------------------

     13.1 Confidentiality. Those persons named in Schedule 13.1 ("Key Persons")
hereto acknowledge that in the course of their relationship with the Companies,
including references to the transactions provided for in this Stock Purchase
Agreement, and/or any possible sale of either or both of the Companies to other
persons or entities, they have become familiar with certain Proprietary
Information related to the Companies. Key Persons hereby agree that they will
not disclose such Proprietary Information, directly or indirectly, or through
any corporation or other business entity utilize any such Proprietary
Information for their own benefit, or for the benefit of third parties, unless
they receive prior written authorization from Purchaser with respect thereto;
provided, however, that "Proprietary Information" does not include information
that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; (b) was available to
Key Persons on a non-confidential basis; (c) becomes available to Key Persons on
a non-confidential basis from a source who is not known to Key Persons after due
inquiry of such source to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with regard to
such information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or legal process.

     13.2 Remedy in the Event of Breach. The Parties specifically acknowledge
and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing provisions of


                                       56
<PAGE>


this Article XIII may be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to such temporary and permanent
injunctive relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may determine without the
necessity of posting a bond. In the event that the provisions of this Article
XIII should ever be deemed to exceed any limitation provided by applicable law,
then the Parties agree that such provisions shall be reformed to set forth the
maximum limitations permitted.

                                  Article XIV
                        Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition
                        ---------------------------------

     14.1 Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition. Until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, each Existing Stockholder, each Key Person, and Purchaser, shall
not, directly or indirectly:

         (a) solicit, offer employment to, or employ any Person (A) who is then
employed by either Company (other than one who is also an employee of Purchaser
or any affiliate of Purchaser), or (B) who was so employed but whose employment
terminated (without regard to why), within one year preceding such solicitation,
offer, or employment (other than one who is also an employee of Purchaser or any
affiliate of Purchaser);

         (b) solicit, offer services to, or provide services to any customer of
either Company, whether such customer was a customer of either Company prior to
the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder; or

         (c) own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, any person or entity, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, as more than a 5% owner of such


                                       57
<PAGE>


person or entity if such Person is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any
business anywhere in the world which is competitive with the Business.

     14.2 Remedy in the Event of Breach. The Parties specifically acknowledge
and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing provisions of
this Article XIV may be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to such temporary and permanent
injunctive relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may determine without the
necessity of posting a bond. In the event that any of the provisions of this
Article XIV should ever be deemed to exceed any limitations provided by
applicable law, then the Parties agree that such provisions shall be reformed to
set forth the maximum limitations permissible by such law.

                                   Article XV
                                  Miscellaneous
                                  -------------

     15.1 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by the Companies without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, or by Purchaser without the prior written consent of the
Companies, except that Purchaser may, without such consent, but with prior
notice to the Companies, assign in writing its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an affiliate of Purchaser; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
continue to be a Party to this Agreement and to be bound by the provisions
hereof. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns, and no other Person shall have any right,
benefit or obligation hereunder.

     15.3 Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted, and
the rights of the Parties determined, in accordance with the laws of the State
of New Jersey, except that (i) with respect to matters of law concerning the
internal corporate affairs of MCM USA or MCM Israel, the law of the jurisdiction
under which such corporation is incorporated shall govern; and (ii) in any
jurisdiction where the Proprietary Rights have been registered or filed, the
mandatory laws and regulations of such jurisdiction applicable to such
Proprietary Rights shall govern.

     15.4 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties hereby consent and submit to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey and any New Jersey State court of competent jurisdiction
located in Bergen County, New Jersey for any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that process
will be sufficient and effective if served in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth in Section 15.2 hereof. Provided, that this Section 15.4

agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, warranties,
representations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties, or
their officers or agents. No supplement, modification or waiver of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound
thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not
similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise

together shall constitute one and the same instrument, even where all Parties
have not signed the same counterpart so long as each Party has signed a
counterpart. The execution of the signature page by a Party and the telecopy
thereof to the adverse Party or its counsel shall constitute valid execution and
delivery of this Agreement by such sending Party.

     15.7 Invalidity. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument or document required
hereunder, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any other such
instrument or document.

limitation those contemplated under Section 10.5 hereof), in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement.

     15.10 Confidential Information; Publicity. The Parties acknowledge that the

contemplated hereby or the purchase price hereunder without the prior approval
of the other Parties.

     15.11 Trust; Escrow.
           -------------

         (a) On or about March 4, 2001, the Existing Stockholders entered into a
Trust Letter Agreement ("TLA") with Amit Pollak Matalon Trust Ltd. ("Trustee")
pursuant to which certain of their shares of stock in MCM USA were deposited
with and registered in the name of the Trustee. The number of such shares
presently held by the Trustee pursuant to the TLA and the breakdown of that
number of shares among the beneficial owners thereof is set forth on Schedule
15.11(a) hereto. A true copy of the signed TLA is attached as Exhibit 15.11(a)
hereto.

         (b) All of the shares of stock in MCM USA to be issued to the Existing
Stockholders pursuant to the conversion of debentures referenced in Sections


                                       62
<PAGE>


7.1.11 and 7.1.12 are set forth on Schedule 15.11(b) hereto; such shares will,
as of the Closing hereunder, be delivered to Thelen Reid & Priest LLP, as
"Escrow Agent", to be held in escrow pursuant to an Escrow and Administration
Agreement in the form of Exhibit 15.11(b) hereto ("EAA").

         (c) The purposes of the escrow arrangements provided for in the EAA
are: (i) to have all shares of stock in MCM USA which are subject to the Put and
Call provisions set forth in Sections 8 and 9 of the Stockholders Agreement
available for delivery on the exercise of either of such Put or such Call, and
(ii) to have all shares of stock of MCM USA owned (legally or beneficially) by
the Responsible Stockholders (and the cash proceeds of the redemption thereof as
referenced in Section 12.4(f)(2)(B)) serve as collateral for the indemnification
obligations of the Responsible Stockholders pursuant to Section 12.4 hereof. It
is agreed that at such time as the TLA is terminated, the Trustee will deliver
the shares of stock subject to the TLA to the Escrow Agent, which shares shall
be reissued in the names of the beneficial owners thereof and delivered directly
to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the EAA, or, if the Put or the Call has been exercised and the
purchase price pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement (as may be reduced as
provided therein) has been paid to the Trustee, then the Trustee will deliver
the shares of stock subject to the TLA to MCM USA.

         (d) In pursuance of the objectives reflected in (c) immediately above,
the Trustee and the Existing Stockholders will provide a Memorandum of Agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit 15.11(d) hereto, which document, fully
executed, shall be delivered to Caprius and to MCM USA at or before the Closing
hereunder.

         (e) Administrative Agent. At or before the Closing, Yotan Trust Ltd.,
an Israeli company, will enter into the EAA as Administrative Agent thereunder
(the "Administrative Agent"). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained herein, any notice to be provided to the Indemnitors, Existing
Stockholders, Responsible Stockholders and/or Key Persons, or any of them, shall
be deemed effectively given if provided to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the provisions of Section 15.2; and all actions taken by the
Administrative Agent for or on behalf of the Indemnitors, Existing Stockholders,
Responsible Stockholders and/or Key Persons hereunder shall be deemed taken by
such Parties. Each of the Companies and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on
all communications of the Administrative Agent, which communications shall in
all events be in writing, as action taken on behalf, and with the full
authorization, of the Indemnitors, Existing Stockholders, Responsible
Stockholders and/or Key Persons, as applicable. It is further agreed that in the
event of any inconsistency between the obligations of the Escrow Agent or the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and their respective obligations under
the EAA, the provisions of the EAA shall prevail.
