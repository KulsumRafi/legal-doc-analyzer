<B><P>6. &#9;Option Provisions.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) <B>Term. </B>No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) <B>Price. </B>The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c) <B>Consideration. </B>The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised, or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of the grant of the Option, (A) by delivery to the Company of other common stock of the Company, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other common stock of the Company) with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to subsection 6(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board. In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d) <B>Transferability. </B>An Incentive Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Incentive Stock Option is granted only by such person. A Nonstatutory Stock Option shall only be transferable by the Optionee upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Option Agreement for such Nonstatutory Stock Option, as the Board or the Committee shall determine in its discretion, except that each Nonstatutory Stock Option may be transferred to the spouse, children, lineal ancestors and lineal descendants of the Optionee (or to a trust created solely for the benefit of the Optionee and the foregoing persons) or to an organization exempt from taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Code or to which tax deductible charitable contributions may be made under Section 170 of the Code (excluding such organizations classified as private foundations under applicable regulations and rulings). The person to whom an Option is granted may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionee, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e) <B>Vesting. </B>The total number of shares of stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). The Option Agreement may provide that from time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable (&quot;vest&quot;) with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option became vested but was not fully exercised. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(f) <B>Termination of Employment or Relationship as a Director or Consultant. </B>In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability), the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;An Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the Option Agreement, or (ii) the tenth (10th) day after the last date on which such exercise would result in such liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Finally, an Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares would violate the registration requirements under the Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 6(f), or (ii) the expiration of a period of three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(g) <B>Disability of Optionee. </B>In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates as a result of the Optionee's disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(h) <B>Death of Optionee. </B>In the event of the death of an Optionee during, or within a period specified in the Option after the termination of, the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant, the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death) by the Optionee's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionee's death pursuant to subsection 6(d), but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the time of death, the Optionee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(i) <B>Early Exercise. </B>The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionee may elect at any time while an Employee, Director or Consultant to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Any unvested shares so purchased may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(j) <B>Re-Load Options. </B>Without in any way limiting the authority of the Board or Committee to make or not to make grants of Options hereunder, the Board or Committee shall have the authority (but not an obligation) to include as part of any Option Agreement a provision entitling the Optionee to a further Option (a &quot;Re-Load Option&quot;) in the event the Optionee exercises the Option evidenced by the Option agreement, in whole or in part, by surrendering other shares of common stock in accordance with this Plan and the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement. Any such Re-Load Option (i) shall be for a number of shares equal to the number of shares surrendered as part or all of the exercise price of such Option; (ii) shall have an expiration date which is the same as the expiration date of the Option the exercise of which gave rise to such Re-Load Option; and (iii) shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the common stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Re-Load Option which is an Incentive Stock Option and which is granted to a 10% shareholder (as described in subsection 5(c)), shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option and shall have a term which is no longer than five (5) years.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Any such Re-Load Option may be an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option, as the Board or Committee may designate at the time of the grant of the original Option; provided, however, that the designation of any Re-Load Option as an Incentive Stock Option shall be subject to the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) annual limitation on exercisability of Incentive Stock Options described in subsection 12(d) of the Plan and in Section 422(d) of the Code. There shall be no Re-Load Options on a Re-Load Option. Any such Re-Load Option shall be subject to the availability of sufficient shares under subsection 4(a) and shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Board or Committee may determine which are not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan regarding the terms of Options.</P>

<B><P>7. &#9;Terms of Stock Bonuses and Purchases of Restricted Stock.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) <B>Purchase Price. </B>The purchase price under each restricted stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such agreement but in no event shall the purchase price be less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the stock's Fair Market Value on the date such award is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company for its benefit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) <B>Transferability. </B>No rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3 and any administrative interpretations or pronouncements thereunder, so long as stock awarded under such agreement remains subject to the terms of the agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c) <B>Consideration. </B>The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either: (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d) <B>Vesting. </B>Shares of stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e) <B>Termination of Employment or Relationship as a Director or Consultant. </B>In the event a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire any or all of the shares of stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>

<B><P>8. &#9;Stock Appreciation Rights.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) The Board or Committee shall have full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan to Employees, Directors of and Consultants to the Company or its Affiliates. To exercise any outstanding Stock Appreciation Right, the holder must provide written notice of exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such right. If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted to an individual who is at the time subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (a &quot;Section 16(b) Insider&quot;), the Stock Award Agreement of grant shall incorporate all the terms and conditions at the time necessary to assure that the subsequent exercise of such right shall qualify for the safe-harbor exemption from short-swing profit liability provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule or regulation). Except as provided in subsection 5(d), no limitation shall exist on the aggregate amount of cash payments the Company may make under the Plan in connection with the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) Three types of Stock Appreciation Rights shall be authorized for issuance under the Plan:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(1) <B>Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights. </B>Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights will be granted appurtenant to an Option, and shall, except as specifically set forth in this Section 8, be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the particular Option grant to which it pertains. Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights will require the holder to elect between the exercise of the underlying Option for shares of stock and the surrender, in whole or in part, of such Option for an appreciation distribution. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercised Tandem Right shall be in cash (or, if so provided, in an equivalent number of shares of stock based on Fair Market Value on the date of the Option surrender) in an amount up to the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value (on the date of the Option surrender) of the number of shares of stock covered by that portion of the surrendered Option in which the Optionee is vested over (B) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested shares.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(2) <B>Concurrent Stock Appreciation Rights. </B>Concurrent Rights will be granted appurtenant to an Option and may apply to all or any portion of the shares of stock subject to the underlying Option and shall, except as specifically set forth in this Section 8, be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the particular Option grant to which it pertains. A Concurrent Right shall be exercised automatically at the same time the underlying Option is exercised with respect to the particular shares of stock to which the Concurrent Right pertains. The appreciation distribution payable on an exercised Concurrent Right shall be in cash (or, if so provided, in an equivalent number of shares of stock based on Fair Market Value on the date of the exercise of the Concurrent Right) in an amount equal to such portion as shall be determined by the Board or the Committee at the time of the grant of the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the Concurrent Right) of the vested shares of stock purchased under the underlying Option which have Concurrent Rights appurtenant to them over (B) the aggregate exercise price paid for such shares.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(3) <B>Independent Stock Appreciation Rights. </B>Independent Rights will be granted independently of any Option and shall, except as specifically set forth in this Section 8, be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Nonstatutory Stock Options as set forth in Section 6. They shall be denominated in share equivalents. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercised Independent Right shall be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the Independent Right) of a number of shares of Company stock equal to the number of share equivalents in which the holder is vested under such Independent Right, and with respect to which the holder is exercising the Independent Right on such date, over (B) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the grant of the Independent Right) of such number of shares of Company stock. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercised Independent Right shall be in cash or, if so provided, in an equivalent number of shares of stock based on Fair Market Value on the date of the exercise of the Independent Right.</P></DIR>

<B><P>9. &#9;Cancellation and Re-Grant of Options.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) The Board or the Committee shall have the authority to effect, at any time and from time to time, (i) the repricing of any outstanding Options and/or any Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan and/or (ii) with the consent of any adversely affected holders of Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights, the cancellation of any outstanding Options and/or any Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan and the grant in substitution therefor of (A) new Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan covering the same or different numbers of shares of stock, but having an exercise price per share not less than: eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value for a Nonstatutory Stock Option, one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value in the case of an Incentive Stock Option or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option held by a 10% shareholder (as described in subsection 5(c)), not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per share of stock on the new grant date, (B) a stock bonus, (C) the right to acquire restricted stock, (D) cash and/or (E) other valuable consideration (as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may grant an Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise price lower than that set forth above if such Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right is granted as part of a transaction to which section 424(a) of the Code applies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) Shares subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right canceled under this Section 9 shall continue to be counted against the maximum award of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights permitted to be granted pursuant to subsection 5(d) of the Plan. The repricing of an Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right under this Section 9, resulting in a reduction of the exercise price, shall be deemed to be a cancellation of the original Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right and the grant of a substitute Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right; in the event of such repricing, both the original and the substituted Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be counted against the maximum awards of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights permitted to be granted pursuant to subsection 5(d) of the Plan. The provisions of this subsection 9(b) shall be applicable only to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code.</P>

<B><P>10. &#9;Covenants of the Company.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of stock upon exercise of the Stock Award; provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;) either the Plan, any Stock Award or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.</P>

<B><P>11.&#9;Use of Proceeds from Stock.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to Stock Awards shall constitute general funds of the Company.</P>

<B><P>12. &#9;Miscellaneous.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) The Board shall have the power to accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest pursuant to subsection 6(e), 7(d) or 8(b), notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) Neither an Employee, Director or Consultant, nor any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred in accordance with the Plan, shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c) Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Employee, Director or Consultant or other holder of Stock Awards any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate or to continue acting as a Director or Consultant, or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any Employee with or without notice and with or without cause, the right of the Company's Board of Directors and/or the Company's shareholders to remove any Director pursuant to the terms of the Company's Bylaws and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the right to terminate the relationship of any Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant's agreement with the Company or Affiliate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d) To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year under all plans of the Company and its Affiliates exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the Options or portions thereof which exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e) The Company may require any person to whom a Stock Award is granted, or any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred in accordance with the Plan, as a condition of exercising or acquiring stock under any Stock Award, (1) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters, and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (2) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the stock subject to the Stock Award for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(f) To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the person to whom a Stock Award is granted may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of stock under a Stock Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (1) tendering a cash payment; (2) authorizing the Company to withhold shares from the shares of the common stock otherwise issuable to the participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award; or (3) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the common stock of the Company.</P>

<B><P>13. &#9;Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award, without the receipt of consideration by the Company (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the Plan pursuant to subsection 4(a) and the maximum number of shares subject to award to any person during any calendar year pursuant to subsection 5(c), and the outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and number of shares and price per share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards. Such adjustments shall be made by the Board or the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a &quot;transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company&quot;.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) In the event of: (1) a dissolution, liquidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company; (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation; or (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise, then to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) any surviving corporation or an Affiliate of such surviving corporation shall assume any Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar Stock Awards for those outstanding under the Plan, or (ii) such Stock Awards shall continue in full force and effect. In the event any surviving corporation and its Affiliates refuse to assume or continue such Stock Awards, or to substitute similar options for those outstanding under the Plan, then, with respect to Stock Awards held by persons then performing services as Employees, Directors or Consultants, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised shall be accelerated and the Stock Awards terminated if not exercised prior to such event.</P>

<B><P>14.&#9; Amendment of the Plan and Stock Awards.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Section 13 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the adoption of the amendment, where the amendment will:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(i) Increase the number of shares reserved for Stock Awards under the Plan;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(ii) Modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan (to the extent such modification requires shareholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code); or</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(iii) Modify the Plan in any other way if such modification requires shareholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code or to comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) The Board may in its sole discretion submit any other amendment to the Plan for shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c) It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide eligible Employees, Directors or Consultants with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to Incentive Stock Options and/or to bring the Plan and/or Incentive Stock Options granted under it into compliance therewith.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(d) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted and (ii) such person consents in writing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(e) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the terms of any one or more Stock Award; provided, however, that the rights and obligations under any Stock Award shall not be impaired by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted and (ii) such person consents in writing.</P>

<B><P>15. &#9;Termination or Suspension of the Plan.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless sooner terminated, the Plan shall terminate ten (10) years from the date the Plan is adopted by the Board or approved by the shareholders of the Company, whichever is earlier. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.</P>

<B><P>16. &#9;Effective Date of Plan.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Plan shall become effective on the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the Company's initial public offering of shares of common stock, but no Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall be exercised unless and until the Plan has been approved by the shareholders of the Company, which approval shall be within twelve (12) months before or after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board.</P>
