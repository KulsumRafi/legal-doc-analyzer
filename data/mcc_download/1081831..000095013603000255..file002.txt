                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 31, 2003, by
and between 9278 Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
and NTSE Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Holding").

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Holding and the Board of
Directors of the Company have each approved, and deem it advisable and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate, the acquisition
of Holding by the Company through the merger transaction, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions, set forth herein; and

                  WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Board of
Directors of Holding and the Board of Directors of the Company have each
approved this Agreement and the merger of Holding with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of this Agreement and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL");

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                             ARTICLE I - THE MERGER


                  Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Holding shall be merged with and into
the Company (the "Merger") and the separate corporate existence of Holding shall
cease. After the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger
shall have the effect as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the Merger, all the
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Holding
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all obligations, duties, debts and
liabilities of the Company and Holding shall be the obligations, duties, debts
and liabilities of the Surviving Corporation.

                  Section 1.2 Effective Time. At the time of the Closing (as
defined in Section 1.3 hereof), Holding and the Company will cause an
appropriate Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed
and


                                       1
<PAGE>


thereafter to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Secretary of State") in such form and executed as provided in the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective on the date on which the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State or, if another effective date is
agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, then on
such specified date, and such date is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time."

                  Section 1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date (the "Closing Date") to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VI hereof, at the offices of Snow Becker Krauss PC, 605 Third Avenue, New York,
NY 10158, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

                  Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws. Pursuant to
the Merger, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law, and (b)
the by-laws of Holding, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "By-laws"), shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

                  Section 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. Following the Merger, the directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Following the
Merger, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors have been elected or appointed or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.



                    ARTICLE II -CONVERSION, CANCELLATION AND
                    SURRENDER OF SHARES; MERGER CONSIDERATION

                  Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
of any shares of the Company's Common Stock, $.001 par value (a "Company Share"
or "Company


                                       2
<PAGE>

Shares") or the holders of shares of Holding's common stock, no par value (the
"Newco Common Stock"):

                  (a) Each Company Share which is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) Company Shares, if any,
to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) hereof and (ii) Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.4 hereof) if any, shall, from and after the
Effective Time be converted into the right to receive the sum of ten cents
(US$0.10) (the "Merger Consideration"). All Company Shares, as so converted,
shall, from and after the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Company Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.2 below. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
2.1(a) shall be made net of applicable withholding taxes to the extent such
withholding is required by law.

                  (b) Each issued and outstanding share of Holding Common Stock
which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) All Company Shares, if any, that are held by the Company
as treasury stock shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and shall
cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

                  Section 2.2  Appointment of Paying Agent; Surrender of
Certificates; Payment of Merger Consideration

                  (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall designate a bank,
trust company or stock transfer agent to act as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") in connection with the Merger. The Paying Agent shall be reasonably
acceptable to Holding, and the Company and Holding shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent, satisfactory to the parties and their attorneys, under
which the Paying Agent shall receive and pay the funds constituting Merger
Consideration, to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) hereof, and shall take the other actions set forth in this
Article II.

                  (b) Prior to the Closing, Holding will take such steps as are
necessary in order to ensure that (i) Holding has, as of the Closing, not less
than $1,250,000 in available cash balances and tangible net worth, and (ii) that
such cash balances will be available to and become the property of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after completion of the Closing. Immediately after the


                                       3
<PAGE>

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver such funds to the Paying
Agent to hold and to use as necessary to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Paragraph (c) of this Section 2.2.
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation and any balance remaining unused for paying the Merger Consideration
after three months from the Effective Time may be refunded to the Surviving
Corporation at its option; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable for any cash payments required to be made thereafter pursuant to
Section 2.1 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to any former holder of the Company Shares for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

                  (c) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
instruct the Paying Agent to promptly mail, to each record holder of a
certificate or certificates ("Certificate" or "Certificates") which represented
Company Shares prior to the Effective Time, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Holding
may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate, to be mailed to such
holder promptly following the receipt of any such Certificate and such executed
letter of transmittal. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing (i) Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company or (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4)) shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.



                                       4
<PAGE>


                  (d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person (as
defined in Section 3.1) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this Article II, provided that the Person to whom
the Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the payment
thereof, give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or
otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                  (e) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers whatsoever
recorded or permitted on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any Company Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

                  Section 2.3 Stock Options. Holding and the Company each
warrant and represent that no options, warrants, calls, preemptive or other
rights to purchase or acquire their respective securities shall be issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

                  Section 2.4 Dissenter's Rights. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has delivered a written demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
Company Shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section
2.1(a) hereof. Such holders shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders who
shall have failed to perfect, or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost,
their rights to appraisal under such Section 262 shall thereupon be treated as
if such Dissenting Shares had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (in accordance with Section 2.1(a)
hereof) to which such holder is entitled, without interest or dividends thereon.
The Company shall give Holding prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, and, prior to the Effective Time,
Holding shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written


                                       5
<PAGE>

consent of Holding, make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle, any
such demands.


                  ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                 OF THE COMPANY

                  The Company represents and warrants to Holding, as of the date
hereof and as of and at the Closing Date, as follows:

                  Section 3.1 Organization. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (hereinafter defined) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation as set forth on Schedule 3.1, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns real property or
in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
individually and in the aggregate would not have or result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The term "Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial
or otherwise) or business prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or
violation of any of its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents. The term "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
Person, any corporation or other entity of which 50% or more of the securities
or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power for the election
of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such entity
is directly or indirectly owned by such Person. The term "Person" means any
natural person, firm, individual, partnership, joint venture, business trust,
trust, association, corporation, company, unincorporated entity or Governmental
Entity (as defined in Section 3.4(b)).

                  Section 3.2 Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (a) 40,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, of which 23,932,912 are issued and outstanding, and (b)
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are issued and outstanding.
All the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no existing (i) options,
warrants, calls, preemptive rights, subscriptions or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements or commitments of any character obligating the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock
of, or other


                                       6
<PAGE>

equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (ii)
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The list of the Company's
stockholders prepared by the Company's stock transfer agent shows that Kapadia
("Kapadia"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, is the holder of record of
12,705,125 Company Shares and the beneficial holder of an additional 260,500
Company Shares.

                  Section 3.3 Authorization; Validity of Agreement and
Certificate of Designation.

                  (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to approval of its
stockholders as contemplated by Sections 5.6 and 6(1)(c) hereof, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") and, other than approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
contemplated by Sections 5.6 and 6.1(c) hereof, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Holding, is a valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting
creditors' rights generally, and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

                  (b) The Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called
and held, has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Company Shares which are
not beneficially owned by Kapadia, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and such
approval is sufficient to satisfy the provisions of any applicable laws of the
State of Delaware, and (iii) resolved to recommend the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company's stockholders.



                                       7
<PAGE>

                  Section 3.4  No Violations; Consents and Approvals.

                  (a) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with,
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or to the imposition of any lien) under,
or result in the acceleration or trigger of any payment, time of payment,
vesting, or increase in the amount of any compensation or benefit payable
pursuant to, the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, guarantee or other evidence of indebtedness, lease, license,
contract, agreement, plan or other instrument or obligation to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
assets may be bound or (iii) conflict with or violate any federal, state, local
or foreign order, writ, injunction, judgment, award, decree, statute, law, rule
or regulation (collectively, "Laws") applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), for such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
liens which individually and in the aggregate would not have or result in a
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (b) No filing or registration with, declaration or
notification to, or order, authorization, consent or approval of, any federal,
state, local or foreign court, legislative, executive or regulatory authority or
agency (a "Governmental Entity") or any other Person is required in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
(i) applicable requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State and (iii) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
notifications, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to
be obtained or made, individually and in the aggregate, would not have or result
in a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  Section 3.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements. The Company
has filed with the SEC all forms and documents required to be filed by it since
January 1, 1998 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act") and the Exchange Act and has heretofore made available to Holding (i) its
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31,


                                       8
<PAGE>

1999, 2000 and 2001 and (ii) all other forms, reports and registration
statements filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1999. The
documents described in the preceding sentence (whether filed before, on or after
the date hereof) are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Company
SEC Documents". As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents (a) did

person is or will be entitled to any brokers' or finders' fee or any other
commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Holding and the Company shall
indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations with respect to any such fees, commissions or
expenses asserted by any person, on the basis of any act or statement alleged to
