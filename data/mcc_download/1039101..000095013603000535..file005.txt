                        (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
                             this Subsidiary Guarantee would constitute or

                             conveyance or similar law of any relevant
                             jurisdiction, the liability of each Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary under this Supplemental Indenture and
                             its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be reduced to the
                             maximum amount permissible under such fraudulent
                             conveyance or similar law.

                  3.    EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES.

                        (a)  To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in
                             this Supplemental Indenture, each Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary hereby agrees that a notation of such
                             Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form of
                             Exhibit F to the Indenture shall be endorsed by an
                             officer of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary on each
                             Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
                             after the date hereof.

                        (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary hereby agrees that its Subsidiary
                             Guarantee set forth herein shall remain in full
                             force and effect notwithstanding any failure to
                             endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary
                             Guarantee.

                        (c)  If an Officer whose signature is on this
                             Supplemental Indenture or on the Subsidiary
                             Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time
                             the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a
                             Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary
                             Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.

                        (d)  The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the
                             authentication thereof under the Indenture, shall
                             constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee
                             set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf
                             of each Guaranteeing Subsidiary.

                        (e)  Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees that its
                             obligations hereunder shall be unconditional,
                             regardless of the validity, regularity or
                             enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the
                             absence of any action to enforce the same, any
                             waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with
                             respect to any provisions of the Notes or the
                             Indenture, the recovery of any judgment against the
                             Company, any action to enforce the same or any
                             other

                             circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
                             legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
                             guarantor.

                        (f)  Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby waives
                             diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing
                             of claims with a court in the event of insolvency
                             or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require
                             a proceeding first against the Company, protest,
                             notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants
                             that its Subsidiary Guarantee made pursuant to this
                             Supplemental Indenture will not be discharged
                             except by complete performance of the obligations
                             contained in the Notes and the Indenture.

                        (g)  If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any
                             court or otherwise to return to the Company or any
                             Guaranteeing Subsidiary, or any Custodian, Trustee,
                             liquidator or other similar official acting in
                             relation to either the Company or such Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary, any amount paid by either to the
                             Trustee or such Holder, the Subsidiary Guarantee
                             made pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture, to
                             the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
                             reinstated in full force and effect.

                        (h)  Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that it shall
                             not be entitled to any right of subrogation in
                             relation to the Holders in respect of any
                             obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full
                             of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each
                             Guaranteeing Subsidiary further agrees that, as
                             between such Guaranteeing Subsidiary, on the one
                             hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other
                             hand:

                             (i)  the maturity of the obligations guaranteed
                                  hereby may be accelerated as provided in
                                  Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of
                                  the Subsidiary Guarantee made pursuant to this
                                  Supplemental Indenture, notwithstanding any
                                  stay, injunction or other prohibition
                                  preventing such acceleration in respect of the
                                  obligations guaranteed hereby; and

                             (ii) in the event of any declaration of
                                  acceleration of such obligations as provided
                                  in Article 6 of the Indenture, such
                                  obligations (whether or not due and payable)
                                  shall forthwith become due and payable by such
                                  Guaranteeing Subsidiary for the purpose of the
                                  Subsidiary Guarantee made pursuant to this
                                  Supplemental Indenture.

                        (i)  Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall have the right
                             to seek contribution from any other non-paying
                             Guaranteeing Subsidiary so long as the exercise of
                             such right does not impair the rights of the
                             Holders or the Trustee under the Subsidiary
                             Guarantee made pursuant to this Supplemental
                             Indenture.

                             been merged, or by the corporation which shall have
                             acquired such property and (ii) immediately after

                             each Guaranteeing Subsidiary, such successor
                             corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for
                             such Guaranteeing Subsidiary with the same effect
                             as if it had been named herein as the Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary. Such successor corporation thereupon
                             may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary

                             the Trustee. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so
                             issued shall in all respects have the same legal
                             rank and benefit under the Indenture and this
                             Supplemental Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees
                             theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance
                             with the terms of the Indenture and this
                             Supplemental Indenture as though all of such
                             Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date
                             of the execution hereof.

                  5.    RELEASES.

                             applicable, all of the Capital Stock of a

                             shall be released; provided that in the event of an
                             Asset Sale, the Net Proceeds from such sale or
                             other disposition are treated in accordance with
                             the provisions of Section 4.10 of the Indenture. If
                             the assets sold in such sale or other disposition
                             include all or substantially all of the assets of a

                             assets of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary) shall be
                             released from and relieved of its obligations under
                             this Supplemental Indenture and its Subsidiary
                             Guarantee made pursuant hereto; provided that in
                             the event of an Asset Sale, the Net Proceeds from
                             such sale or other disposition are treated in
                             accordance with the provisions of Section 4.10 of
                             the Indenture. Upon delivery by the Company to the
                             Trustee of an Officers' Certificate to the effect
                             that such sale or other disposition was made by the
                             Company or the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as the case
                             may be, in accordance with the provisions of the
                             Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture,
                             including without limitation, Section 4.10 of the
                             Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any documents
                             reasonably required in order to evidence the
                             release of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary from its
                             obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and
                             its Subsidiary Guarantee made pursuant hereto. If
                             the Guaranteeing Subsidiary is not released from
                             its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, it
                             shall remain liable for the full amount of
                             principal of and interest on the Notes and for the
                             other

                                                                               7


                             obligations of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary under
                             the Indenture as provided in this Supplemental
                             Indenture.

                        (b)  Upon the designation of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary
                             as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
                             the terms of the Indenture, such Guaranteeing
                             Subsidiary shall be released and relieved of its
                             obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this
                             Supplemental Indenture. Upon delivery by the
                             Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate
                             and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
                             designation of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary as an
                             Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Company in
                             accordance with the provisions of the Indenture,
                             including without limitation Section 4.07 of the
                             Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any documents
                             reasonably required in order to evidence the
                             release of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary from its
                             obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee. Any
                             Guaranteeing Subsidiary not released from its
                             obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall
                             remain liable for the full amount of principal of
                             and interest on the Notes and for the other
                             obligations of any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under
                             the Indenture as provided herein.

                  6.    NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of any
Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations
of the Company or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Subsidiary
Guarantees, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is
against public policy.

                  7.    SUBORDINATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES; ANTI-LAYERING.
No Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or
otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in
right of payment to any Senior Debt of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary and senior in
any respect in right of payment to any of the Subsidiary Guarantees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Subsidiary Guarantee of each
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall be subordinated to the prior payment in full of
all Senior Debt of that Guaranteeing Subsidiary (in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Notes are subordinated to Senior Debt), which shall include
all guarantees of Senior Debt.

                  8.    THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  9.    COUNTERPARTS. The parties may sign any number of copies
of this Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all
of them together represent the same agreement.
