made at any time. If the Closing occurs, Buyer will have no liability (for

10.5 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT--SELLERS

Sellers will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect
to the matters described in clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 10.2 until the
total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars
($50,000.00) (the "Threshold


                                       22
<PAGE>


Amount"), and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed the
Threshold Amount. All Damages shall be reduced by the amount of (i) any tax
savings resulting from the indemnified matter to which such costs relate which
are actually realized by the Indemnified Person and (ii) any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Person in respect of the indemnified matter
to which such costs relate. In no event shall the liability of Sellers hereunder
exceed the Consideration. However, Section 10.5 will not apply to any Breach of
any of Sellers' representations and warranties of which Sellers had Knowledge at

by the Sellers Indemnified Person in respect of the indemnified matter to which
such costs relate. In no event shall the liability of Buyer hereunder exceed the
Consideration. However, Section 10.6 will not apply to any Breach of any of
Buyer's representations and warranties of which Buyer had Knowledge at any time
prior to the Closing Date.

10.7 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10.2 or 10.3 of
notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified party
will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section,
give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the
failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party
of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is
prejudiced by the indemnifying party's failure to give such notice.

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.7 (a) is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent
that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such
Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its


                                       23
<PAGE>


financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with
respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from
the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this
Section 10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to
the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected
by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party's consent unless (A)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may
be made against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (ii) the
indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims effected without its consent.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which
it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified
party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will
not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise
or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld).

(d) Sellers and Buyer hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person or Sellers
Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Person or
Sellers Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such
Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that process may be served
on it with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

10.8 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--OTHER CLAIMS

be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.
