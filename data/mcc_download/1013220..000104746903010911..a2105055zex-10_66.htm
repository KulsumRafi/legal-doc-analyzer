WELLPOINT 401(k) RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN<BR>
(As Amended Through March 1, 2002)  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WellPoint 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan ("Plan"), as amended through March 1, 2002, is further amended effective as of the dates provided below (i) to
authorize Participants age 50 and over to make Catch Up Contributions (as defined below) and (ii) to increase the maximum deferral percentage permitted for the Plan Year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
first sentence of Section 5.01 governing Salary Deferral Contributions is amended as follows, effective for payroll periods beginning after April 6, 2003, to increase
the maximum contribution per payroll period to 50%. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Subject
to Section 18.06, a Participant may elect to have a Participating Company reduce the amount of his or her Compensation for each payroll period from 1% to 50% and to have that amount
contributed to the Plan as a Salary Deferral Contribution on his or her behalf, effective for payroll periods beginning after March 23, 2003. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
new subsection (d) is added at the end of Section 5.01, effective for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, to authorize an additional contribution for
Participants who attain age 50 by the end of the Plan Year, as permitted under changes made by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the percentage limit or dollar limits described above, a Participant who is not less than age 50 by the end of a Plan Year beginning on or after January
1, 2003 may contribute an additional amount of Salary Deferral Contributions (referred to as "Catch Up Contributions"), up to the limit described in Code Section 414(v) as in effect for the Plan Year
in which the Catch Up Contribution is made, consistent with procedures established by the Committee. Catch Up Contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of the provisions of the Plan
implementing
the required limitations of Code Sections 402(g) and 415. The Plan will not be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of the Plan that implement the requirements of Code Sections 401(k)(3),
401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 410(b) or 416, as applicable, because of authorizing such Catch Up Contributions. </FONT></P>

Contribution (not taking into account any Catch Up Contributions) that the Participant directed during the Plan Year, while eligible for Matching Contributions as provided in Section 5.02(g) of the
Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>For
Participants with 10 or more but less than 20 Years of Service at the beginning of the first payroll period ending on or after January 1, 1997, Matching Contributions will equal 85% of the Salary
Deferral Contribution (not taking into account any Catch Up Contributions) that the Participant directed during the Plan Year, while eligible for Matching Contributions as provided in Section 5.02(g)
of the Plan. For Participants with 20 or more Years of Service at the beginning of the first payroll period ending on or after January 1, 1997, Matching Contributions will equal 100 % of the Salary
Deferral Contribution (not taking into account any Catch Up Contributions) that the Participant directed during the Plan Year, while eligible for Matching Contributions as provided in Section 5.02(g)
