                  right to eliminate any one of the Properties from the pool of
                  Properties for any reason."

4. A new Additional Application Provision Number 12 is hereby added to the
Application as follows:

                  "12. Additional Leasing Requirement For Bristol Commerce Park.
                  The funding of the Loan secured by the Bristol Commerce Park
                  property is further conditioned on: (a) a lease (the "Wal-Mart
                  Lease") being in place with Wal-Mart, as tenant, for not less
                  than 118,000 s.f. of space at said property, for a term of not
                  less than 10-years, and at an annual rent of not less than
                  $4.90 per s.f.; and (b) Wal-Mart being in occupancy of, and
                  paying rent for, the space covered by the Wal-Mart Lease. The
                  Wal-Mart Lease shall also be subject to MetLife's Approval. In
                  the event that the foregoing requirements of occupancy by
                  Wal-Mart are not satisfied, the Borrower shall at the Closing
                  deposit $2,000,000.00 with MetLife, which amount shall be held
                  in escrow by MetLife pursuant to an escrow agreement Approved
                  by MetLife. The escrow funds shall be released to the Borrower
                  upon occupancy by Wal-Mart."

This letter shall also confirm that interest shall accrue on the Loans secured
by the Additional Properties effective on the day of the Closing at an annual
interest rate equal to not less than (a) the sum of (i) 200 basis points (2.0%)
plus (ii) the yield on securities issued by the United States Treasury having a
maturity equal to 10-years as determined by MetLife's Treasury Trading Desk on
the Business Day MetLife receives this letter executed by Borrower, together
with the pledge (as clarified below) of the Additional Deposit (as defined
below), or (b) 5.90%.

For purposes hereof, the term "Additional Deposit" shall mean Series D preferred
stock of Kramont Realty Trust or cash or a Letter of Credit having a market
value of not less than $2,220,000 on the date that this letter is returned to
MetLife. The Additional Deposit shall be deposited in escrow by the Borrower and
pledged to MetLife (pursuant to a pledge agreement Approved by MetLife) and
shall be considered and treated as part of the Deposit under the Application.
The pledge agreement shall require that additional preferred stock shall, upon
the request of MetLife, be deposited in escrow by the Borrower in order to
ensure that the market value of said stock does not fall below $2,220,000.00 at
any time prior to the Closing.

Re:   $190,000,000 Mortgage Loan Application - Multiple Properties

Dear Mr. Meshon:

Please find enclosed the Mortgage Loan Application, which has been accepted by
MetLife as of the date hereof, provided, however, that the following change is
made:

1. A new Additional Application Provision Number 13 is hereby added to the
Application as follows:

                  "13. Additional Environmental Insurance Requirement.
                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Application or
                  in the Closing Requirements, the following environmental
                  insurance requirement shall be required to be complied with by
                  the Borrower prior to the Closing with respect to each of the
                  Properties: (a) Borrower shall obtain an environmental
                  insurance policy covering each of the Properties, with such
                  policy naming MetLife as an additional insured, in form, scope
                  and substance and with an insurance carrier, subject to
                  MetLife's Approval (not to be unreasonably withheld); (b) the
                  amount of the policy shall be not less than $10,000,000.00 in
                  the aggregate, and $3,000,000.00 per occurrence, and with a
                  deductible of not more than $500,000.00; (c) the policy shall
                  be in effect for the entire term of the Loans, however, the
                  initial term of the policy may be for at least 1-year,
                  provided that all renewals of the policy are for not less than
                  5-years; and (d) the failure of the Borrower to maintain such
                  policy in full force and effect for the term of the Loans, as
                  aforesaid, shall constitute an event of default under the Loan
                  Documents."

To indicate your agreement with the foregoing, please sign the duplicate
original of this letter where indicated below and return it to us on or before
October 28, 2002.
