account, called the Offset Account, shall be established and maintained by Exult for purposes of effecting certain reductions in obligations Exult has or may incur to Campbell or his estate or successors. As of the date of this Agreement, the Offset
Account balance equals the amounts listed in Part 2 of Schedule A. The Offset Account balance will be increased from time to time by the amount of all Payments and Net Proceeds. In addition, if an event or circumstance calling for application of the
Offset Account occurs (a &#147;Pending Event&#148;), the balance of the Offset Account is zero, and Campbell or his successor owns any vested shares of stock issued to him pursuant to the RSA (&#147;Vested Shares&#148;), then Exult may specify by
notice to Campbell a date at least ten days after the date of the notice for application of the Offset Account to the Pending Event as described in <U>Section 5(b)</U>. On that date, if the balance of the Offset Account is still zero, or if any
additional Net Proceeds generated from Sale of Vested Shares has been added to the Offset Account but the balance thereof is not sufficient to offset the cost to Exult of the Pending Event pursuant to <U>Section 5(b)</U> and Campbell or his
successor still owns Vested Shares, then the Offset Account will be deemed to include an amount (a &#147;Vested Share Adjustment Amount&#148;) equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the amount required to offset the cost to Exult of the
Pending Event pursuant to <U>Section 5(b)</U> exceeds the balance of the Offset Account, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of all the Vested Shares still owned on that date by Campbell or his successor. The Vested Share Adjustment Amount will be
applied in the same manner as the Offset Account balance. Immediately following any application of a Vested Share Adjustment Amount as described above, a number of Vested Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing that Vested Share Adjustment
Amount by the Fair Market Value per share will be considered to be &#147;Applied Shares.&#148; Once a Vested Share becomes an Applied Share, that share and any proceeds from its subsequent transfer will no longer be subject to the Offset Account,
even if the share is later sold for proceeds or Net Proceeds in excess of the Fair Market Value earlier applied as described herein. For these purposes, &#147;Fair Market Value&#148; of a share means the arithmetic mean of the closing price as
reported in <I>The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition)</I> for a share of Exult&#146;s common stock on the Nasdaq National Market, or such other exchange or system as may then represent the primary market for trading in Exult&#146;s common stock,
for each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the date the Offset Account is applied to the Pending Application, or if that date is not a trading day, then on the last trading day preceding the date the Offset Account is applied to the
Pending Application. For purposes of the Offset Account, if Campbell owns both Vested Shares and other shares of Exult common stock, Vested Shares shall be </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

assigns, other than Excluded Consideration, whether or not in connection with or following termination of Campbell&#146;s employment for any reason, Exult may in its discretion by written notice to Campbell reduce such payments, benefits or other
consideration by any amount up to the total balance of the Offset Account. Any such reduction shall be applied on the date specified by Exult in the notice referred to in the preceding sentence. For these purposes, (i) &#147;Exult Indemnitee&#148;
means any person or entity that may have or incur an obligation to Campbell or Campbell&#146;s successors or assigns in respect of which Exult or any of Exult&#146;s Affiliates is required to provide indemnity or other payment, and (ii)
&#147;Excluded Consideration&#148; means (A) amounts payable by Exult to Campbell pursuant to this Agreement or any of the agreements referenced in <U>Section 4</U>, (B) salary, (C) indemnification of Campbell in his capacity as an officer or
employee of Exult or any of its affiliates that Exult is legally obligated to provide Campbell, (D) expense reimbursement, (E) standard benefits to which Campbell is entitled pursuant to applicable Exult policies, including without limitation 401(k)
matching, and (F) anything that is determined by Exult in the future to be Excluded Consideration. The Offset Account balance will be reduced Dollar-for-Dollar by all amounts applied to offset Exult obligations pursuant to this <U>Section 5(b)</U>,
with portions of the Offset Account attributable to Net Proceeds deemed exhausted before portions attributable to Payments are used, and portions attributable to Payments exhausted before use of Vested Shares. In addition, the Offset Account balance
will be reduced Dollar-for-Dollar by damages paid by Campbell to Exult as a result of any breach by Campbell of his covenant regarding resignation set forth in Section 9(a) of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between Campbell and Exult.

agreements referenced in <U>Section 4</U> are entered into by Exult at Campbell&#146;s request and are intended by Exult as a retention arrangement to avoid a need Campbell may otherwise have had to seek alternative employment. Campbell&#146;s
covenant regarding resignation set forth in Section 9(a) of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between Campbell and Exult is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Such covenant is the primary component of the consideration by Campbell
for this Agreement and an essential condition to Exult&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement, and Campbell&#146;s ongoing service to Exult for the entire period until December 31, 2005 is considered critical to Exult&#146;s business
purposes. Accordingly, for purposes of determining Exult&#146;s damages and remedies in case of breach of that covenant by Campbell, time worked by Campbell prior to resignation in violation of the covenant will not be considered to be partial
performance of the covenant, and no value will be deemed to have been conferred upon Exult by virtue of such time worked by Campbell prior to resignation. The timing of Payments corresponds in general terms to Campbell&#146;s liquidity needs as
reported to Exult and should not be construed as payment for partial satisfaction of the covenant set forth in Section 9(a) of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

Campbell agrees to such proposed rules and guidelines, Exult will pay on Campbell&#146;s behalf or advance to Campbell all of Campbell&#146;s reasonable costs incurred in the Proceedings. Campbell&#146;s acceptance of such payments or advances will
