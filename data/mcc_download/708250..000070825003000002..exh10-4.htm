<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</U>:</P>
<P>&#9;A. Landlord is the owner of that certain real property more fully
described on Exhibit "A", attached hereto and by this reference incorporated
herein.</P>
<P>&#9;B. The Property is located at 1025 W. 1700 N., Logan, Cache County, Utah
and consists of ground and improvements, including a newly constructed building
containing 25,000 square feet. The land and improvements are collectively called
the "Property" herein.</P>
<P>&#9;C.&#9;Tenant is desirous of leasing the Property from Landlord, and
Landlord is desirous of leasing the Property to the Tenant.</P>
<P>&#9;D. Landlord and Tenant have communicated to one another the above-
described circumstances, and have heretofore negotiated the terms of this
Agreement and desire to memorialize the same by this instrument.</P>
<P>&#9;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, the covenants and
promises hereinafter set forth, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Landlord and Tenant
hereby agree as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE I - LEASE</P>
<P>&#9;1.01. <U>Lease of Property</U>. In consideration of the rents, covenants
and agreements hereinafter set forth, Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and
Tenant hereby rents from Landlord, the Property, together with all improvements
and fixtures presently associated therewith. </P>
<P>&#9;1.02. <U>Term</U>. The term of this Lease shall be for a total period of
five (5) years, commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending five years
from the date hereof, plus any additional periods that the parties may agree
upon pursuant to Paragraph 1.03, below.</P>
<P>&#9;1.03. <U>Additional Periods</U>. Tenant and Landlord shall have the right
to negotiate for additional periods or extensions of this Lease on terms
agreeable to the parties. </P>
<P>&#9;1.04. <U>Lease Payments</U>. Tenant agrees to pay, and Landlord agrees to
accept as lease payments $10,500.00 on June 1, 2002 and $10,500.00 on the 1st
day of each month thereafter throughout the lease term. This represents
$.42/square foot/month based on the 25,000 square foot building.</P>
<P>&#9;1.05. <U>Rent Increase</U>. The monthly rent described in paragraph 1.04
shall be increased, effective on the first day of the next month, by the
percentage increase, if any, which has occurred in the Consumer Price Index
between June 1, 2002 and November 30, 2004. Such percentage increase shall be
determined by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as
issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of
Labor, or its successor, published for "All Items" "U.S. City Average" (1982-84
= 100). The index numbers to be used for the purposes of this Section shall be
those in effect for the dates described above and if such Index shall be
converted to a different standard reference base or shall otherwise be revised,
the percentage increase shall be made with the use of such conversion factors,
formula or tables as may be published for such purpose. Each one (point) percent
(1%) in the CPI shall result in a one percent (1%) increase in the rental amount
due.</P>
<P>&#9;1.06.&nbsp;<U>Delinquent Payment</U>.&nbsp;On any payment due hereunder
which is not made on the due date thereof or within fifteen (15) days
thereafter, the Tenant agrees to pay a late charge of five percent (5%) of the
unpaid amount of such installment to cover the additional expense of handling
and processing such delinquent payment or payments. Said late charge shall be
paid at the time the delinquent amount is paid in addition to and as a condition
to Landlord accepting such delinquent payment. In addition, such unpaid amount
shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date
delinquent until paid.</P>

<P>&#9;2.01. <U>Use Of The Leased Property</U>. </P>
<P>&#9;a. Tenant may use the Property for any legal use so long as such use does
not waste or pollute the Property.</P>
<P>&#9;b. The Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about, or
bring or keep anything in the Property which will, in any way or to any extent
adversely affect any fire, liability or other insurance policy carried with
respect to the building, conflict with or violate any law, statute, ordinance,
rule, regulation or requirement of any governmental unit, agency or authority
(whether existing or enacted as promulgated in the future, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen) or damage the structural soundness of the Building, or
any part thereof.</P>
<P>&#9;c. Tenant will keep the Property and every part thereof in a clean, neat,

all respects and at all times fully comply with all health and policy
regulations, and will not suffer, permit, or commit any waste. </P>
<P>&#9;2.02. <U>Improvements by Tenant</U>. All repairs to and improvements on
the Property shall be made by the Tenant at the Tenant's expense. The Tenant
shall not make any alterations or improvements in or to the Property without the

withheld. All fixed alterations and improvements made or added to the Property,
such as carpets, cabinets and other attached equipment and fixtures (excluding
trade fixtures, phone system and related accessories and other equipment used in
Tenant's business or subleased) shall belong to the Landlord at the expiration
or termination of this Lease. </P>
<P>&#9;2.03. <U>Repair and Maintenance</U>. </P>
<P>&#9;a. Subject to 2.03e below, tenant hereby accepts the Property in the
condition it is in at the beginning of this Lease. Tenant shall at all times
during the term hereof, and any extensions thereof, keep the Property in good
repair and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. </P>
<P>&#9;b. The Landlord shall not be liable for any damage or injury by water,
which may be sustained by Tenant or other person or for any other damage or
injury resulting from the carelessness, negligence, or improper conduct on the
part of any other Tenant or agents, or employees, or by reason of the breakage,
leakage or obstruction of the water or sewer, pipes, or other leakage in or
about the said building or caused by weight of snow or ice or any other damage
caused by the elements.</P>
<P>&#9;c. Except as specifically otherwise provided, Tenant is responsible for
all upkeep on the Property and is solely responsible for glass breakage,
regardless of cause. Tenant must provide all snow removal.</P>

condition and repair all heating, air conditioning, plumbing and electrical
services and equipment.</P>

any obligations on which Tenant remains in default for more than thirty (30)
days, and the amount so paid by the Landlord shall be payable to Landlord on
demand and shall bear interest from the date paid until reimbursed to the
Landlord at the rate of one percent (1%) per month. This is an optional remedy
with Landlord, and the election of such remedy by Landlord shall not constitute
a waiver by Landlord of Landlord's rights to proceed against Tenant for default
as elsewhere herein provided. In the event Landlord elects this remedy, the act
of default by Tenant shall be Tenant's failure to pay on demand.</P>
<P>&#9;2.05. <U>Assignment and Subletting</U>. Tenant may sublet all or any part
of the Property for any legal use as permitted in this Lease, with the prior
written consent of Landlord. Tenant must provide written notice to Landlord of

occurs.</P>
<P>&#9;2.06. <U>Regulations</U>. Tenant covenants and agrees to make no unlawful
use of the Property and to comply with all of the statutes, ordinances, rules,
orders, regulations and requirements of federal, state and municipal or other
governmental authorities, and to acquire, at its own expense, all necessary
licenses and permits in connection with the Property and Tenant's business
activities thereon.&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;2.07. <U>Insurance and Indemnity</U>.</P>
<P>&#9;a. Landlord shall not at any time or to any extent whatsoever be liable,
responsible, or in any way accountable for any loss, injury, death, or damage to
persons or property, from any cause or causes whatsoever except for Landlord's
or Landlord's agent's negligence, which at any time may be suffered or sustained
by Tenant or by any person whosoever at any time using, occupying or visiting
the Property or be in, on or about the same or the sidewalks and driveways
adjacent and Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from any and
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses whatsoever arising

<P>&#9;b. Tenant shall, at all times during the term of this Agreement, maintain
in full force and effect, and pay all premiums for, public liability insurance
with a reputable insurance company or companies acceptable to Landlord covering
Tenant's activities on the Property. The general liability limits of said policy
or policies shall not be less than $1,000,000.00 per person and per occurrence.
Said insurance shall name the Landlord as an additional insured. </P>
<P>&#9;c. All insurance policies of Tenant shall be issued by companies and in
forms satisfactory to Landlord and shall expressly provide that the insurance
company shall notify the Landlord in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to
any lapse or cancellation. Each such policy or a duplicate or appropriate
evidence shall be delivered to Landlord. Tenant agrees if Tenant does not
procure such insurance and keep the same in full force and effect, Landlord, at
its option and subject to its right of reimbursement, may take out the necessary
insurance and pay the premium. Tenant waives its right of subrogation against
Landlord for any reason whatsoever, and any insurance policies herein required
to be procured by Tenant shall contain an express waiver of any right of
subrogation by the insurer against Landlord. </P>
<P>&#9;d.&#9;Tenant shall be responsible to provide fire and casualty insurance
on Tenant's personal property.</P>
<P>&#9;e. Tenant shall procure insurance insuring the Landlord against loss or
damage to the Property, and improvements and fixtures belonging to Landlord by
reason of fire and other casualties (Broad Form) with a qualified insurance
company or companies qualified in an amount and of such coverage as are
satisfactory to and approved by Landlord. The proceeds of such insurance in case
of loss or damage shall be paid to Landlord to be applied on account of the
obligation of Landlord to repair and/or rebuild the building pursuant to Article
5.03. Any proceeds not required for such purpose shall be the sole property of
Landlord.</P>
<U><P>&#9;</U>2.08. <U>Subordination</U>. Upon request of Landlord, Tenant will
subordinate its rights to the lien of any mortgage or mortgages, or lien or
other security interest resulting from any other method of financing or
refinancing, now or hereafter in force against the land and/or building. The
provisions of this paragraph notwithstanding, so long as Tenant is not in
default, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect for the full term and

normal business operations, then the Lease term hereby granted shall cease on
the day prior to the vesting of title in such authority and lease payments
hereunder shall be paid and adjusted as of that date; any prepaid rental shall
be prorated as of the date of such termination and returned to Tenant.</P>
<P>&#9;3.02. <U>Partial Taking</U>. If a portion of the Property shall be taken
and, as a result thereof, there shall be such a major change in the character of

manner as theretofore used, then and in that event Tenant, within fifteen (15)
days after the date of such vesting of title, may either cancel and terminate
this Agreement as of the date when that part of the Property so taken shall be
required for such public purpose, or said Tenant may continue to occupy the
remaining portion. In the event Tenant shall remain in possession and occupancy
of the remaining portion of the Property, all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such remaining
portion, except that the lease payments reserved to be paid hereunder shall be
equitably adjusted according to the amount and value of such remaining space;
and provided, further, that Landlord shall, at Landlord's own expense, promptly
and with all reasonable diligence, do such work as to make the remainder of the
Property usable by Tenant and this Agreement shall continue for the balance of
its term, subject to the terms and conditions herein stated. </P>
<P>&#9;3.03. <U>Condemnation Award</U>. The entire award of damages or
compensation for the Property taken via eminent domain, or the amount paid
pursuant to private purchase in lieu thereof, whether such condemnation or sale
be total or partial, shall belong to Landlord, except that damages awarded for
any loss of Tenant's shall belong to Tenant. Tenant may interpose and prosecute,
in any condemnation proceeding, a claim for the value of any trade fixtures
installed in the Property by Tenant, and in the case of a partial condemnation
of the Property, the cost, loss or damages sustained by Tenant as the result of
the alterations, modifications or repairs which may reasonably be required by
Tenant in order to place the remaining portion of the Property, not so
condemned, in a suitable condition for Tenant's further occupancy. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IV - EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES</P>
<P>&#9;4.01. <U>Default by Tenant</U>. Upon the occurrence of any of the

proceedings or have taken against such party in any court pursuant to state or
federal statute, a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, reorganization, or

<P>&#9;4.02.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Remedies on Default</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;a. If Tenant shall fail to cure any default under
paragraph 4.01 within the time provided therein, or if a receiver be appointed
for Tenant, or if Tenant for any reason be insolvent, or if a Tenant vacates or
abandons the leased property, then Landlord, besides other rights or remedies it
may have, shall have the immediate right of re-entry and may remove all persons
and property from the property without liability to any person for damages
sustained by reason of such removal. Such property may be removed and stored in
a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of
Tenant;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;b. Should Landlord elect to re-enter as herein provided,
or should it take possession pursuant to legal proceedings or pursuant to any
notice provided for by law, it may either terminate this Lease to the same
extent and with all the legal incidents as if the term had expired by efflux of
time, or it may from time to time relet the property for such term or terms
(which may be for a term extending beyond the term of this Lease) and at such
rental and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord, in its sole
discretion, may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs
to said Property; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;c. Upon such re-letting (1) Tenant shall be immediately
liable to pay to Landlord, in addition to any rent or other sums then due and
unpaid hereunder, the cost of expense of such re-letting and of such reasonable
alterations and repairs incurred by Landlord and the amount, if any, by which
the rent reserved in this Lease for the period of such re-letting (up to but not
beyond the term of this Lease) exceeds the sum agreed to be paid as rent for the
property for such period on such reletting; or (2) at the option of Landlord,
rents received by Landlord from such re-letting shall be applied first to the
payment of any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to
Landlord; second to the payment of any costs and expenses of such re-letting and
of such alterations and repairs; third to the payment of rent due and unpaid
hereunder; and the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in
payment of future rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. If
Tenant has been credited with any rent to be received by such re-letting under
option (1) and such rent shall not be promptly paid to Landlord by the new
Tenant, during any month be less than that to be paid during that month by
Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to Landlord. Such
deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly, or at Landlord's option the
deficiency amount may be accelerated to the end of the lease term and declared
immediately due and payable;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;d. No such re-entry or taking possession of the property
by Landlord shall be construed as an election on its part to terminate this
Lease unless a written notice of such intention be given to Tenant or unless the
termination be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any
such re-letting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect
to terminate this Lease for such previous breach;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;e. Should Landlord at any time terminate this Lease for
any breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have, it may recover from
Tenant all damages it may incur by reason of such breach, including the cost of
recovering the property and including the worth at the time of such termination
of the excess, if any, of the amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent
reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the stated term of the then
reasonable rental value of the property for the remainder of the stated term,
all of which amounts shall be immediately due and payable from Tenant to
Landlord;</P>
