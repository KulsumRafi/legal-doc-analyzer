"Net after-tax benefit" shall mean the sum of (1) all payments and benefits which Employee receives or is then entitled to receive from the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, less (2) the amount of federal income taxes payable with respect to the payments and benefits described in (1) above calculated at the maximum marginal income tax rate for each year in which such payments and benefits shall be paid to Employee (based upon the rate in effect for such year as set forth in the Code at the time of the first payment of the foregoing), less (3) the amount of excise taxes imposed with respect to the payments and benefits described in (1) above by Section 4999 of the Code.<BR>

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey (regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable New Jersey principles of conflicts of law).</P>
<P>9.6&#9;<U>Contract Right of Participants.</U>  <BR>
