      This Agreement amends (a) the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement between
the parties dated as of December 28, 2001, (the "Loan Agreement"); and (b) the
promissory note executed by Borrower dated December 28, 2001, in the original
principal amount of $27,500,000 ("Note").

      For valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:

of the Loan Agreement is deleted and replaced with the following:

            "Revolving Loan Termination Date" means March 31, 2004.

            1.2 Section 3.3.3 of the Loan Agreement is deleted and replaced with
the following:

            3.3.3 PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. The principal balance of the Revolving
