<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>ELECTION OF DIRECTORS</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The articles of the Corporation provide that each shareholder entitled to vote
in the election of directors has the right to cast a number of votes equal to
the number of votes attached to the shares held by the shareholder multiplied
by the number of directors to be elected. The shareholder may cast all such
votes in favour of one candidate or distribute such votes among the candidates
in any manner the shareholder sees fit. Where the shareholder has voted for
more than one candidate without specifying the distribution of the
shareholder&#146;s votes among such candidates, the shareholder will be deemed to
have distributed the shareholder&#146;s votes equally among the candidates for whom
the shareholder voted.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>On any ballot that may be called for in the election of directors, the
management representatives designated in the enclosed form of proxy intend to
cast the votes to which the shares represented by such proxy are entitled
equally among the proposed nominees whose names are set forth below, unless the
shareholder who has given such proxy has directed that the shares be otherwise
voted or withheld from voting in the election of directors. </B>If a shareholder
wishes to distribute the shareholder&#146;s votes other than equally among the
proposed nominees for whom the shareholder has directed the management
representatives designated in the enclosed form of proxy to vote, the
shareholder must do so personally at the meeting or by another proper form of
proxy. Management anticipates that all of the proposed nominees will be able to
serve as a director. If a proposed nominee is unable to serve as a director for
any reason prior to the meeting, the management representatives designated in
the enclosed form of proxy, unless directed to withhold from voting in the
election of directors, reserve the right to vote for other nominees at their
discretion.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets out the names of the persons proposed by
management to be nominated for election as directors to hold office until the
next annual meeting or until their successors are elected or appointed, all
major positions and offices in the Corporation or any of its significant
affiliates held by each nominee, the principal occupation or employment of each
nominee, the year in which each nominee was first elected a director of the
Corporation and the approximate number of shares of each class of shares of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries that each nominee has advised the Corporation,
are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or subject to control or
direction by that person at the date of this Circular.

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Directors who are resident in Canada receive their compensation in Canadian
dollars, while U.S. resident directors receive their compensation in U.S.
dollars. Directors who are not officers of the Corporation or its affiliates
(the &#147;outside directors&#148;) are entitled to receive an annual retainer of $20,000
and an attendance fee of $1,000 in respect of each meeting of the board of
directors which they are in attendance or $400 if attending by telephone (other
than any meeting held immediately following an annual meeting of shareholders).
In addition, such directors who are chairmen of board committees receive an
annual retainer of $2,000. Directors who are members of board committees receive an attendance
fee of $700 for each committee meeting attended ($400 if the meeting occurs on
the same day as a board meeting). In 2002, nine directors of the Corporation
received a total of $122,000. At the discretion of the board, outside directors
may also from time-to-time be granted options to acquire common shares of the
Corporation. During 2002, 24,000 options to acquire common shares of the
Corporation were issued to eight non-management directors at an exercise price
of US$17.71 (Cdn$28.30). Directors are also reimbursed for travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending board or committee meetings.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>REPORT OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the
Corporation (the &#147;Committee&#148;) was comprised of four directors at March&nbsp;3, 2003;
Messrs.&nbsp;J.L. Cockwell (Chair), L. Liebman, J.R. McCaig and S. Pollock. The
Committee meets as required, and at least annually, to monitor and review
management compensation policies and benefits, management succession planning
and to review the overall composition and quality of the Corporation&#146;s
management resources. The Committee met on two occasions in 2002. The Committee
has a specific mandate to review and approve executive compensation. This
includes an annual evaluation of the performance of the Corporation&#146;s President
and Chief Executive Officer and the four highest paid executive officers (the
&#147;Named Executive Officers&#148;), and a review of performance reports for other
executive officers of the Corporation. The Committee makes recommendations to
the board of directors with respect to the compensation of the executive
officers, and the board gives final approval on compensation matters.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive compensation is based on the relative role and responsibility of
the executive as compared to other executives within the Corporation and the
market place, as well as on the executive&#146;s individual performance. This
applies equally to all executive officers, including the President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation. The compensation arrangements of the
Corporation are focused on rewarding performance, taking into account length of
service, level of responsibility and experience of the individual. A specific
objective of the Corporation is to attract and retain highly qualified and
motivated individuals. Accordingly, compensation levels are monitored to ensure
that they are competitive within the relevant market place.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key components of executive officers&#146; compensation are base salary,
short-term incentives and long-term incentives. The short and long-term
incentive plans are designed to provide a significant amount of variable
compensation which is linked to individual performance and increases in
shareholder value.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Base salaries </I>of executives are reviewed annually and are based on
individual performance, responsibility and experience to ensure that they
reflect the contribution of each executive. The Corporation believes that base
salaries for senior executives should be lower than average for the industry
with compensation weighted to share performance in order to align these
executives&#146; interests with shareholders.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Short-term incentives </I>are represented by cash bonus awards. Awards are
determined based on both the performance of the Corporation and the individual
executive. The performance of the Corporation is measured by the achievement of
financial and other objectives of the Corporation, also taking into
consideration the performance of industry competitors and macro-economic
factors, as well as the efforts and achievements of the executive team. The
performance of the individual executive is based on the degree to which that
executive has met specific agreed upon objectives.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Long-term incentives </I>are intended to reward management based on increases
in the value of the Corporation&#146;s common shares. The purpose of these
arrangements is to achieve a commonality of interest between shareholders and
management and to motivate executives to improve the Corporation&#146;s financial
success, measured in terms of enhanced shareholder wealth over the longer term.

options to executives to purchase common shares at a fixed price, being the

year is determined based on a multiple of the executive&#146;s base salary for that
year. The options vest as to 20% at the end of each year on a cumulative basis
and are exercisable over a 10-year period. Commencing in February 2003, in
order to minimize any appearance of executives opportunistically exercising
options for personal gains, the Corporation&#146;s board of directors adopted a
policy requiring the Named Executive Officers to hold, for at least one year,
common shares or deferred units of the Corporation equal to the net after-tax
cash realized from the exercise of option grants, starting with options granted
in 2003;</FONT></TD>

Units based on a rate set at the discretion of the Corporation&#146;s board on the
award date. The portion of the annual bonus award elected to be received in
Units by the executive may, at the discretion of the board, be increased by a
factor of up to two times for purposes of calculating the number of Units to be
allocated under the DSUP. An executive who holds Units will receive additional

same basis as if the dividends were re-invested. The Units vest over a

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This compensation award reflects Mr.&nbsp;Clark&#146;s responsibilities,
effectiveness and achievement of corporate goals, including the following:
increasing funds from operations on a per share basis by 15% through business
growth and improvements, as well as cost reductions; increasing the
Corporation&#146;s operating capacities through various acquisitions, and other
asset management initiatives; and the distribution of the Corporation&#146;s home
building operations to shareholders, delivering to shareholders a special
dividend of approximately $2.00 per share, all of which resulted in a total
return for shareholders of 20% during the year, when both dividends and share
price appreciation are considered.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brookfield considers that six of the 12 nominees for the board of
directors, are unrelated directors within the meaning of Guidelines; that is,
free from any interest, business or other relationships (other than interests
and relationships arising from shareholdings), which could, or could be
reasonably perceived to, materially interfere with a director&#146;s ability to act
in the best interests of the Corporation and all its shareholders. In making
this determination, the circumstances of each director have been examined in
relation to a number of factors, including whether or not they are members of
management of the Corporation or an officer of an affiliate. The Corporation
considers this to be an appropriate size and composition, given the diversity
of the Corporation&#146;s operations and the need for a variety of experience and
backgrounds to ensure an effective and efficient board. Four members of the
board of directors, Messrs.&nbsp;G.E. Arnell, Chairman, J.E. Zuccotti, Co-Chairman,
R.B. Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer and D.D. Arthur, President
and Chief Executive Officer, Canadian Commercial Operations, are executive
officers of the Corporation.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of directors of Brookfield has three committees: the Audit
Committee, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, and the Governance
and Nominating Committee. Special committees may be formed from time to time as
required to review particular matters or transactions. While the board of
directors retains overall responsibility for corporate governance matters, the
Audit, Human Resources and Compensation, and Governance and Nominating
Committees have specific responsibilities for certain aspects of corporate
governance as described below.

whom are independent and unrelated directors: Messrs.&nbsp;A.S. Olson (Chairman),
W.T. Cahill, P.D. McFarlane and S. Pollock. In addition to being unrelated and
independent directors as described above, all members of the Corporation&#146;s
Audit Committee must meet an additional &#147;independence&#148; test under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in that their director&#146;s fees are the only compensation
they, or their firms, receive from the Corporation.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the Corporation&#146;s
systems and procedures for financial reporting and internal control, reviewing
certain public disclosure documents and monitoring the performance of the
Corporation&#146;s external auditors. The committee is also responsible for
reviewing the Corporation&#146;s annual audited financial statements and
management&#146;s financial analysis and review of operations prior to their
approval by the full board of directors. The Audit Committee met twice in 2002,
including meeting with the Corporation&#146;s external auditors independent of
management on both occasions. There are four Audit Committee meetings scheduled
for 2003. Meeting frequency and agendas may change from time to time depending
on opportunities or risks faced by the Corporation.

committee are also independent. The committee is responsible for reviewing and
reporting to the board on human resource planning, including succession
planning and proposed senior management appointments, the levels and form of
executive compensation in general, and the specific compensation of senior
executives. The committee also reviews the job descriptions and annual
objectives of the Corporation&#146;s senior executives and the performance of these
executives in relation to these objectives, and reports to the board. The Human
Resources and Compensation Committee met twice in 2002. There are three Human
Resources and Compensation Committee meetings scheduled for 2003. Meeting
frequency and agendas may change from time to time depending on opportunities
or risks faced by the Corporation.

inadequate, the directors have the responsibility to bring about appropriate
change.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brookfield&#146;s governance practices are designed to encourage autonomy and
effective decision making on the part of management, while ensuring scrutiny by
the Corporation&#146;s shareholders through its board of directors and its
committees.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Management&#146;s Relationship to
the Board</I><BR><BR>Senior management of the Corporation reports to and is accountable to the board
of directors. At its meetings, the board regularly engages in a private session
with the Corporation&#146;s Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer
without other members of senior management present. The board also meets at
each meeting independently of any members of management.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Management Accountability</I><BR><BR>Business plans are developed to ensure the compatibility of shareholder, board
and management views on the Corporation&#146;s strategic direction, performance
targets and utilization of shareholders&#146; equity. A special meeting of
Brookfield&#146;s board is held each year to review the strategic initiatives and
the business plan submitted by senior management. The board&#146;s approval of the
annual business plan then provides a mandate for senior management to conduct
the affairs of the Corporation knowing it has the necessary board support.
Material deviations from the plan are reported to and considered by the board.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Board Information</I><BR><BR>Information provided by management to directors is critical to their
effectiveness. In addition to the reports presented to the board at its regular
and special meetings, the board is also kept informed on a timely basis by
management of corporate developments and key decisions taken by management in
pursuing the Corporation&#146;s business plan. New directors are provided with
comprehensive information about the Corporation and its operations. The
directors periodically assess the quality, completeness and timeliness of
information provided by management to the board.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Management Rewards</I><BR><BR>Brookfield&#146;s compensation plans are based on maintaining a direct link between
management rewards and the wealth created for shareholders. The Corporation
attempts to reward the most senior executives with primarily compensation
earned through share appreciation. Annually, senior executives receive
allocations of share purchase options to augment their compensation, and in
1999 a deferred share unit plan was introduced for the most senior executives
in order to encourage further share ownership. Brookfield is also committed to
maintaining periodic reviews of its compensation practices to ensure that
management is fairly rewarded over time based on performance.

stock options has become the primary vehicle for focusing management on
achieving long-term results. Unfortunately, stock option grants can and do
often provide levels of compensation well beyond those merited. It has
become abundantly clear that stock option grants in which the exercise price
is not indexed to peer group performance often reward executives for stock
price increases due solely to a general stock market rise, rather than to
extraordinary company performance.</FONT></TD>

reward participating executives for outperforming the competition. Indexed
options would have value when our Corporation&#146;s stock price rises in excess
of its peer group average or declines less than its peer group average stock

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Brookfield&#146;s board of directors and Human Resources and Compensation Committee
strongly support the use of performance-based compensation arrangements as an
important component of executive compensation. However, for the reasons
described below, the board believes that adopting a policy of linking all
future executive stock options to an industry peer group stock performance
index is not the most effective performance-based compensation arrangement, and
therefore would not be in the best interests of Brookfield&#146;s shareholders. The
board therefore recommends that you vote &#147;AGAINST&#148; the proposal.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alignment of the interests of management with those of shareholders is
an important objective of Brookfield&#146;s compensation policies. As such, the
board of Brookfield has implemented both a Management Share Option Plan
(&#147;MSOP&#148;) and a Deferred Share Unit Plan (&#147;DSUP&#148;). These Plans reward management
only to the extent that the share price of Brookfield increases, as described
on page 5 of this Circular. The MSOP has been amended in 2003 to require that
the senior officers of the Corporation, upon exercising of options
awarded commencing in 2003, hold for at least one year following
exercise, common shares or
deferred units received on exercise equal in value to the net after-tax cash
realized from the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">exercise of option grants.
Furthermore, option proceeds may only be recognized through sale of the shares
in the open market, as opposed to the receipt of cash payment from the
Corporation. The objective of this requirement is to ensure that executives
sell any shares in the same market as other shareholders and to eliminate the
perception that executives have exercised options on an opportunistic basis. In
the case of the DSUP, management forgoes short-term cash awards in favor of
increasing their participation in the share price appreciation or deterioration
of Brookfield, and any gains realized under the DSUP are deferred until the
participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation. Accordingly, the board
believes that the current share ownership incentive plans are appropriately
designed to act in the best interests of shareholders.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the board believes that the Human Resources and Compensation
Committee should have the ability to establish compensation policies in light
of the competitive environment of which Brookfield must compete for executive
talent. Brookfield&#146;s current stock-based compensation plans are the type used
by the vast majority of corporations. The board believes that limiting the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee&#146;s ability to design a compensation
system in line with that of other companies could place Brookfield at a
competitive disadvantage in recruiting executives.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of these reasons, the board recommends that you vote against
adopting a policy of limiting future stock option grants to price-indexed
options.
