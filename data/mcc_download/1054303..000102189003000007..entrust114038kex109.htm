<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is made as of

Entrust Financial Services, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the
&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), and BBSB, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company
(the &#147;<U>Investor</U>&#148;). The Company and the Investor are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a &#147;<U>Party</U>&#148; and collectively
as the &#147;<U>Parties</U>.&#148;</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

&#147;<U>Register</U>,&#148; &#147;<U>Registered</U>,&#148; and
&#147;<U>Registration</U>&#148; refer to a registration effected by preparing

Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or successor statute (the
&#147;<U>Securities Act</U>&#148;), and the declaration or ordering of
effectiveness of such registration statement or document.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5
&#147;<U>Registrable Securities</U>&#148; means (i) any shares of Common
Stock of the Company that the Holder has acquired pursuant to the Limited
Personal Guaranty and Pledge Agreement between the Company and David Hite
(collectively, the &#147;<U>Loan Documents</U>&#148;), including by exercise of
the warrants or options pledged under the Loan Documents, (ii) any shares of
Common Stock issuable to the Holder upon conversion of the $2,000,000
Convertible Promissory Note dated December 30, 2002 from the Company in favor of
the Investor, and (iii) any Common Stock issued or issuable with respect to the
Common Stock referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) by way of a dividend, split, or
in connection with a combination of securities, recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or other reorganization; provided however, that with respect to
any Registrable Securities, such securities shall cease to be Registrable
Securities when (x) a registration statement registering such securities under
the Securities Act has been declared effective and such securities have been
sold or otherwise transferred by the holder thereof pursuant to such effective
registration statement, (y) such securities are sold in compliance with
paragraph (d) of Rule 145 or (z) such securities are sold to the public in
accordance with Rule 144. For purposes of this Agreement, a person shall be

restrictions or limitations upon the exercise of such right), whether or not
such acquisition has actually been effected.</FONT> </P>

Registration Rights</U>.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1
<U>Demand Registrations</U>. At any time following the date on
which the Investor takes possession of any Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Loan Documents, one or more Holders may request registration under the
Securities Act of such Registrable Securities on Form&nbsp;S-1 or any similar
long-form registration (&#147;<U>Long-Form Registrations</U>&#148;) or on Form
S-3 or any similar short-form registration, if available (&#147;<U>Short-Form
</U>Registrations&#148;). Within ten days after receipt of any such request, the
Company will give written notice of such requested registration to all other
Holders, if any, and will include in such registration all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for
inclusion therein within 20 days after the receipt of the Company&#146;s notice.
Only two registrations may be demanded pursuant to this section (each, a
&#147;<U>Demand Registration</U>&#148;), and only one of which may be a
Long-Form Registration. A registration shall not be treated as a Demand
Registration unless the holders of Registrable Securities are able to include,
in accordance with the following provisions, at least 75% of the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration and until (i) the
applicable registration statement under the Securities Act (the
&#147;<U>Registration Statement</U>&#148;) has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the <U>&#147;SEC</U>&#148;) with respect to such Demand
Registration and been declared effective and (ii) such Registration Statement
shall have been maintained continuously effective for a period of at least 120
days or such shorter period when all Registrable Securities included therein
have been sold thereunder in accordance with the manner of distribution set
forth in such registration statement. The Company may postpone for up to six
months the filing or the effectiveness (which may include the withdrawal of an
effective registration statement) of a Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 2.1 if the Company&#146;s board of directors reasonably determines in
its good faith judgment that, because of the existence of any proposal or plan
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to engage in any acquisition or
financing activity (other than in the ordinary course of business) or the
unavailability for reasons beyond the Company&#146;s control of any required
financial statements, or any other event or condition of similar significance to
the Company, it would be materially disadvantageous to the Company for such a
Registration Statement to be maintained effective, or to be filed and become
effective. The Company may include in a Demand Registration any securities that
are not Registrable Securities. If the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities sought to be registered in a Demand Registration request that such
Demand Registration be an underwritten offering, then the Company shall use its
best efforts to acquire a nationally recognized underwriter or underwriters to
manage and administer such offering, such underwriter or underwriters, as the
case may be, to be subject to the reasonable approval of holders of a majority
of the Registrable Securities. If a Demand Registration is an underwritten
offering and the managing underwriter determines and advises in writing that the
inclusion of all the Registrable Securities and other securities proposed to be
included in the underwritten public offering would interfere with the successful
marketing of such Registrable Securities, then the number of such Registrable
Securities that the managing underwriter believes in good faith may be sold in
such underwritten public offering shall be allocated for inclusion in the
Registration Statement in the following order of priority: (x) Registrable
Securities being offered by the Holders, on a <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> basis,
based upon the number of Registrable Securities sought to be registered by each
such Holder; and (y) other securities sought to be included in the Demand
Registration.</FONT> </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>General</U>. In the event that the Company proposes to
register any of its securities under the Securities Act, whether on its own
behalf or at the request of any Holder of such securities entitled to so
request, on any form (other than Form S-4 or Form S-8) that would legally permit
the inclusion of Registrable Securities, the Company shall give the Holders
written notice thereof as soon as practicable but in no event less than 30 days
prior to the filing of such registration, and shall provide the Holders an
opportunity to include in such registration all Registrable Securities requested
by the Holders in writing to be included therein, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 2.2. If a Holder chooses to include in any such
registration statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities it holds,
such Holder shall, within ten days after the above-described notice from the
Company so notify the Company in writing. Such notice shall state the intended
method of disposition of the Registrable Securities by such Holder. If a Holder
decides not to include all of its Registrable Securities in any registration
statement thereafter filed by the Company, such Holder shall nevertheless
continue to have the right to include any Registrable Securities in any
subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by
the Company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Underwriting</U>. If the registration statement under which
the Company gives notice under this Section 2.2 is for an underwritten offering,
the Company shall so advise the Holders of Registrable Securities. In such
event, the right of any such Holder to be included in a registration pursuant to
this Section 2.2 shall be conditioned upon such Holder&#146;s participation in
such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder&#146;s Registrable Securities
in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to
distribute Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Company and its underwriters reserve the right
to reduce the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting based
upon a good faith determination that marketing factors require a limitation of
the number of shares to be underwritten. Upon such a determination, the Company
shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that would otherwise be
registered and underwritten pursuant to this Agreement and the Company shall
allocated the number of shares of Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the registration in the following order of priority: (i) Registrable
Securities being offered by the Holders, on a <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> basis,
based upon the number of Registrable Securities sought to be registered by each
such Holder; and (ii) other securities sought to be included in the Demand
Registration. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting,
such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and
the underwriter, delivered at least ten business days prior to the effective
date of the registration statement.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3
<U>Costs of Registration</U>. The Company shall bear the costs
of each registration in which any Holder participates pursuant to Sections 2.1
and 2.2, but excluding any underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of
Registrable Securities.</FONT> </P>

<U>Transferability of Registration Rights</U>. The rights to
cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2
may be transferred by a Holder to a transferee that holds Registrable
Securities; <U>provided</U> <U>however</U>, that such transferee shall agree to
be subject to all restrictions set forth in this Agreement.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5
<U>Reports under Securities Exchange Act of 1934</U>. With a
view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule&nbsp;144
promulgated under the Securities Act and any other rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit the Holders to sell securities of the Company to the
public pursuant to a registration on Form&nbsp;S-3 or without registration, the
Company agrees to:</FONT> </P>

any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i)&nbsp;a written statement
by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC
Rule&nbsp;144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, or that it qualifies as
a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form&nbsp;S-3 (or any
successor form that provides for short-form registration) (at any time after it
so qualifies), and such other information as may be reasonably requested in
availing the Investor of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the
selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form.</FONT> </P>

Statement until the termination of said period.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2

Company has sought confidential treatment), and (ii) such number of copies of a

laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as each Holder who holds (or has
the right to hold) Registrable Securities being offered reasonably requests, (b)
prepare and file in those jurisdictions such amendments (including

(iii) file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction,

As soon as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the Company

order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement and, if
such an order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest
practicable time and to notify each Holder who holds Registrable Securities
being sold (and, in the event of an underwritten offering, the managing

Such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself,
the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of disposition of
the Registrable Securities held by it as shall be reasonably required to effect

Each Holder agrees to notify the Company promptly, but in any event within
five business days after the date on which all Registrable Securities covered by

the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.5, such Holder
will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Holder&#146;s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 3.5 and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder
shall deliver to the Company (at the expense of the Company) or destroy (and

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement
under this Agreement:</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1
The Company agrees to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, directors, employees,
trustees, beneficiaries, partners, attorneys and agents and each Person who
controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) such holder or such an other
indemnified Person against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in
any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or a fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by and
contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such holder
expressly for use therein. In connection with an underwritten offering and
without limiting any of the Company&#146;s other obligations under this
Agreement, the Company shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers,
directors, employees and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) such underwriters or such other indemnified Person to the
same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders
of Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6.1, as it
pertains to any preliminary or final prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit
of any indemnified Person if the untrue statement or omission of material fact
contained in the preliminary or final prospectus was corrected on a timely basis
in the prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, if such corrected prospectus
was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, and the
indemnified Person was promptly advised in writing not to use the incorrect
prospectus prior to the use giving rise to a violation and such indemnified
Person, notwithstanding such advice, used such incorrect prospectus.</FONT> </P>

In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder is
participating, each such Holder will furnish to the Company in writing
information regarding such Holder&#146;s ownership of Registrable Securities and
its intended method of distribution thereof and, to the extent permitted by law,
shall indemnify the Company, its directors, officers, employees and agents and
each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) the Company
or such other indemnified Person against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including with respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder asserted by any other indemnified Person) resulting
from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the
registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is
caused by and contained in such information so furnished in writing by such
Holder; provided that the obligation to indemnify will be several, not joint and
several, among Holders and the liability of each such Holder will be in
proportion to and limited to the net amount received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3
Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which its seeks
indemnification; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not
release the indemnifying party from its obligation under this Section 5, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such
failure to provide such notice.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4
In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified
party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent
that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified,
to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to
defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with
this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or
other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision
and monitoring (unless such indemnified party reasonably objects to such
assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are
different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying
party, in which event the indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the
indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining
separate legal counsel). An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any
settlement of an action or claim effected without its consent. The indemnifying
party shall lose its right to defend, contest, litigate and settle a matter if
it shall fail to diligently contest such matter (except to the extent settled in
accordance with the next following sentence). No matter shall be settled by an
indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).</FONT> </P>
