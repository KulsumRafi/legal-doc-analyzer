The decision of any Shareholder whether or not to participate in any additional
funding shall be in such Shareholder's sole discretion and the refusal of any

             ARTICLE 5 - RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF CAPITAL OF ZSG


5.1 NO DEALING WITH CAPITAL. Each of the Shareholders covenants that it will not
sell, assign, donate, encumber, transfer, pledge, charge, subject to a security
interest, or otherwise dispose of or in any way whatsoever, deal with the
ownership of any Capital, securities convertible into Capital or Shareholder
Loans now or hereafter owned by it, except in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or with the prior written unanimous consent of the other Shareholders,
and in each case only as permitted under the Financing Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholders agree that none of
them shall transfer any Capital or Shareholder Loans to any third party (other
than to a Permitted Transferee or, as concerns Pulp Holding, as set forth under
Section 5.5 (a) hereof) until Acceptance of the Mill.

5.2 TRANSFER TO PERMITTED TRANSFEREE. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.1 hereof and any other provisions of this Agreement which restrict the
disposition of, or dealing with, Capital or Shareholder Loans, a Shareholder
shall at any time or from time to time have the right, subject to the provisions
of the Financing Documents, to dispose of all or any Capital or Shareholder
Loans held by such Shareholder to a Permitted Transferee, provided that at the
time of such disposition:

         (a)      such Permitted Transferee shall undertake VIS-A-VIS the other
                  parties hereto, in form satisfactory to such other parties,
                  acting reasonably, notwithstanding Section 5.3 hereof, to
                  assume and be bound by all of the terms and obligations of the
                  disposing Shareholder contained in this Agreement, the
                  Financing Documents and all other agreements between or among
                  the disposing Shareholder, on the one hand, and any of the
                  other parties hereto, on the other hand, in connection with
                  ZSG and the Project, except, in the case of RWE being the
                  Shareholder from whom such Capital or Shareholder Loans are
                  acquired, the EPC Contract and all agreements related thereto
                  which shall



                                       17
<Page>

                  continue to be binding obligations of RWE, in addition to the
                  Shareholder from whom such Capital or Shareholder Loans are
                  acquired (VERTRAGSBEITRITT, SCHULDBEITRITT);

         (b)      the disposing Shareholder and the Permitted Transferee agree
                  that the Permitted Transferee shall remain a Permitted
                  Transferee of the Shareholder from whom such Capital or
                  Shareholder Loans are acquired for so long as the Permitted
                  Transferee is an owner of any Capital or Shareholder Loans;
                  and

         (c)      the other parties hereto receive, in form and substance
                  satisfactory to them, acting reasonably, evidence that the
                  Permitted Transferee is a Permitted Transferee of the
                  Shareholder from whom Capital or Shareholder Loans are to be
                  acquired and that the agreements referred to in Sections
                  5.2(a) and (b) above, are legal, valid and binding obligations
                  of the Permitted Transferee and the disposing Shareholder, as
                  applicable.

5.3 CONTINUING LIABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding a disposition of
Capital or Shareholder Loans to a Permitted Transferee, a disposing Shareholder
shall VIS-A-VIS the other parties hereto remain jointly and severally liable
together with the Permitted Transferee as principal obligor under all its
obligations contained in this Agreement, the Financing Documents and all other
agreements between or among the disposing Shareholder, on the one hand, and any
of the other parties hereto, on the other hand, in connection with ZSG and the
Project, and the disposing Shareholder agrees to unconditionally guarantee to
the other parties hereto the due performance by the Permitted Transferee of all
obligations imposed on such Permitted Transferee under this Agreement, the
Financing Documents and such other agreements.

5.4 TRANSFER OF CAPITAL TO PERMITTED TRANSFEREE. If Capital or Shareholder Loans
are transferred by a Shareholder to one or more Permitted Transferee(s), such
Permitted Transferee(s), together with the Shareholder should such Shareholder
retain any Capital or Shareholder Loans, shall be entitled to exercise all
rights of such Shareholder and such Permitted Transferee hereunder, the articles
of association of ZSG, the Financing Documents and under all other agreements
between or among the disposing Shareholder, on the one hand, and any of the
other parties hereto, on the other hand, in connection with ZSG and the Project
only acting jointly and unanimously.

5.5      TRANSFER OF PULP HOLDING SHARES AND RWE SHARES.

         (a)      TRANSFER OF PULP HOLDING SHARES. Notwithstanding the provision
                  in Section 5.1 hereof and any other provisions of this
                  Agreement which restrict the disposition of, or dealing with,
                  Capital, Pulp Holding shall at any time or from time to time
                  have the right, subject to the provisions of the Financing
                  Documents, to dispose of any Capital together with or without
                  any Shareholder Loans held by it representing up to 12.58% of
                  the entire Capital of ZSG or a percentage of the Shareholder
                  Loans extended by Pulp Holding to ZSG representing up to
                  12.58% of all Shareholder Loans, as the case may be, provided
                  that at the time of such disposition the acquiror of such
                  Capital shall undertake VIS-A-VIS the other parties hereto, in
                  form satisfactory to such other parties, acting reasonably, to
                  be bound by this Agreement and the Financing Documents
                  (VERTRAGSBEITRITT).

         (b)      TRANSFER OF RWE SHARES. Notwithstanding the provision in
                  Section 5.1 hereof and any other provisions of this Agreement
                  which restrict the disposition of, or dealing with, Capital,
                  RWE shall at any time or from time to time have the right,
                  subject to the provisions of the Financing Documents, to
                  dispose of any Capital together with or without any
                  Shareholder Loans held by it representing up to 4.31% of the
                  entire Capital of ZSG or a percentage of the Shareholder Loans
                  extended by RWE to ZSG representing up to 4.31% of all
                  Shareholder Loans, as the case may be, provided that at the
                  time of such disposition the acquiror of such Capital shall
                  undertake VIS-A-VIS the other parties hereto, in form
                  satisfactory to such other parties, acting reasonably, to be
                  bound by this Agreement and the Financing Documents
                  (VERTRAGSBEITRITT).

5.6 APPROVAL, INAPPLICABILITY OF PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS. If a transfer of Capital
and Shareholder Loans is permitted pursuant to this Article 5, all
Shareholders, in application of Section 4.1 of the articles of association of
ZSG, hereby consent to and approve such transfer. Further, as a result of
such consent and approval and the second sentence of Section 4.2 of ZSG's
articles of association, neither Article 6 hereof nor any preemptive right
(VORKAUFSRECHT) provided under ZSG's articles of association shall apply in
the case of a sale and transfer pursuant to Sections 5.2 and 5.5 hereof.

                                       19
<Page>


                          ARTICLE 6 - PREEMPTIVE RIGHT


6.1 NOTICE OF PROPOSED SALE. If any Shareholder (in this Article 6 referred to
as the "OFFEROR") receives a BONA FIDE written offer (in this Article 6 referred
to as the "OFFER") from any person, firm or corporation (other than in the case
of Sections 5.2 and 5.5) dealing at arm's length with the Offeror to purchase
all or any part of the Capital together with or without all or part of any
Shareholder Loans owned by the Offeror, which is acceptable to the Offeror, the
Offeror shall give notice of such Offer (in this Article 6 and the subsequent
Article 7 referred to as the "NOTICE") to the other Shareholders, shall set out
in the Notice the amount of Capital and Shareholder Loans to be sold pursuant to
the Offer (in this Article 6 and the subsequent Article 7 referred to as the
"OFFERED CAPITAL") and the terms upon which and the price at which (in this
Article 6 and the subsequent Article 7 referred to as the "PURCHASE PRICE") such
Offered Capital would be sold pursuant to the Offer. This Article 6 and the
subsequent Article 7 shall, however, only apply to Offers that provide for cash
consideration and for no other consideration than cash.

6.2 RIGHT TO PURCHASE OFFERED CAPITAL. Subject to the provisions of the
Financing Documents, upon the Notice being given, the other Shareholders (in
this Article 6 and the subsequent Article 7 sometimes collectively referred to
as the "OFFEREES" and sometimes individually referred to as an "OFFEREE") shall
have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Offered Capital
for the Purchase Price. The Offerees shall be entitled to purchase the Offered
Capital PRO RATA based upon the amount of the Capital owned by each Offeree (not
taking into account the Offered Capital) or in such other proportion as the
Offerees may agree in writing. ZSG shall in such a case give all necessary
consents and take all action necessary so as to implement the above. For the
purposes of this Section 6.2, any ancillary obligations offered by the third
party in the Offer in connection with the purchase of the Offered Capital shall
not be taken into consideration and the Offerees shall not be obligated to
compensate or perform such ancillary obligations. If the Offer includes the sale
of other objects in addition to the Offered Capital, the Offerees shall not be
obligated to purchase such other objects.

6.3 NOTICE OF PURCHASE AND ADDITIONAL PURCHASES. Within ten Business Days of
having been given the Notice, each Offeree desiring to purchase all of the
Offered Capital that he is entitled to purchase in accordance with the
provisions of Section 6.2 hereof shall give notice thereof to the Offeror and to
the other Offerees. If any Offeree does not give such notice, the



                                       20
<Page>

Offered Capital that it had been entitled to purchase (in this Section 6.3
referred to as the "REJECTED CAPITAL") may instead be purchased by the Offerees
who did give such notice, PRO RATA based upon the amount of the Capital owned by
such Offerees as between themselves or in such other proportion as such Offerees
may agree in writing, and, within five Business Days of the expiry of the ten
Business Day period specified in this Section 6.3, each Offeree who desires to
purchase all of the Rejected Capital that he is entitled to purchase in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall give an additional
notice thereof to the Offeror and to the other Offerees. If any Offeree entitled
to give such additional notice does not do so, the Rejected Capital that he had
been entitled to purchase may instead be purchased by the Offerees who did give
such notice, and so on from time to time until the Offerees are willing to
purchase all of the Offered Capital or until they are not willing to purchase
any more. If the Offerees are willing to purchase all, but not less than all, of
the Offered Capital, the transaction of purchase and sale shall be completed in
accordance with the terms set out in the Notice, subject to the provisions of
the Financing Documents.

6.4 SALE TO THIRD PARTY. If the Offerees do not give notice in accordance with
the provisions of Section 6.3 hereof that they are willing to purchase all of
the Offered Capital, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, the rights of
the Offerees to purchase the Offered Capital shall forthwith cease and terminate
and, as an exception to Section 5.1 hereof and subject to the provisions of the
Financing Documents, the Offeror may sell the Offered Capital to the third party
purchaser within sixty Business Days after the expiry of the ten Business Day
period or five Business Day periods, as the case may be, specified in Section
6.3 hereof, for a price not less than the Purchase Price and on other terms no
more favorable to such person than those set forth in the Notice, provided that
the person to whom the Offered Capital is to be sold and transferred agrees
vis-a-vis the other Shareholders prior to such transaction to be bound by this
Agreement, the Financing Documents (to the extent the Offeror was bound by such
agreements) and all other agreements between or among the Offeror, on the one
hand, and any of the other parties hereto, on the other hand, in connection with
ZSG and the Project, except, in the case of RWE being the Offeror, the EPC
Contract and all agreements related thereto which shall continue to be binding
obligations of RWE, and to become a party hereto, the Financing Documents and
such other agreements in place and stead of the Offeror who shall simultaneously
with the sale and transfer of the Offered Capital assign all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the Financing Documents and such other
agreements to such third party (VERTRAGSUBERNAHME, BEFREIENDE



                                       21
<Page>

SCHULDUBERNAHME), notwithstanding any obligations of the Offeror hereunder or
thereunder which by their terms shall survive the Offeror ceasing to be a
Shareholder of ZSG. If a Shareholder is entitled to sell and transfer the
Offered Capital to a third party purchaser pursuant to this Article 6, all
Shareholders, in application of ss. 4.1 of the articles of association of ZSG,
hereby consent to and approve such sale and transfer and the assignment of
rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Financing Documents and such
other agreements, provided, however, that if the Offered Capital is not sold
within the sixty Business Day period as permitted under this Article 6, the
right of the Offeror to sell, transfer and assign the Offered Capital to a third
party ceases and terminates, and any approval requirement contained in ZSG's
articles of association or otherwise, shall again take effect.



                           ARTICLE 7 - PIGGYBACK RIGHT


7.1 PIGGYBACK RIGHTS. In the event that Pulp Holding proposes to sell the
Offered Capital to a third party pursuant to Section 6.4 after the other parties
have not exercised their rights to purchase the Offered Capital, Pulp Holding
shall, within 30 Business Days following the expiry of the ten and five Business
Day Periods referred to in Section 6.3 hereof, give written notice (the
"PIGGYBACK NOTICE") to Fahr of its intention to sell and transfer the Offered
Capital pursuant to Section 6.4. Fahr may, not later than ten Business Days
after receipt of the Piggyback Notice, deliver to Pulp Holding a notice in
writing invoking the provisions of this Article 7 (a "PIGGYBACK DEMAND"). The
delivery by Fahr of a Piggyback Demand shall be irrevocable and shall bind Fahr
to sell all and transfer all, but not less than all, of the Capital and
Shareholder Loans (the "PIGGYBACK CAPITAL") owned by it, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 7, subject to the provisions of the Financing
Documents.

7.2 PIGGYBACK OFFER. If Fahr delivers a Piggyback Demand, then, before
completing any sale and transfer pursuant to Section 6.4, Pulp Holding shall
cause the third party to deliver to Fahr a notarized BONA FIDE offer (the
"PIGGYBACK OFFER") to purchase from Fahr the Piggyback Capital which Piggyback
Offer must be in compliance with the first sentence of Section 6.4. The
Piggyback Offer must be binding upon the third party and shall contain only such
terms and conditions as are identical to those upon which Pulp Holding proposes
to sell to the third party the Offered Capital pursuant to Section 6.4, provided
that the offer price for the Piggyback Capital, which shall be specified in the
Piggyback Offer, shall be an adequate consideration based on the consideration
for the Offered Capital which Pulp Holding



                                       22
<Page>

proposes to sell to the third party pursuant to Section 6.4. The closing date
and other closing arrangements for the purchase and sale transaction between
Fahr and the third party shall be specified in the Piggyback Offer and shall
be the same, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, as those specified between the third party and
Pulp Holding. The first sentence and the proviso contained in the last
sentence of Section 6.4 shall apply MUTATIS MUTANDIS to Fahr. If Fahr is
entitled to sell and transfer the Piggyback Capital to the third party
pursuant to this Article 7, all Shareholders, in application of ss. 4.1 of
the articles of association of ZSG, hereby consent and approve such sale and
transfer and the assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement,
the Financing Documents and such other agreements referred to in Section 6.4.
Further, as a result of such consent and approval and the second sentence of
Section 4.2 of ZSG's articles of association, neither Article 6 hereof nor
any preemptive right provided under ZSG's articles of association shall apply
in the case of a sale and transfer pursuant to this Article 7.

                          ARTICLE 8 - TRIGGERING EVENTS


8.1 TRIGGERING EVENTS DEFINED. A Triggering Event is the occurrence of any one
of the following events with respect to a Shareholder (the "DEFAULTING
SHAREHOLDER"):

         (a)      an Event of Default;

         (b)      an Act of Insolvency;

         (c)      any representation and warranty of the Shareholder contained
                  in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 hereof, or in any instrument or
                  document delivered pursuant to this Agreement at any time
                  hereafter, is or becomes not true and correct in any material
                  respect if the Shareholder has not taken all necessary steps,
                  to the satisfaction of the other Shareholders acting
                  reasonably, to ensure that the representation and warranty
                  becomes true and correct no later than thirty Business Days
                  after receipt by such Shareholder of notice from any other
                  Shareholders that the representation and warranty is not true
                  and correct;

         (d)      occurrence of a reason for redemption (EINZIEHUNG) or forced
                  transfer (ZWANGSUBERTRAGUNG) of the Capital of a Shareholder
                  pursuant to ss. 11.2 of ZSG's articles of association.



                                       23
<Page>

A Defaulting Shareholder shall without undue delay give notice to the other
parties that an event has occurred with respect to such Defaulting Shareholder
which constitutes a Triggering Event or which would, if such event is not
corrected or remedied or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the other
Shareholders as contemplated above, constitute such a Triggering Event.

8.2      OBLIGATION OF A DEFAULTING SHAREHOLDER FOLLOWING A TRIGGERING EVENT.

         (a)      Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Defaulting
                  Shareholder shall promptly make a binding offer to sell and
                  transfer all of its Capital and Shareholder Loans (including
                  all unpaid interest accrued thereon), if any, to the other
                  Shareholders (in such case, the "NON-DEFAULTING SHAREHOLDERS")
                  by notice to the Non-Defaulting Shareholders (the "SALE
                  NOTICE"). The offer shall be irrevocable and notarized. The
                  purchase price for such Capital shall be determined in
                  accordance with Section 8.6 hereof and the aggregate purchase
                  price for such Shareholder Loans shall be equal to the net
                  present value of 80% of the outstanding nominal amounts of
                  principal of such Shareholder Loans (the discount rate being
                  12%) plus the amount of all unpaid interest accrued on such
                  Shareholder Loans through the date of transfer. Subject to the
                  provisions of the Financing Documents, the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders shall have the right to purchase all, but not
                  less than all, of the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital and
                  Shareholder Loans, PRO RATA based upon the amount of Capital
                  owned by each Non-Defaulting Shareholder or in such other
                  proportion as the Non-Defaulting Shareholders may agree in
                  writing, and shall give written notice of their decision to
                  purchase to the Defaulting Shareholder within fifteen Business
                  Days after receipt of the Sale Notice (the "NOTICE PERIOD").
                  The completion of a purchase and sale of the Defaulting
                  Shareholder's Capital and Shareholder Loans under this Section
                  8.2 shall take place on the 15. Business Day after the expiry
                  of the Notice Period (provided all Non-Defaulting Shareholders
                  have timely given written notice pursuant to the preceding
                  sentence), provided further that if the purchase price of the
                  Capital has not been determined as per Section 8.6 hereof by
                  such day, the completion shall take place within ten Business
                  Days after the date on which the purchase price has been
                  conclusively determined pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof. All
                  Shareholders, in application of Section 4.1 of the articles of
                  association



                                       24
<Page>

                  of ZSG, hereby consent to and approve such sale and transfer
                  of Capital and Shareholder Loans pursuant to this Section
                  8.2(a). Further, as a result of such consent and approval and
                  the second sentence of Section 4.2 of the articles of
                  association of ZSG, neither Article 6 nor 7 hereof nor any
                  preemptive right (VORKAUFSRECHT) provided under the articles
                  of association of ZSG shall apply to such sale and transfer.
                  Notwithstanding any rights of the Non-Defaulting Shareholders
                  pursuant to Section 8.2(b) hereof, if no written notice is
                  given by all Non-Defaulting Shareholders within the Notice
                  Period, the Non-Defaulting Shareholders shall be deemed to
                  have rejected the offer made available to them to purchase the
                  Capital and Shareholder Loans of the Defaulting Shareholder.

         (b)      Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders may, subject to the provisions of
                  the Financing Documents, in their sole discretion, resolve to
                  either redeem (EINZIEHEN) the Capital of such Defaulting
                  Shareholder, or to transfer the Defaulting Shareholder's
                  Capital to one or more of the Non-Defaulting Shareholders or a
                  third party/third parties (including ZSG) designated by the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholder (a "FORCED TRANSFER"). The parties
                  hereto agree among each other that a Triggering Event shall
                  constitute a cause (WICHTIGER GRUND) within the meaning of
                  Section 11.2 (v) of ZSG's articles of association justifying
                  the exclusion of the Defaulting Shareholder and thus a
                  redemption or a Forced Transfer of the Capital of the
                  Defaulting Shareholder. Redemption or Forced Transfer shall be
                  effected against compensation for the Capital of the
                  Defaulting Shareholder in the amount equal to the Appraised
                  Value. Section 740 of the German Civil Code (BURGERLICHES
                  GESETZBUCH, the "BGB") is hereby excluded. In case of a
                  redemption or a Forced Transfer to ZSG following a
                  Triggering Event, the compensation of the purchase price shall
                  be payable in five equal annual installments, the first of
                  which shall be due and payable within ten days after the
                  Appraised Value has been conclusively determined pursuant to
                  Section 8.6 hereof unless payment of such compensation or such
                  purchase price would result in a violation of section 30 of
                  the German Law on Limited Liability Corporations (GESETZ
                  BETREFFEND DIE GESELLSCHAFTEN MIT BESCHRANKTER HAFTUNG, the
                  "GmbHG"), in which case payment shall only become due
                  and payable



                                       25

                  (without interest thereon) if and when it would not result in
                  such violation. The redemption of any Capital shall become
                  effective at the time of notice of the redemption to the
                  Defaulting Shareholder, and the Forced Transfer shall become
                  effective at the time of the later of notice of the Forced
                  Transfer to the Defaulting Shareholder and acceptance of the
                  Forced Transfer by the Non-Defaulting Shareholder(s) or the
                  third party/parties designated by the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders, in each case irrespective of the date of payment
                  of the compensation or the purchase price.

                  In case of a redemption or a Forced Transfer following a
                  Triggering Event, subject to the provisions of the Financing
                  Documents, the Defaulting Shareholder shall offer to the other
                  Shareholders and/or any third party/parties designated by the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders to which the Forced Transfer is to
                  be made to sell to them all of its Shareholder Loans
                  (including all unpaid interest accrued thereon), if any, for
                  an aggregate purchase price equal to the net present value of
                  80% of the outstanding nominal amounts of principal of such
                  Shareholder Loans (the discount rate being 12%) plus the
                  amount of all unpaid interest accrued on such Shareholder
                  Loans through the effective date of sale and transfer of the
                  Shareholder Loans. Such offer shall be made irrevocably by
                  notice of the Defaulting Shareholder within ten Business Days
                  of the date on which the Defaulting Shareholder has been
                  notified of the resolution of the other Shareholders providing
                  for the redemption or Forced Transfer. Any one of the other
                  Shareholders and/or any third party/parties designated by the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders to which the Forced Transfer is to
                  be made may give notice to the Defaulting Shareholder that
                  such other Shareholders and/or such third party/parties will
                  accept the offer, which notice shall be given within ten
                  Business Days of receipt of such offer from the Defaulting
                  Shareholder. If such notice is given by any one of the other
                  Shareholders and/or such third party/parties, the other
                  Shareholders and/or such third party/parties are obliged to
                  accept such offer and acquire all of the Defaulting
                  Shareholder's Shareholder Loans either PRO RATA based on the
                  share of Capital owned by each such other Shareholder (not
                  taking into account all of the Capital) and/or such third
                  party/parties (taking into account the transferred Capital),
                  or in such other proportion as the other Shareholders



                                       26
<Page>

                  and/or such third party/parties may agree in writing, or, if
                  not all of such other Shareholders and/or such third
                  party/parties wish to acquire a portion of such Shareholder
                  Loans, in application of the rules set forth in Section 6.3
                  sentences 1 through 3 hereof. If, after application of such
                  rules, not all of such Shareholder Loans are acquired by the
                  other Shareholders and/or such third party/parties, the other
                  Shareholder and/or such third party/parties who has first
                  given notice of accepting the offer shall be obliged to
                  acquire the final portion of such Shareholder Loans that has
                  not been acquired by the other Shareholders and/or such third
                  party/parties. For the event that none of the other
                  Shareholders and/or such third party/parties accept the offer
                  of the Defaulting Shareholder, the Defaulting Shareholder,
                  with effect as of the date of redemption or the Forced
                  Transfer, hereby forgives 20% of the nominal amounts of
                  principal of such Defaulting Shareholder's Shareholder Loans
                  and of all unpaid interest on such 20% outstanding on or
                  having accrued through such date, with the remaining balance
                  of such Defaulting Shareholder's Shareholder Loans to be due
                  and payable upon complete repayment of the Project Financing
                  (principal and interest) by ZSG, provided, however, that no
                  amounts shall be due and payable if and to the extent payment
                  of such amounts would result in a violation of section 30 of
                  the GMBHG.

8.3 VOTING/DIRECTORS OF DEFAULTING SHAREHOLDER. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein contained, and in addition to the third sentence of Section 11.3
of ZSG's articles of association, the parties hereto contractually
(SCHULDRECHTLICH) agree that upon a Triggering Event the Defaulting Shareholder
shall henceforth not be entitled to vote its Capital. Notwithstanding the third
sentence of Section 11.3 of ZSG's articles of association, provided that, upon
the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Non-Defaulting Shareholders neither
purchase the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital nor, within ninety Business Days
following such Triggering Event, resolve the redemption or Forced Transfer of
the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital pursuant to the provisions of Sections
8.2(a) and (b) hereof, the Defaulting Shareholder shall again be entitled to
exercise its right to vote its Capital.

8.4 OTHER REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, in addition to
the rights in Section 8.2 hereof, the Non-Defaulting Shareholders shall be
entitled to bring any action at law as may be permitted in order to recover
damages or to bring any proceedings in the nature of specific performance,
injunction or other remedy, it being acknowledged by the



                                       27
<Page>

Shareholders that damages at law may be an inadequate remedy for a default,
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

8.5 NON-WAIVER. No consent to, or waiver of, any breach or Triggering Event by
any Shareholder in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement shall
be deemed to be construed to be consent to, or waiver of, any other breach or
Triggering Event in the performance by that Shareholder of the same or any other
obligations of that Shareholder under this Agreement. Failure by any Shareholder
to complain of any act or failure to act of the other Shareholder or to declare
a Triggering Event in respect of the other Shareholder, shall not constitute a
waiver by that Shareholder of its rights under this Agreement.

8.6      DETERMINATION OF PURCHASE PRICE.

         (A)      APPRAISAL. For the purposes of Section 8.2 hereof, the
                  purchase price or compensation for the Defaulting
                  Shareholder's Capital shall be appraised (the "APPRAISAL") and
                  shall be equal to the Appraised Value of the Capital as
                  determined pursuant to this Section 8.6.

         (B)      SELECTION OF APPRAISERS. Following a Triggering Event, the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders and the Defaulting Shareholder
                  shall try to agree on an appraiser to conduct the Appraisal.
                  If such agreement cannot be reached within a period of ten
                  Business Days as of the date of the request by the first of
                  any of the Non-Defaulting Shareholders or the Defaulting
                  Shareholder to appoint an appraiser, both the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders and the Defaulting Shareholder shall nominate
                  their own appraiser by specifying the firm and the individual
                  within such firm to have responsibility for the appraisal
                  within a period of another ten Business Days. The right to
                  appoint an appraiser shall expire upon the expiration of the
                  second ten Business Day period.

         (C)      QUALIFICATION OF APPRAISERS AND CONDUCT OF EVALUATION. Each
                  appointed appraiser shall be an internationally recognized (i)
                  accounting firm, (ii) investment dealer, or (iii) firm
                  specializing in business evaluation. The Appraisal shall be
                  conducted by the appraiser(s) to determine the fair market
                  value of the Capital redeemed or to be transferred as of the
                  effective date of the transfer, redemption or Forced Transfer
                  as per Sections 8.2 (a) and (b) according to the evaluation

                  to time) accepted by the German Accounting Standard Board of
                  the German Institute of Accountants (HAUPTFACHAUSSCHUSS DES
                  INSTITUTES FUR WIRTSCHAFTSPRUFER). The Shareholder Loan's to
                  be sold by the Defaulting Shareholder shall be taken into
                  account as liability of ZSG in determining the fair market
                  value. The Defaulting Shareholder shall not participate in the
                  profit/loss of ZSG in respect of the then current financial
                  year though the date of transfer or redemption.

         (D)      BINDING RESULT IN CASE OF ONE APPRAISER. In case there is only
                  one appraiser appointed, the value determined by such
                  appraiser, who will act as arbitrating expert
                  (SCHIEDSGUTACHTER), shall be final, conclusive and binding
                  determination of the amount of the purchase price of, or
                  compensation for, the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital binding
                  upon the Defaulting Shareholder, the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders, any third party/parties designated by the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders and ZSG, and there shall be no
                  contest in respect thereof to any court or arbitration except
                  in case of manifest error by the appraiser, provided that a
                  notice claiming such manifest error is given no later than ten
                  Business Days following the receipt of the appraiser's written
                  decision. Sections 318 and 319 BGB are hereby excluded. There
                  shall be no subsequent change of the determinations of the
                  appraiser whether as a result of any tax field audit, any
                  change of financial statements of ZSG or otherwise.

         (E)      BINDING RESULT IN CASE OF TWO APPRAISERS. In case there are
                  two appraisers appointed, the mathematical average of the
                  values determined by such appraisers who will act as
                  arbitrating experts shall be final, conclusive and binding
                  determination of the amount of the purchase price of, or
                  compensation for, the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital which
                  amount shall be the Appraised Value binding upon the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders, the Defaulting Shareholder, any
                  third party/parties designated by the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders and ZSG, and there shall be no contest in respect
                  thereof to any court or arbitration except in case of manifest
                  error by any of the appraisers, provided that notice claiming
                  such manifest error is given within ten Business Days
                  following receipt of the respective appraisers' written
                  decision, and provided further that the difference between the
                  two values shall be equal to or



                                       29

                  less than 20% of the lower of the two values. If the
                  difference of the two values is higher than 20% of the lower
                  of the two values, the appraisers shall appoint, within thirty
                  Business Days of the submission of both of their values to the
                  Defaulting Shareholder, the Non-Defaulting Shareholders and
                  ZSG, a third appraiser who shall determine the fair market
                  value (acting as arbitrating expert) which shall be final,
                  conclusive and binding determination of the purchase price of,
                  or compensation for, the Defaulting Shareholder's Capital
                  binding upon the Non-Defaulting Shareholders, the Defaulting
                  Shareholder, any third party/parties designated by the
                  Non-Defaulting Shareholders and ZSG and in respect of which
                  there shall be no contest to any court or arbitration except
                  in case of manifest error by the third appraiser provided that
                  notice claiming such manifest error is given within ten
                  Business Days following receipt of the third appraiser's
                  written decision. In case the two appraisers cannot agree on a
                  third appraiser, the third appraiser shall be appointed by the
                  President of the INSTITUT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSPRUFER IN DEUTSCHLAND
                  e.V., Tersteegenstrasse 14, D-40474 Dusseldorf, at the request
                  of either the Defaulting Shareholder, the Non-Defaulting
                  Shareholders or ZSG. In each case Sections 318 and 319 BGB are
                  hereby excluded. There shall be no subsequent change of the
                  determinations of the appraiser(s) whether as a result of any
                  tax field audit, any change of financial statements of ZSG or
                  otherwise.

         (F)      ACCESS. ZSG and the Shareholders shall grant each appraiser
                  access to all relevant books of account, records, statements
                  and documents of ZSG and each of the Shareholders which may
                  relate to the business and affairs of ZSG. Each Shareholder
                  shall cooperate with each appraiser and provide to all
                  appraisers all information and documents reasonably requested
                  by any one of them. The Shareholders shall allow each
                  appraiser to retain such experts as the appraiser may deem
                  necessary to assist him in making his appraisal.

         (G)      PROCEDURE. The appraisers shall grant the Defaulting
                  Shareholder, the Non-Defaulting Shareholders (or, following
                  the acceptance by such third party, the third party designated
                  by the Non-Defaulting Shareholders) and ZSG the right to be
                  heard to the same extent as such right to be heard would have
                  to be granted by an arbitration panel in an arbitration which
                  is to take place in Germany. The procedure shall be conducted
                  in the English language.

         (H)      COSTS. The Defaulting Shareholder shall bear the costs and
                  expenses of the appraisals, including the fees of the
                  appraisers and of the INSTITUT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSPRUFER IN

         (b)      deliver to the Vendor a release by the Purchaser(s) with
                  respect to those matters which any of the Purchaser(s) knew or
                  ought to have known of in its capacity as a Shareholder, or as
                  a party hereto, of its claims against the Vendor in its
                  capacity as a Shareholder, except for any claims which may
                  arise out of the transactions of purchase and sale herein
                  contemplated; and

         (c)      to the extent legally possible, cause ZSG to deliver to the
                  Vendor a release by ZSG of all its claims against the Vendor
                  with respect to any matter or thing which the books and
                  records of ZSG reflect or which was done in the ordinary
                  course of ZSG's business and arising as a result of the Vendor
                  being a Shareholder.

9.4 COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES. From and after the occurrence of an event giving
rise to a transaction of purchase, sale and transfer to which this Article 9
applies until the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall not do, nor cause, nor
permit to be done, anything except that which is in the ordinary course of
business of ZSG. Further, the parties hereto covenant and agree that from and
after the occurrence of an event giving rise to a transaction of purchase and
sale pursuant to the terms hereof, they shall do all things necessary or
desirable to cause the transaction of purchase and sale to be completed as soon
as possible.

9.5 NO JOINT LIABILITY. For greater certainty, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the Purchasers in any transaction of sale and transfer
contemplated in this Agreement are not jointly liable for the payment of the
purchase price for the Sold Capital but are only liable for their proportionate
share thereof.

9.6 LIABILITY AS GUARANTOR. If, at the time of sale, the Vendor is liable or
responsible as a guarantor for any debts, liabilities or obligations of ZSG, the
Purchaser(s) shall use reasonable efforts to cause all such guarantees to be
released on or before the Closing Date and, if the Purchaser(s) are unable to
effect the release of such guarantees, the Purchaser(s) shall execute (or cause
the third party/parties designated by the Purchaser(s) to execute) in favor of
the Vendor an indemnity, in form and substance satisfactory to the Vendor acting




                                       32
<Page>

reasonably, whereby the Purchaser(s) (or the third party/parties designated by
the Purchaser(s)) indemnify and hold harmless the Vendor from all claims arising
out of such guarantees. Any liability of the Purchaser(s) (and the third
party/parties designated by the Purchaser(s)) shall be several (and not joint
and several) in proportion to the share of the Capital acquired by each
Purchaser.

9.7 VENDOR INDEBTED TO ZSG OR PURCHASER(S). If, at the time of sale and
transfer, the Vendor is indebted to the Purchaser(s), the Purchaser(s) shall
have the right to set off, appropriate and apply the purchase price payable for
the Sold Capital against and on account of such indebtedness to the
Purchaser(s). The parties agree that, if at the time of sale and transfer, the
Vendor is indebted to ZSG, to the extent permitted by law and the Financing
Documents, the principal amounts of the Shareholder Loans of the Vendor, if any,
shall be reduced by the amount of any such indebtedness (including interest
thereon through the date of set-off) by way of set-off immediately prior to the
Closing Date and such reduced amounts of principal shall be the basis for
determining the purchase price for such Shareholder Loans as per Sections 8.2(a)
and (b).

9.8 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. If any Governmental Approval is required by the
Purchaser(s), then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the
time period specified in this Agreement for acceptance of any offer by the
Purchaser(s) shall be extended for an additional sixty Business Days to permit
the Purchaser(s) to obtain the necessary Governmental Approval. Any such
application for Governmental Approval shall be the sole responsibility of the
Purchaser(s) who shall also be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred
in connection therewith. The other Shareholders and ZSG shall use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Purchaser(s) in any application for Governmental
Approval.



                    ARTICLE 10 - RELATIONSHIP OF SHAREHOLDERS


10.1 DISCLAIMER OF PARTNERSHIP. No partnership is created by this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to constitute the
parties hereto as partners nor as agent of the other nor any other relationship
whereby any party hereto could be held liable for any act or omission of the
other, save as specifically provided by this Agreement. None of the parties
hereto shall have any authority to act for the other or to incur any obligation
on behalf of the other with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement,




                                       33
<Page>

save as specifically provided by this Agreement. Each party hereto covenants to
indemnify the other parties and hold them harmless from all claims, losses,
costs, charges, fees, expenses, damages, obligations and responsibilities
incurred by such parties by reason of any action or omission of the other party
outside the scope of the authority specifically provided by this Agreement.

10.2 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. The parties acknowledge that the group of companies to
which Pulp Holding belongs presently operates in the pulp and paper industry and
presently indirectly owns and operates a kraft pulp mill located at
Blankenstein, Germany. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, any party hereto may independently engage in, be concerned with or
interested in, lend money to, or guarantee the debts or obligations of any
business endeavor whether or not competitive with the objects of the Project or
ZSG, without consulting the other parties and without in any way being
accountable to the other.

10.3 GOOD FAITH. Each party hereto shall act honestly and in good faith and in
the best interest of the Project and ZSG and shall exercise the degree of care,
diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in
comparable circumstances.

11.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. The Information shall be kept confidential and shall not,
without the prior consent of the other parties, be disclosed by a party hereto
or its representatives in any manner or in part and shall not be used by a party
hereto or its representatives, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other
than proceeding with the Project (which such proceeding shall include any
financing or investing arrangements reasonably required by a Shareholder to
finance all or part of its contribution of capital and loans), provided that
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit any of the parties from
making such releases or other form of disclosure as (i) may be required pursuant
to any laws, regulations or policies (including those of any stock exchange or
quotation system) applicable to it or (ii) may be made by a party pursuant to
customary written confidentiality agreements entered into by parties to consider
business opportunities.

The parties hereto each agree to furnish the Information only to the respective
representatives of a party hereto who need to know the Information for the
purposes of proceeding with the



                                       34
<Page>

Project and who are informed of the confidential nature of the Information and
agree to be bound by the terms hereof. The parties hereto each agree to be
responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of their respective
representatives provided that such breach occurs while such representative is
employed by or is under contract to such party. Each of the parties hereto shall
make all reasonable necessary and appropriate efforts to safeguard the
Information and the existence of discussions from disclosure to anyone other
than as permitted hereby. The foregoing shall be inoperative as to such portions
of the Information which (i) are or become generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by the parties hereto or their respective
representatives, (ii) are or become available to any of the parties hereto on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the other parties hereto or
their representatives or (iii) are or become known to any of the parties hereto
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the other parties hereto
or their representatives.

which, to the extent not explicitly superseded by provisions of this Agreement
or expired pursuant to its terms, shall remain in full force and effect)
represents the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions whether oral or written of the
parties thereto and there are no warranties, representations or other agreements

association of ZSG, which shall prevail.

into articles and sections and the insertion of headings and schedules are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, any reference in this Agreement to an

                                     ANNEX 1
                                ARBITRATION RULES

         1. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of two arbitrators and the
presiding arbitrator, each of whom shall be fluent in English and may be of
German or U.S. nationality. The party intending to institute arbitration
proceedings against one or more other parties shall inform the other parties in
writing of its intention and, at the same time, designate one arbitrator. The
other parties shall, within thirty Business Days after receipt of this notice,
designate a second arbitrator. If, within such time period, the other parties
have not designated a second arbitrator, then at the request of the party
intending to institute arbitration proceedings, the second arbitrator shall be
appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce, acting as appointing
authority. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall choose the presiding
arbitrator. If, within thirty Business Days after the appointment of the second
of the two arbitrators, the two arbitrators have not agreed upon the choice of
the presiding arbitrator, then at the request of either party to the arbitration
proceedings, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the International
Chamber of Commerce.

         2. All submissions and awards in relation to arbitration shall be made
in English and all arbitration proceedings and all pleadings shall be in
English. Original documents in English or German may be submitted as evidence in
their original language; witnesses not fluent in English may give evidence in
their native tongue (with appropriate translation). Original documents in a
language other than English or German shall be submitted as evidence in English
translation accompanied by the original or a true copy thereof.

         3. The parties hereby adopt the rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce as the procedural rules governing arbitration hereunder, insofar as
such rules are not inconsistent with any provision of this ANNEX 1, which shall
be controlling. The arbitration panel may, at the request of a party, order
provisional or conservatory measures and shall have the authority to award
specific performance, provided, however, that until the complete establishment
of the arbitration panel, the ordinary courts shall remain competent for
provisional or conservatory measures in accordance with section 1033 of the
German Civil Procedure Code (ZIVILPROZESSORDNUNG). Any award shall be final
and not subject to appeal and the parties hereby waive all challenge to any
award of an arbitral panel under this ANNEX 1.


<Page>

         4. Any award shall be made in the currency in which the obligation
would have been paid, if the obligation with respect to which the award is made
was an obligation to pay money, or in Euro in all other cases.
