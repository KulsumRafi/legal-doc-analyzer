Lender (collectively,  the "Original Loan and Security Agreement").  Capitalized
terms used herein  without  definition  have the  meanings  given to them in the
Original  Loan  Agreement.  The  Original  Loan  Agreement,  as  amended by this
Agreement,  and as such  agreement  otherwise  from  time to  time  has  been or
hereafter may be amended, modified,  extended, and supplemented,  is hereinafter
referred to as the "Loan and Security Agreement."

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

      Pursuant to the Original Loan and Security Agreement Lender may make loans
to fund Borrower's  acquisition of Eligible Collateral from time to time subject
to the terms and conditions of the Original Loan and Security Agreement.  Lender
and Borrower  desire to amend the Original Loan and Security  Agreement in order
to extend the term.

      NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.    Amendment.  The Original Loan and Security  Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:

      (a) Defined  Terms.  Subsection  1.01 of the  Original  Loan and  Security
Agreement is hereby amended by:

            (i) the  deletion  in its  entirety  of the  definition  of the term
"Amortization Period" and the substitution therefor of the following:

      "Amortization  Period"  shall  mean,  if the  Termination  Date  shall  be
extended in accordance  with the terms hereof,  the period from and after August
9, 2002 to, but not including, May 9, 2003.

            (ii) the deletion of the words "June 30, 2001" in subsection  (B) of
the  definition  of the  term  "Eurodollar  Rate  Spread"  and the  substitution
therefor with the words "August 9, 2002."

            (iii) the  deletion in its  entirety of the  definition  of the term
"Termination Date" and the substitution therefor of the following:

      "Termination  Date"  shall mean  August 9, 2002 or such  earlier
      date on which this Loan Agreement  shall terminate in accordance
      with the  provisions  hereof or by operation  of law;  provided,
      however,  that in the event  that (i) this  Agreement  shall not
      have been  earlier  terminated  and (ii) no  Default  shall have
      occurred and be  continuing on August 9, 2002,  the  Termination
      Date shall be automatically extended to May 8, 2003.

      (b)  Paragraph  (a) of  subsection  2.01 of the Original Loan and Security
Agreement is hereby amended by the deletion in the first sentence thereof of the
words "June 30,  2001" and the  substitution  therefor  of the words  "August 9,

      (c)  Subsection  3.01(a) of the Original  Loan and  Security  Agreement is
hereby deleted in its entirety and the following subsection shall be inserted in
lieu thereof:


<PAGE>


      "(a) Borrower hereby promises to repay in full on the Termination Date the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans;  provided,  however, in the
event the  Termination  Date shall be  extended  to May 9, 2003  pursuant to the
terms hereof,  Borrower promises to repay such aggregate principal amount of the
Loans  outstanding on August 9, 2002 by the payment on the first Business Day of
each month during the  Amortization  Period beginning with September 1, 2002 and
on the Termination Date, as extended (each, an "Installment  Date") of an amount
equal  to the  quotient  of (x) the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the  Loans
outstanding  as at August  9, 2002  divided  by (y) nine (9) (such  schedule  of
payments,  the "Amortization  Schedule");  provided,  further, that in the event
that Borrower shall repay any portion of the outstanding  principal in an amount
in excess of the amount then due and payable in accordance with the Amortization
Schedule,  the  Amortization  Schedule shall be recalculated  such that Borrower
shall repay the principal  amount of the Loans  outstanding  on the date of such
repayment  (after  taking such  repayment  into  account) by the payment on each
Installment Date remaining in the Amortization  Period of an amount equal to the
quotient of (x) the aggregate  principal amount of the Loans  outstanding on the
date of such repayment (after taking such repayment into account) divided by (y)
the number of Installment  Dates remaining during the Amortization  Period.  Any
repayment of the principal of the Loans made by Borrower to Lender subsequent to
an Installment Date shall be credited at the time of such payment and applied to
the payment due on next succeeding Installment Date."

2.    Representations and Warranties.

      Borrower  hereby makes to Lender the  representations  and  warranties set
forth  in  Section  6  of  the  Original  Loan  and  Security  Agreement.   Such
representations  and warranties are true and correct as though made on and as of
the date hereof and after giving effect to this Agreement,  except to the extent
such representations and warranties refer to an earlier date.

3.    No Default.

      No  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  or will  result  from the
execution,  delivery or performance of this  Agreement,  the  performance of the
Original  Loan and  Security  Agreement,  as amended by this  Agreement,  or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.    Ratification and Confirmation.

      Borrower  hereby (i)  ratifies  and  confirms  all of the  obligations  of
Borrower under the Original Loan and Security Agreement (as amended hereby), the
Note and the other Loan  Documents and (ii)  represents,  warrants and covenants
that, as of the date hereof, Borrower has no cause of action at law or in equity
against Lender (including, without limitation, any offset, defense, deduction or
counterclaim) with respect to any of such obligations.

5.    Binding Effect; No Waiver; No Partnership; Counterparts.

      The  provisions  of the  Original  Loan and  Security  Agreement  and this
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed or construed  (a) to  constitute a waiver of any right of Lender
under the Original Loan and Security  Agreement,  as amended, or (b) to create a
partnership or joint venture between any of the parties hereto.  For the purpose
of  facilitating  the  execution  of this  Agreement  as herein  provided,  this
Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts,  each of
which counterparts shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts when
taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

Agreement as amended hereby.

8.    Costs and Expenses.

      Borrower  shall  pay  as  and  when  billed  by  the  Lender  all  of  the
out-of-pocket  costs and expenses of the Lender  incurred in connection with the
development,  preparation, execution, delivery and administration,  modification
and  amendment  of this  Agreement,  and the  other  documents  to be  delivered
