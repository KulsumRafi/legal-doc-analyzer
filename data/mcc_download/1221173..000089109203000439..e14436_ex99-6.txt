      WHEREAS, the Seller acquired certain fixed and adjustable rate,
conventional, 103% loan-to-value ratio loans from the Servicer, which such
mortgage loans were either originated or acquired by the Servicer pursuant to
the Master Mortgage Loan Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of February 1,
2003 (the "Sale and Servicing Agreement"), and annexed as Exhibit B hereto.

      WHEREAS, the Seller has conveyed certain mortgage loans as identified on
Exhibit C hereto (the "Mortgage Loans") to Structured Asset Securities
Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO"), which in turn has
conveyed the Mortgage Loans to Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"),
pursuant to a trust agreement dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Trust
Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora Loan Services Inc., as master servicer
("Aurora," and, together with any successor Master Servicer appointed pursuant
to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer") and SASCO.

      WHEREAS, the Mortgage Loans are currently being serviced by the Servicer
for the Seller pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Seller desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the rights of
the Seller (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the rights and
obligations of the Servicer hereunder as permitted under Section 10.02 of the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, as amended hereby and subject to the other
conditions set forth herein.

      WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the Sale
and Servicing Agreement shall continue to apply to the Mortgage Loans, but only
to the extent provided herein and that this Agreement shall govern the Mortgage
Loans for so long as such Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the
Trust Agreement and until the Transfer Date.

      WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer agree that if a successor servicer is
appointed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer shall no longer
service the Mortgage Loans and shall transfer servicing of the Mortgage Loans to
the successor servicer designated by the Seller herein.

      WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Mortgage Loans
on behalf of the Trustee,

and shall have the right under the conditions specified herein to terminate for
cause the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer intend that each of the Master
Servicer and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Seller and the Servicer hereby agree as
follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement,
including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are
defined in the Sale and Servicing Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in the Trust Agreement.

      2. Custodianship. The parties hereto acknowledge that U.S. Bank, National
Association will act as custodian of the Mortgage Files for the Trustee pursuant
to a Custodial Agreement, dated February 1, 2003, between U.S. Bank, National
Association and the Trustee.

      3. Servicing. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to
perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that are to be
performed and observed under the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
except as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and that the
provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, as so modified, are and shall be
a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full.

      4. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including any
successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the Master
Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the Servicer
services the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the SASCO 2003-7H Trust
Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust Agreement, shall have the
same rights as the Seller under the Sale and Servicing Agreement to enforce the
obligations of the Servicer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the term
"Initial Owner" or "Owner" as used in the Sale and Servicing Agreement in
connection with any rights of the Initial Owner or Owner shall refer to the
Trust Fund or, as the context requires, the Master Servicer acting in its
capacity as agent for the Trust Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A
hereto. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the rights and
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement upon the failure of the
Servicer to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, which failure
results in an Event of Default as provided in Section 9.01 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the Master Servicer assume any of the obligations of the Seller
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement and in connection with the performance of
the Master Servicer's duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto
agree that the Master Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights,
protections and limitations of liability afforded to the Master Servicer under
the Trust Agreement.

            insuring a minimum, fixed


                                      A-5
<PAGE>

            or floating rate of return on investments of such funds, which
            contract or surety bond shall:

                  (a) be an obligation of an insurance company or other
            corporation whose long-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in
            one of its two highest rating categories or, if such insurance
            company has no long-term debt, whose claims paying ability is rated
            by each Rating Agency in one of its two highest rating categories,
            and whose short-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in its
            highest rating category;

                  (b) provide that the Company may exercise all of the rights
            under such contract or surety bond without the necessity of taking
            any action by any other Person;

                  (c) provide that if at any time the then current credit
            standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract is
            such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of funds
            would result in a downgrading of any rating of the Company, the
            Company shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
            entitled to the return of all funds previously invested thereunder,
            together with accrued interest thereon at the interest rate provided
            under such contract to the date of delivery of such funds to the
            Trustee;

                  (d) provide that the Company's interest therein shall be
            transferable to any successor Company or the Master Servicer
            hereunder; and

                  (e) provide that the funds reinvested thereunder and accrued
            interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account, as the case
            may be, not later than the Business Day prior to any Determination
            Date.

13.   The definition of "Servicing Fee" in Article I is hereby amended and
      restated in its entirety to read as follows:

            Servicing Fee: An amount equal to one-twelfth the product of (a)
            0.25% per annum (the "Servicing Fee Rate") and (b) the outstanding
            principal balance of the Mortgage Loan. The Servicing Fee is payable
            solely from the interest portion (including recoveries with respect
            to interest from Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds,
            Insurance Proceeds, REO Disposition Proceeds) of such Monthly
            Payment collected by the Company or as otherwise provided under this
            Agreement.

14.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.03 (Custodial Agreement;
      Delivery of Mortgage Loan Documents) shall be inapplicable to this
      Agreement, as superseded by the provisions of the Custodial Agreement and
      the Trust Agreement.

15.   Section 4.01 (Company to Act as Servicer) is hereby amended and restated
      in its entirety to read as follows:


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

                  From the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loans to
            the related Closing Date, the Company shall have serviced the
            related Mortgage Loans in accordance with Customary Servicing
            Procedures. From and after the related Closing Date, the Company, as
            an independent contractor, shall service and administer the Mortgage
            Loans pursuant to this Agreement and shall have full power and
            authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with
            such servicing and administration which the Company may deem
            necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement
            and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Company may
            waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to
            the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any
            manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Company's
            reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
            postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Owner,
            provided, however, that (unless the Mortgagor is in default with
            respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of
            the Company, imminent and the Company has obtained the prior written
            consent of the Owner) the Company shall not permit any modification
            with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage
            Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of principal or
            interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance
            (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final
            maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. With respect to a
            Reconstitution Agreement, in the event of any such modification
            which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments on any
            Mortgage Loan, the Company shall, on the Business Day immediately
            preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
            principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the
            Custodial Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section
            4.04, the difference between (a) such month's principal and one
            month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid
            principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by
            the Mortgagor. With the approval of the Master Servicer, the Company
            shall be entitled to reimbursement for such advances only to the
            same extent as for P&I Advances made pursuant to Section 5.03
            hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Company shall continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered, to
            execute and deliver on behalf of itself and the Owner, all
            instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full
            release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with
            respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged
            Properties. If reasonably required by the Company, the Owner shall
            furnish the Company with any powers of attorney and other documents
            necessary or appropriate to enable the Company to carry out its
            servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement.

                  Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
            consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the Company shall
            forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing
            such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
            Agreement, the Company shall not make or permit any


                                      A-7
<PAGE>

            modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan
            that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to fail
            to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under
            Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Company
            shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and
            exercise the same care that it customarily employs and exercises in
            servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account,
            giving due consideration to Customary Servicing Procedures where
            such practices do not conflict with the requirements of this
            Agreement, and the Owner's reliance on the Company.

                  Absent written consultation and approval by the Owner, as
            specified in this Section 4.01, the Company may take actions
            relative to the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans
            that are consistent with Customary Servicing Procedures.

16.   The parties hereto acknowledge that references to the "Owner" in the first
      paragraph of Section 4.02 shall refer to the Master Servicer, except that
      the expense of any environmental inspection or review at the request of
      the Master Servicer shall be an expense of the Trust Fund.

17.   The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the Custodial Account referenced
      in Section 4.04 shall be titled "GMAC Mortgage Corporation in trust for
      SASCO 2003-7H" and (ii) references to the Cutoff Date shall mean the close
      of business on February 1, 2003.

18.   The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the Escrow Account referenced in
      Section 4.06 shall be titled "GMAC Mortgage Corporation in trust for SASCO
      2003-7H."

19.   Section 4.14 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is hereby
      amended by (i) adding two new paragraphs after the second paragraph
      thereof to read as follows:

            In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property in
      connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan, the
      Company shall dispose of such REO Property not later than the end of the
      third taxable year after the year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund
      unless the Company has applied for and received a grant of extension from
      the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that, under the REMIC
      Provisions and any relevant proposed legislation and under applicable
      state law, the applicable Trust REMIC may hold REO Property for a longer
      period without adversely affecting the REMIC status of such REMIC or
      causing the imposition of a federal or state tax upon such REMIC. If the
      Company has received such an extension, then the Company shall continue to
      attempt to sell the REO Property for its fair market value for such period
      longer than three years as such extension permits (the "Extended Period").
      If the Company has not received such an extension and the Company is
      unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending 3 months before
      the end of such third taxable year after its acquisition by the Trust Fund
      or if the Company has received such an extension, and the Company is
      unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending


                                      A-8
<PAGE>

      three months before the close of the Extended Period, the Company shall,
      before the end of the three year period or the Extended Period, as
      applicable, (i) purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the REO
      Property's fair market value or (ii) auction the REO Property to the
      highest bidder (which may be the Company) in an auction reasonably
      designed to produce a fair price prior to the expiration of the three-year
      period or the Extended Period, as the case may be. The Trustee shall sign
      any document or take any other action reasonably requested by the Company
      which would enable the Company, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to request
      such grant of extension.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO
      Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to
      continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust Fund
      in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i) cause such REO
      Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning
      of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii) subject any Trust REMIC to the
      imposition of any federal income taxes on the income earned from such REO
      Property, including any taxes imposed by reason of Sections 860F or
      860G(c) of the Code, unless the Company has agreed to indemnify and hold
      harmless the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

            (ii) adding the following to the end of such Section:

            Prior to acceptance by the Company of an offer to sell any REO
      Property, the Company shall notify the Master Servicer of such offer in
      writing which notification shall set forth all material terms of said
      offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer shall be deemed to
      have approved the sale of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer
      notifies the Company in writing, within five (5) days after its receipt of
      the related Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the related sale, in
      which case the Company shall not proceed with such sale.

20.   Section 5.02 (Statements to the Owner) is hereby amended and restated in
      its entirety as follows:

      Section 5.02 Statements to the Master Servicer.

            Not later than the tenth calendar day of each month, the Company
      shall furnish to the Master Servicer (a) a monthly remittance and
      reporting format in the format currently being used and agreed upon by the
      Company and by the Master Servicer as to the accompanying remittance and
      the period ending on the last day of the preceding Determination Date and
      (b) all such information required pursuant to clause (a) above on a
      magnetic tape or other similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master
      Servicer.

            Beginning with calendar year 2003, the Company shall prepare and
      file any and all tax returns, information statements or other filings for
      the portion of the tax year 2003 and the portion of subsequent tax years
      for which the Company has serviced some or all of the Mortgage Loans
      hereunder as such returns, information statements or other filings are
      required to be delivered to any governmental taxing authority or to the
      Master Servicer pursuant to any applicable law with respect to the
      Mortgage Loans and the


                                      A-9
<PAGE>

      transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Company shall provide
      the Master Servicer with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans as
      is necessary for the Master Servicer to prepare the Trust Fund's federal
      income tax return as the Master Servicer may reasonably request from time
      to time.

21.   Section 5.03 (P&I Advances by the Company) is hereby amended and restated
      in its entirety as follows:

            On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, the
      Company shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds an
      amount equal to all Monthly Payments (with interest adjusted to the
      Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate) which were due on the Mortgage Loans during
      the applicable Due Period and which were delinquent at the close of
      business on the immediately preceding Determination Date or which were
      deferred pursuant to Section 4.01. Any amounts held for future
      distribution and so used to make P&I Advances shall be replaced by the
      Company by deposit in the Custodial Account on or before any future
      Remittance Date if funds in the Custodial Account on such Remittance Date
      shall be less than payments to the Trust Fund required to be made on such
      Remittance Date. The Company's obligation to make such P&I Advances as to
      any Mortgage Loan will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior
      to the payment in full of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last
      Remittance Date prior to the Remittance Date for the distribution of all
      Liquidation Proceeds and other payments or recoveries (including Insurance
      Proceeds and Condemnation Proceeds) with respect to the Mortgage Loan
      unless the Company deems such P&I Advances to be unrecoverable, as
      evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Company delivered to the
      Master Servicer.

22.   Section 6.03 (Servicing Compensation) is hereby amended by adding the
      following sentence at the end of such Section:

                  The Company shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by
            it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall
            not be entitled to reimbursement thereof except as specifically
            provided for herein.

23.   Section 6.04 (Annual Statement as to Compliance) is hereby amended by (i)
      replacing "Owner" with "Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB and Master Servicer",
      (ii) replacing "March 31 of each year" with "the last day of February of
      each year" and (iii) replacing "March 31, 2004" with "February 28, 2004".

24.   Section 6.05 (Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report) is
      hereby amended by (i) replacing "March 31 of each year" with "the last day
      of February of each year", (ii) replacing "March 31, 2004" with "February
      28, 2004" and (iii) replacing "Owner" with "Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB and
      Master Servicer".

25.   A new Section 6.09 is hereby added to this Agreement to read as follows:

            (a) By February 28th of each year (of if not a Business Day, the
      immediately preceding Business Day), commencing with February 28, 2004, an
      officer of the Company shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate
      in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto, signed by an officer of the
      Company, to the Master Servicer and the


                                      A-10
<PAGE>

      Depositor for the benefit of such Master Servicer and such Depositor and
      their respective officers, directors and affiliates, certifying as to the
      following matters:

                  (1) I have reviewed the information required to be delivered
            to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Agreement (the "Servicing
            Information").

                  (2) Based on my knowledge, the information relating to the
            Mortgage Loans submitted by the Company in its monthly reporting
            packages delivered to the Master Servicer which is contained in the
            reports on Form 8-K and the annual report on Form 10-K with respect
            to the Transaction, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading as of the date
            of this certification;

                  (3) Based on my knowledge, the Servicing Information required
            to be provided to the Master Servicer by the Company under this
            Agreement has been provided to the Master Servicer;

                  (4) I am responsible for reviewing the activities performed by
            the Company under this Agreement and based upon the review required
            hereunder, and except as disclosed in the Annual Statement of
            Compliance, the Annual Independent Certified Public Accountant's
            Servicing Report and all servicing reports, officer's certificates
            and other information relating to the servicing of the Mortgage
            Loans submitted to the Master Servicer, the Company has, as of this
            certification fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement; and

                  (5) I have disclosed to the Master Servicer and the Depositor
            all significant deficiencies relating to the Company's compliance
            with the minimum servicing standards in accordance with a review
            conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program
            for Mortgage Bankers or similar standard as set forth in this
            Agreement.

26.   Sections 8.01 (Indemnification; Third Party Claims) is hereby amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:

                  The Company shall indemnify the Trust Fund, the Trustee and
            the Master Servicer and hold each of them harmless against any and
            all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
            reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgements,
            and any other costs, fees and expenses that any of such parties may
            sustain directly resulting from the failure of the Company to
            perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Company immediately
            shall notify Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, the Master Servicer and the
            Trustee or any other relevant party if a claim is made by a third
            party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume
            (with the prior written consent of the indemnified party) the
            defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
            therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
            satisfy any judgement or decree which may


                                      A-11
<PAGE>

            be entered against it or any of such parties in respect of such
            claim. The Company shall follow any written instructions received
            from the Trustee in connection with such claim. The Trustee, from
            the assets of the Trust Fund, promptly shall reimburse the Company
            for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding sentence
            except when the claim is in any way relates to the failure of the
            Company to service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  The Trust Fund shall indemnify the Company and hold it
            harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
            fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related

            or the Master Servicer to perform its duties in compliance with the
            terms of this Agreement.

                  In the event a dispute arises between an indemnified party and
            the Company with respect to any of the rights and obligations of the
            parties pursuant to this Agreement and such dispute is adjudicated
            in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any other judicial
            process, then the losing party shall indemnify and reimburse the
            winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs and expenses
            related to the adjudication of said dispute.

27.   Section 9.01 (Events of Default) is hereby amended as follows:

      (a) Amending Subsection 9.01(vii) in its entirety to read as follows: "the
      Company at any time is neither a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved
      servicer, and the Master Servicer has not terminated the rights and
      obligations of the Company under this Agreement and replaced the Company
      with a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved servicer within 30 days of the
      absence of such approval."

      (b) Replacing the last paragraph thereof with the following:

                  Upon receipt by the Company of such written notice, all
            authority and power of the Company under this Agreement, whether
            with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and
            be vested in a successor Company appointed by the Lehman Brothers
            Bank, FSB and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from the
            Seller, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to the
            successor entity designated by the Seller any and all documents and
            other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
            Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things
            necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
            termination, including but not limited to the transfer and
            endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related

            cooperate with Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB and the Master Servicer and
            such successor in effecting the termination of the Company's
            responsibilities and rights hereunder, including without limitation,

            Mortgage Loans.

28.   The parties hereto acknowledge that the word "Owner" in Section 9.02
      (Waiver of Defaults) shall refer to the "Master Servicer with the prior
      consent of the Trustee."

29.   10.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended by replacing the first
      paragraph thereof with the following paragraphs:

            Section 10.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
            distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the
            last Mortgage Loan to the Trust Fund (or advances by the Company for
            the same), and (b) the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon
            foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all
            funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent of the Company, Lehman
            Brothers Bank, FSB and the Master Servicer in writing or (iii) at
            the sole option of the Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, without cause,
            upon 30 days written notice. Any such notice of termination shall be
            in writing and delivered to the Company by registered mail to the
            address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Master
            Servicer, the Trustee and the Company shall comply with the
            termination procedures set forth in Article X.

                  In connection with any such termination referred to in clause
            (ii) above, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB will be responsible for
            reimbursing the Company for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing
            Advances within 15 Business Days following the date of termination
            and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated
            with any transfer of servicing.

                  In connection with any such termination referred to in clause
            (iii) above, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB will be responsible for
            paying a sum, as liquidated damages, in an amount equal to (I) two
            percent (2%) of the aggregate Assumed Principal Balance of the
            Mortgage Loans (as defined herein) if such written notice is
            received by the Company on or before the Business Day five years
            from the date such Mortgage Loans were sold by the Company to Lehman
            Brothers Bank, FSB, or (II) one percent (1%) of the aggregate
            Assumed Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans if such written
            notice is received by the Company after the Business Day five years
            from the date such Mortgage Loans were sold by the Company to Lehman
            Brothers Bank, FSB (either amount shall be referred to as
            "Liquidated Damages").

30.   Section 11.01 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

                  Simultaneously with the termination of the Company's
            responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
            Sections 8.03, 9.01 or 10.01(a)(ii), the Master Servicer shall, in
            accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed to
            and assume all of the Company's responsibilities, rights, duties and


                                      A-13
<PAGE>

            obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor
            meeting the eligibility requirements of this Agreement and (iii) and
            which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the
            responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Company under this
            Agreement with the termination of the Company's responsibilities,
            duties and liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the
            Company that is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage loans
            for the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of the Master
            Servicer, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, the Trustee and each Rating
            Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement). Unless the
            successor servicer is at that time a servicer of other mortgage
            loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency must deliver to the
            Trustee a letter to the effect that such transfer of servicing will
            not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the
            then-current rating of any of the Certificates. In connection with
            such appointment and assumption, the Master Servicer or Lehman
            Brothers Bank, as applicable, may make such arrangements for the
            compensation of such successor out of payments on the Mortgage Loans
            as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no
            such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Company
            under this Agreement. In the event that the Company's duties,
            responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be
            terminated pursuant to the aforementioned sections, the Company
            shall discharge such duties and responsibilities during the period
            from the date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the
            effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence and
            prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and
            shall take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the
            rights or financial condition of its successor. The resignation or
            removal of the Company pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall
            not become effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant
            to this Section 11.01 and shall in no event relieve the Company of
            the representations and warranties made pursuant to Article X shall
            be applicable to the Company notwithstanding any such resignation or
            termination of the Company, or the termination of this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
            than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Company
            shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and
            all documents and other instruments, place in such successor's
            possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other
            acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
            such notice of termination. The Company shall cooperate with the
            Trustee and the Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor
            in effecting the termination of the Company's responsibilities and
            rights hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to
            the successor Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer
            to such successor for administration by it of all cash amounts which
            shall at the time be credited by the Company to the Custodial
            Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
            the Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
            acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Company and the Master
            Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
            successor shall make an assumption of the due and punctual
            performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
            performed and observed by the Company under this Agreement,
            whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
            rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Company, with like effect as if originally named
            as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of the
            Company or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.01
            or 10.02 shall not affect any claims that the Master Servicer or the
            Trustee may have against the Company arising out of the Company's
            actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or
            resignation.

                  Within three (3) Business Days of the appointment of a
            successor servicer, the Company shall deliver to the successor
            servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account and
            all Mortgage Loan Documents and related documents and statements
            held by it hereunder and the Company shall account for all funds and
            shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things
            as may reasonably be required to more fully and definitively vest in
            the successor all such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities,
            obligations and liabilities of the Company.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
            Company shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
            appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth
            herein.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
            costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of
            servicing hereunder (whether as a result of termination or removal
            of the Company or resignation of the Company or otherwise),
            including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of the Master
            Servicer or any other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or
            of the Master Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the
            Company hereunder, or of transferring the Servicing Files and the
            other necessary data to the successor servicer shall be paid by the
            terminated, removed or resigning Company from its own funds without
            reimbursement.

31.   A new Section 11.14 is hereby added to read as follows:

            Section 11.14 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

                  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
            parties to this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in
            furtherance of the intent of such parties as set forth herein, that
            the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the benefit of the
            provisions of this Agreement as intended third party beneficiaries
            of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions. The Company
            shall have the same obligations to the Master Servicer and the
            Trustee as if they were parties to this Agreement, and the Master
            Servicer and the Trustee shall have the same rights


                                      A-15
<PAGE>

            and remedies to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if they
            were parties to this Agreement. The Company shall only take
            direction from the Master Servicer (if direction by the Master
            Servicer is required under this Agreement) unless otherwise directed
            by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights and
            obligations of the Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder (other
            than the right to indemnification) shall terminate upon termination
            of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust
            Agreement.
