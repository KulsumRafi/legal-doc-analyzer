                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

      5.1 Further Assurances. From time to time after the date hereof, and
without any further consideration, the parties to this Agreement agree to
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such additional deeds, assignments, bills
of sale, conveyances, instruments, notices, releases, acquittances and other
documents, and will do all such other acts and things, all in accordance with
applicable law, as may be necessary or appropriate (i) more fully to assure that
the applicable parties to this Agreement own all of the properties, rights,
titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges granted by this
Agreement, or which are intended to be so granted, (ii) more fully and
effectively to vest in the applicable parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns beneficial and record title to the interests
contributed and assigned by this Agreement or intended so to be and (iii) more
fully and effectively to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

      5.2 Power of Attorney. Each party (collectively, the "Contributing
Parties") that has conveyed assets (collectively, the "Conveyed Assets") as
reflected by this Agreement hereby constitutes and appoints GP LP (the
"Attorney-in-Fact"), its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution for it and in its name, place and stead or otherwise on behalf of
the applicable Contributing Party and its successors and assigns, and for the
benefit of the Attorney-in-Fact to demand and receive from time to time the
Conveyed Assets contributed and to execute in the name of the applicable
Contributing Party and its successors and assigns instruments of conveyance,
instruments of further assurance and to give receipts and releases in respect of
the same, and from time to time to institute and prosecute in the name of the
applicable Contributing Party for the benefit of the Attorney-in-Fact, any and
all proceedings at law, in equity or otherwise which the Attorney-in-Fact may
deem proper in order to (i) collect, assert or enforce any claims, rights or
titles of any kind in and to the Conveyed Assets, (ii) defend and compromise any
and all actions, suits or proceedings in respect of any of the Conveyed Assets,
and (iii) do any and all such acts and things in furtherance of this Agreement
as the Attorney-in-Fact shall deem advisable. Each Contributing Party hereby
declares that the appointment hereby made and the powers hereby granted are
coupled with an interest and are and shall be irrevocable and perpetual and
shall not be terminated by any act of any Contributing Party or its successors
or assigns or by operation of law.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      6.1 Order of Completion of Transactions. The transactions provided for in
Articles II (except as otherwise noted) and III of this Agreement shall be
completed on the Effective Date in the following order:

            First, the transactions provided for in Article II shall be
completed in the order set forth therein; and

            Second, the transactions provided for in Article III shall be
completed in the order set forth therein.

      6.2 Consents; Restriction on Assignment. If there are prohibitions against
or conditions to the contribution and conveyance of one or more of the Conveyed
Assets without the prior written consent of third parties, including, without
limitation, governmental agencies (other than consents of a ministerial nature
which are normally granted in the ordinary course of business), which if not
satisfied would result in a material breach of such prohibitions or conditions
or would give an outside party the right to terminate rights of the party to
whom the applicable assets were intended to be conveyed (the "Beneficial Owner")
with respect to such portion of the Conveyed Assets (herein called a
"Restriction"), then any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the transfer of title to or interest in each such portion of
the Conveyed Assets (herein called the "Restriction Asset") pursuant to this
Agreement shall not become effective unless and until such Restriction is
satisfied, waived or no longer applies. When and if such a Restriction is so
satisfied, waived or no longer applies, to the extent permitted by applicable
law and any applicable contractual provisions, the assignment of the Restriction
Asset subject thereto shall become effective automatically as of the Effective
Time, without further action on the part of any party to this Agreement. Each of
the applicable parties to this Agreement that were involved with the conveyance
of a Restriction Asset agree to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain on a
timely basis satisfaction of any Restriction applicable to any Restriction Asset
conveyed by or acquired by any of them. The description of any portion of the
Conveyed Assets as a "Restriction Asset" shall not be construed as an admission
that any Restriction exists with respect to the transfer of such portion of the
Conveyed Assets. In the event that any Restriction Asset exists, the applicable
party agrees to continue to hold such Restriction Asset in trust for the
exclusive benefit of the applicable party to whom such Restriction Asset was
intended to be conveyed and to otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to
provide such other party with the benefits thereof, and the party holding such
Restriction Asset will enter into other agreements, or take such other action as
it may deem necessary, in order to ensure that the applicable party to whom such
Restriction Asset was intended to be conveyed has the assets and concomitant
rights necessary to enable the applicable party to operate such Restriction
Asset in all material respects as it was operated prior to the Effective Time.

      6.3 Costs. The MLP shall pay, or reimburse the other parties hereto for
their payment of, all sales, use and similar taxes arising out of the
contributions, conveyances and deliveries to be made hereunder, and shall pay
all documentary, filing, recording, transfer, deed, and conveyance taxes and
fees required in connection therewith. In addition, the MLP shall be


                                       16

reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the satisfaction or
waiver of any Restriction pursuant to Section 6.2.

payment for reimbursement by the Ark Operators under the terms of such leases.
To the extent the Ark Operators reimburse ACIN LLC for the Ark Reservations

Reservations Taxes as have been paid by WPP, within a reasonable time of such
payment for reimbursement by the WPP Operators under the terms of such leases.
To the extent the WPP Operators reimburse WPP LLC for the WPP Reservations
Taxes, WPP LLC shall forward such amounts to WPP. WPP LLC shall be responsible
for submitting proof of payment by WPP LLC of the WPP Taxes to the WPP Operators

property taxes relating to the New Gauley Assets (herein collectively referred
to as the "New Gauley Taxes") for which tax bills are received prior to the
Closing Date shall be paid by New Gauley and all such tax bills received on and
after the Closing Date shall be paid by NNG LLC. New Gauley shall bear all real
estate and personal property taxes relating to the New Gauley Reservations (the
"New Gauley Reservations Taxes") for all periods of time, both before and after
the Closing Date. As soon as practical after the Closing Date, New Gauley and

the timely payment of the New Gauley Reservations Taxes and provide to NNG LLC
proof of payment of said taxes. NNG LLC shall then submit to the lessees of the

Gauley Reservations Taxes as have been paid by New Gauley, within a reasonable
time of such payment for reimbursement by the New Gauley Operators under the
terms of such leases. To the extent the New Gauley Operators reimburse NNG LLC

property taxes relating to the Great Northern Assets (herein collectively
referred to as the "Great Northern Taxes") for which tax bills are received
prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by Great Northern and all such tax bills
received on and after the Closing Date shall be paid by GNP LLC. Great Northern
shall bear all real estate and personal property taxes relating to the Great
Northern Reservations (the "Great Northern Reservations Taxes") for all periods
of time, both before and after the Closing Date. As soon as practical after the
Closing Date, Great Northern and GNP LLC shall, to the extent possible, cause

the Great Northern Reservations Taxes. After tax bills are received based on the
separate assessment of the Great Northern Taxes and the Great Northern
Reservations Taxes, Great Northern shall be responsible for the timely payment
of the Great Northern Reservations Taxes and provide to GNP LLC proof of payment
of said taxes. GNP LLC shall then submit to


                                       18
