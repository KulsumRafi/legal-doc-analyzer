<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly-held corporations, the possibility of a change in control of the Company exists and that such

the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued employment and dedication of

respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment and (iii)&nbsp;the amount of the "Gross-Up Payment" (as defined below) due to the Executive with respect to such Contingent Compensation
Payment. Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after delivery of such notice to the Executive, the Executive shall deliver a response to the Company (the "Executive Response") stating either (A)&nbsp;that
the Executive agrees with the Company's determination pursuant to the preceding sentence or (B)&nbsp;that the Executive disagrees with such determination, in which case the Executive shall indicate
which payment and/or benefits should be characterized as a Contingent Compensation Payment, the amount of the Excise Tax with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment and the amount of the
Gross-Up Payment due to the Executive with respect to such Contingent Compensation Payment. If the Executive states in the Executive Response that the Executive agrees with the Company's
determination, the Company shall make the Gross-Up Payment to the Executive within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response. If the Executive states
in the Executive Response that the Executive disagrees with the Company's determination, then, for a period of fifteen (15)&nbsp;days following delivery of the Executive Response, the Executive and
the Company shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within such fifteen (15)&nbsp;day period, such dispute shall be settled exclusively by arbitration
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.
The Company shall, within three business days following delivery to the Company of the Executive Response, make to the Executive those Gross-Up Payments as to which there is no dispute
between the Company and the Executive regarding whether they should be made. The balance of the Gross-Up Payments shall be made within three business days following the resolution of such
dispute. The amount of any payments to be made to the Executive following the resolution of such dispute shall be increased by the amount of the accrued interest thereon computed at the prime rate
announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal compounded monthly from the date that such payments originally were due. In the event that the Executive fails to deliver an Executive Response
