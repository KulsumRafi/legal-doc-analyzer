                      AMENDMENT TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS  AMENDMENT  TO  STOCK  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT  ("Agreement") has been made and
entered  into  as  of this 10th day of February, 2003, between Cirmaker Industry
Co.,  Ltd. incorporated under the Company Law of the Republic of China ("Seller"
or  the  "Company"), and Wrestle-plex Sports Entertainment Group, Ltd., a Nevada
Corporation  (the  "Purchaser").

                                R E C I T A L S:

A.     On  or  about December 2, 2002, the parties entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement  (the "Agreement") pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase from
the  Seller  an aggregate of at least 80% of the common stock of Seller from new
capital  stock  issued  by  the  Seller.

B.     The  parties  now  intend  by  this  agreement  to  modify  and amend the
Agreement  in  the  following  particulars,  leaving all other provisions of the
Agreement  as  heretofore  provided.

C.     Seller  has  delivered  approximately 16,100,000 shares of the Company to
China  Trust  Securities  as  Escrow Holder and Purchaser will deliver 8,050,000
shares  of Purchaser to China Trust Securities as consideration for these shares
prior  to  Closing  (the  "Initial  Exchange").

D.     Purchaser  has  agreed  to  extend the exchange offer for a period of six
months  following  the Initial Exchange for any additional shares of the Company
that  are  submitted  to  escrow  for  exchange  with  Purchaser  ("Subsequent
Exchanges").

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  mutual  agreements  and  covenants
contained  herein, the parties hereto agree as follows and do thereby adopt this
Agreement.

1.     The  definition  of  Closing  date  in  Article  I  shall  be:

"Closing  Date" shall mean on or before February 28, 2003, plus any extension as
provided  herein,  or  such other date as agreed in writing to by the parties on
which  the  Closing  occurs."

2.     Paragraph  2.1  of  the  Agreement  is  amended  to  read  as  follows:

"Stock  Sale.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Closing Documents, the
Seller  hereby  agrees to sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser
hereby  agrees  to purchase and accept, the Transferred Shares, in consideration
for  the  delivery  of one share of Purchaser's common stock for each two of the
Transferred  Shares  (the "Purchase Price") properly delivered through escrow as
provided  in  paragraph  5.4  herein.

Seller  shall  be  granted  registration  rights  for each of the Purchase Price
shares  in  which each of the shares shall be registered with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  within  six  months  of  the  Company's  full listing on a
National  US  Exchange,  but  no  later than twenty four months from the Closing
Date."

3.     Add  a  new  Paragraph  5.4  which  shall  read  as  follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

"5.4     Escrow of Shares.     The exchange of the Purchase Price shares and the
Transferred  Shares  shall  be  made  pursuant to an escrow agreement with China
Trust Securities.  China Trust shall be specifically instructed not to issue any
of  the  Purchaser  Price shares unless and until: (a) it has received the total
number  of  shares of Seller identified as the Initial Exchange, and (b) each of
the  individual shareholders submitting those shares have signed the Declaration
and Affidavit of Sale Pursuant to Rule 904 of Regulation S of The Securities Act
of  1933  attached  hereto.  The  Transferred Shares, when deliverable, shall be
delivered  by Escrow Agent to the offices of Cane O'Neill Taylor, LLC as counsel
for  Purchaser."


IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and
year  first  above  written.
