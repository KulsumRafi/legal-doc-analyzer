            All capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Loan and Security

referred to hereinafter each individually as a "Lender" and collectively as the
"Lenders"), FOOTHILL CAPITAL CORPORATION, a California corporation, as the
arranger and administrative agent for the Lenders ("Agent"), and, on the other
hand, HYPERCOM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and each of
Parent's Subsidiaries identified on the signature pages thereof (such
Subsidiaries are referred to hereinafter each individually as a "Borrower", and
individually and collectively, jointly and severally, as the "Borrowers"), dated

among Parent, the Borrowers and the Lender Group. The undersigned hereby (a)
represent and warrant to the Lender Group that the execution, delivery, and

California.
