Directors (&#147;HRC&#148;) that the Executive receive at least 100% of his bonus potential for such annual bonus period and at the discretion of management, up to 133% of his bonus potential. If the Executive&#146;s overall annual performance
rating for such annual bonus period is less than &#147;O,&#148; management of the Company will recommend to the HRC a bonus for Executive for the annual bonus period based upon the same bonus methodology used as that used to calculate the bonus
potential for other similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company. It is understood that the Executive may be paid at the Company&#146;s election up to 25% of his annual bonus in the form of an award of restricted stock, <U>provided however</U>,
such restriction is applied to similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company and with such awards to be made on the same terms as apply to other Vice Chairs of the Company. The Executive shall receive his bonus award for any year no later than other

have an aggregate net present value as of the date of award of $700,000 (or such greater amount as the Company may then deem appropriate based on a review to be conducted annually, prior to the date of award, beginning with the award to be made in
January 2004.) Each component of the annual long term incentive award is subject to the terms of the LTIP and the individualized agreement required. The LTIP and individualized agreements cover all aspects of the long-term incentive award. Vesting
