          as ELAN has vis-a-vis LIGAND pursuant to this Agreement.

          sub-licensee as though such acts and omissions were by LIGAND.

          EXCLUDED PATENTS into the PRODUCT, and (ii) the manufacture of the
          PRODUCT does not require the use of any EXCLUDED KNOW-HOW or EXCLUDED
          PATENTS. In addition, ELAN covenants that during the INITIAL PERIOD it
          shall not enter into any agreement restricting its ability to license
          in connection with the PRODUCT, or imposing third-party contractual
          obligations, on ELAN IMPROVEMENTS, without the prior written consent
          of LIGAND, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
          delayed.

          shall form part of the ELAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY licenced to LIGAND
          pursuant to CLAUSE 2.1.

3.2  FILING AND MAINTENANCE OF PATENTS:

     3.2.1 In the TERRITORY, LIGAND will be entitled but not obliged, at its own
          expense, to file and prosecute ELAN PATENTS, to determine the patent
          filing strategy in relation to same at its sole discretion and upon
          grant of any letters patent of the ELAN PATENTS, to maintain such
          letters patent in force.

     3.2.2 Should LIGAND elect not to file or not to continue the maintenance or
          prosecution of any case under the ELAN PATENTS in the TERRITORY, it
          shall notify ELAN of such decision. Upon ELAN's request and at ELAN's
          expense, LIGAND shall return control of the ELAN PATENT(S) that were
          the subject of the election to ELAN in a timely manner to allow ELAN
          to continue with the prosecution or maintenance of the ELAN PATENTS in
          the TERRITORY. Any case under the ELAN PATENTS in the TERRITORY that
          LIGAND chooses not to continue to maintain or prosecute will be
          removed from the license by ELAN to LIGAND under CLAUSE 2.1.

3.3  ENFORCEMENT:

     3.3.2 In the TERRITORY, LIGAND, at its option, shall be entitled to
          institute enforcement proceedings ("ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS") in
          respect of any infringement or unauthorised use of the ELAN
          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. ELAN agrees to provide all reasonable
          co-operation and assistance to LIGAND in relation to any such
          ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS (and agrees to be named as a party if legally
          required) at LIGAND's expense. Any reasonable fees and costs borne by
          ELAN shall be reimbursed by LIGAND. LIGAND shall be entitled to deduct
          its reasonable expenses in relation to such ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
          (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) from any recovery
          and any remaining amount shall be distributed pro rata among the
          parties in which LIGAND shall receive *** of any remaining recovery
          and ELAN shall receive *** of any remaining recovery. ELAN and LIGAND
          each recognise that it is in both parties interest to enforce ELAN
          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY to the full extent provided by law, and neither
          party shall, except as required by law, knowingly make any admission
          to jeopardise, compromise or otherwise limit the scope of such ELAN
          INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

     3.3.3 In the event that LIGAND does not want to institute, or to continue
          already instituted, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS in the TERRITORY, then
          ELAN, using attorneys of ELAN's choosing reasonably acceptable to
          LIGAND, can enforce such rights at its own expense. In such event,
          ELAN must keep LIGAND fully and timely informed of the action so as to
          enable LIGAND to provide input which ELAN shall reasonably consider.
          LIGAND agrees to provide all reasonable co-operation and assistance to
          ELAN in relation to any such ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS at ELAN's expense
          and agrees to be named as a party in any ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS. Any
          reasonable fees and costs borne by LIGAND shall be reimbursed by ELAN.
          In the event that ELAN enforces ELAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY in
          accordance with this paragraph, ELAN shall be entitled deduct its
          reasonable expenses in relation to such ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
          (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses and reimbursements
          to LIGAND) from any recovery and any remaining amount shall be
          distributed pro rata among the parties in which LIGAND shall receive
          *** of any remaining recovery and ELAN shall receive *** of any
          remaining recovery.

3.4  DEFENCE:

     3.4.1 LIGAND and ELAN shall promptly inform the other in writing of a claim
          or proceeding brought against either party by a third party alleging
          that the sale, manufacture, offer for sale or use of the PRODUCT
          infringes the patent rights of such a third party in the TERRITORY.
          The parties shall meet to discuss in what manner such claim or
          proceeding should be defended. Such discussion shall include, among
          other things, cessation of the manufacture and/or sale of the PRODUCT
          and modification of the PRODUCT to avoid unauthorised use.

     3.4.3. LIGAND shall defend such action at its expense including the
          reasonable expenses of ELAN (not including ELAN's attorney fees)
          incurred in cooperating with LIGAND in such defence. LIGAND shall
          indemnify and hold harmless ELAN against, and shall be obligated to
          pay, any award of damages to the third party under this CLAUSE 3.4,
          except that LIGAND shall not be obligated to indemnify ELAN against
          the multiple damages element of an award against ELAN for wilful
          infringement as a result of ELAN's

          omission or commission of an act without LIGAND's consent (which
          shall be deemed given in the event that ELAN seeks confirmation in
          writing pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in CLAUSE 16.12 as
          to whether it shouldproceed with an act or omission contemplated by
          this Agreement and LIGAND does not object within 7 (seven) business
          days of receipt of such request for confirmation), except as required
          by the terms of this Agreement (the "Multiple Damages Element") that
          would yield a ruling of wilful infringement (or, in the U.S., as
          otherwise provided in 35 U.S.C. ss. 284) or for any award of attorney
          fees (or, in the U.S., as otherwise provided in 35 U.S.C. ss. 285) to
          the third party against ELAN arising from such wilful infringement.
          LIGAND must keep ELAN fully and timely informed of each action
          (whether or not including a Multiple Damages Element), including
          offers of settlement made to or by LIGAND, so as to enable ELAN to
          provide input which LIGAND shall reasonably consider. LIGAND shall
          have the right to settle any claim against LIGAND based on such patent
          without ELAN's approval. LIGAND shall have the right to settle a claim
          against ELAN, (a) without ELAN's written approval, where such
          settlement contains no admission of liability on behalf of ELAN or (b)
          with ELAN's reasonable written approval, where such settlement
          contains any terms which are not wholly performed by LIGAND. Such
          determination of reasonableness shall be determined by the ATTORNEY.

     3.4.4 [Intentionally Omitted]

     3.4.5 ELAN shall have no liability to LIGAND whatsoever or howsoever
          arising for any losses incurred by LIGAND as a result of having to
          cease selling the PRODUCT or having to defer the launch of selling the
          PRODUCT, whether as a result of a court order or otherwise.

3.5  LIGAND agrees to pursue protection and use of the trademark AVINZA(TM)
     ("the MARK") only in the TERRITORY. After the AMENDMENT DATE, neither party
     shall be entitled to use the MARK outside of the TERRITORY; provided
     however LIGAND may use the MARK outside of the TERRITORY without the
     consent of ELAN if it has otherwise acquired rights to market the PRODUCT
     outside of the TERRITORY.

     parties agree that their present intention is that the terms shall so far
     as reasonably practicable be consistent with the development terms of the
     Prior Agreement and the financial and other terms of this Agreement, with
     such amendments as may be reasonably appropriate.

5.2  Additionally in the event that LIGAND wishes to have developed a product
     incorporating ELAN IMPROVEMENTS (other than the PRODUCT or further dosage
     strengths), the parties shall negotiate in good faith as to the additional
     development fees, additional licence fees, milestones, royalties and
     manufacturing costs associated with such a product, but so that royalties
     and manufacturing costs shall be comparable to those relating to the
     PRODUCT in the Prior Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, representatives of the parties (the
"PROJECT TEAM") shall meet at least semi-annually throughout the term of this
Agreement. The PROJECT TEAM shall meet at locations alternately designated by
the parties, or if agreed by telephonic or videoconference. Meetings shall be
co-chaired by the chief representatives of the parties. At and between meetings
of the PROJECT TEAM, each party shall keep the other fully and regularly
informed as to its progress with its respective obligations and regulatory
matters pertaining to the use of regulatory and clinical information in relation
to the PRODUCT inside and outside the TERRITORY. To the extent that LIGAND is
permitted to do so, LIGAND shall also keep ELAN generally informed at such
meetings as to LIGAND's commercial progress with the PRODUCT, including
performance against competitors and future objectives for the PRODUCT consistent
with the forecasts provided in CLAUSE 9.8.

     7.1.2 Effective as of AMENDMENT DATE and upon the terms of this Agreement,
          ELAN hereby sells, assigns, transfers and conveys to LIGAND, free and
          clear of all liens, encumbrances, pledge, security interest or other
          restriction or limitation of any kind, all of ELAN's right, title and
          interest in, to and under the following PRODUCT NDA registrations in
          the TERRITORY and shall formally transfer such ownership to LIGAND as
          soon as reasonably practicable after the AMENDMENT DATE, allowing
          opportunity to ELAN to file the DMF. To that end, ELAN will also
          provide LIGAND with copies of documentation, to the extent that ELAN
          has not already done so prior to the AMENDMENT DATE, to include:

                  (a) The NDA and any and all supplements, amendments and annual
         reports thereto and all clinical data, tables, listings and databases
         (as electronic SAS data sets) that are a part thereof, including grant
         of access to third party data managers for correspondence and
         documentation relating to the databases as well as changes, error
         corrections and other modifications to the databases (including hard or
         soft-coded changes); and

                  (b) Product registration data consisting of the following
         (including electronic copies where no hard copies exist) which are in
         ELAN's possession or control: regulatory correspondence files relating

         not limited to minutes of meetings and correspondence with the FDA, the
         investigational new drug applications and amendments, excluding or
         making appropriate redactions from any correspondence to the extent
         that it is specifically related to the CMC section.

         Such materials delivered shall, to the extent previously considered
         confidential, be considered confidential information of LIGAND subject
         to the provisions of CLAUSE 16.1; provided to the extent that such
         materials delivered contain confidential or proprietary information of
         ELAN, they shall also be considered confidential information of ELAN,
         subject to the provisions of CLAUSE 16.1, which ELAN may use solely in
         satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement or as permitted
         hereunder in connection with its activities outside the TERRITORY.

         For the avoidance of doubt, LIGAND shall thereafter be solely
         responsible for any legal or regulatory obligations pertaining to the
         ownership, filing and/or maintenance of the NDA including without
         limitation any tracking obligations, periodic reports to regulatory
         agencies, post market commitments, and commercialization commitments
         (in the form of a Risk Management Program).

         the above documents and shall notify ELAN forthwith of any and all
         amendments and supplements to the above. ELAN shall be entitled to make

         to permit ELAN to meet its obligations under this AGREEMENT, (ii) to
         permit ELAN to file and maintain the CMC SECTION in the DMF and (iii)
         to support the registration, marketing and/or manufacture of the
         PRODUCT for sale outside the TERRITORY.

         LIGAND and ELAN shall each allow the other full access to tclinical
         trial data related to the PRODUCT and each shall be permitted to use
         such data solely: (i) to permit such party to exercise its rights or
         meet its obligations under this AGREEMENT, or (ii) with respect to
         ELAN, to (A) permit it to file and maintain the CMC SECTION in the DMF

          provide to ELAN or its AFFILIATES for submission to applicable
          governmental or regulatory authorities, or provide to such applicable

          necessary authorization letters as may be reasonably required. Each
          party (the "Requesting Party") shall reimburse the other promptly for
          reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by such other party in
          complying with any such request by or on behalf of the Requesting

     importation, use and distribution of the COMPOUND in and into the countries
     of the TERRITORY, the parties acknowledge the requirement to order the

     of the COMPOUND to obtain the appropriate aggregate quota from the Drug
     Enforcement Agency in the U.S.A. or its successor agency, and its
     equivalent in Canada (where applicable). In this regard, the parties shall
     negotiate and agree upon a binding forecast for the supply of COMPOUND for
     the applicable calendar year (or part thereof). In the event that LIGAND
     does not order sufficient PRODUCT to utilise the quantity of COMPOUND,
     LIGAND shall ***. LIGAND further acknowledges that unutilised COMPOUND is
     likely materially to affect future quota allocations of that material, and
     ELAN's ability to acquire same for future orders.

9.7  ELAN shall deliver the PRODUCT to LIGAND within 120 days of the receipt of
     a firm purchase order properly placed therefor.

9.8  On or before the 23rd day of each calendar month, LIGAND shall provide a
     rolling 18 month-forecast for the period beginning on the first day of the
     relevant calendar month. The format of such 18 month-forecasts shall be
     comprised of a 12 month-forecast together with 2 quarterly forecasts. The

     ELAN with rolling 3 years' forecasts on 1 August of each year of this
     Agreement.

9.8A Within thirty (30) days of LIGAND providing ELAN with the rolling 3 years'
     forecast described in CLAUSE 9.8 above, the parties shall meet to discuss
     the latest rolling 18-month forecast and any capital expenditures specific
     to the manufacture of the PRODUCT required to meet any such forecast. In
     the event that the parties agree that such capital expenditures are
     required or desirable and such capital expenditures are in excess of ***,
     the parties shall negotiate a minimum number of batches of PRODUCT which
     LIGAND shall be obliged to order in calendar years after *** recognising
     the interest of ELAN in the recoupment of such expenditure. For purposes of
     determining the amount of such capital expenditures, the parties shall
     consider only the capital expenditures specific to the manufacture of the
     PRODUCT expended by ELAN from the AMENDMENT DATE through the date of such
     meeting and any additional amounts required thereafter to meet any such
     forecast.

9.9  Subject to the agreement of ELAN, the 12 month forecasts may increase or
     decrease from one quarter to the next, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, ELAN shall not be
     obligated to produce an amount of PRODUCT which differs by more than *** in
     terms of volume of PRODUCT ordered as compared to the preceding quarter.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, ELAN will use its reasonable efforts to
     fulfil LIGAND's requirements in excess of forecasted amounts, but shall not
     be obliged to meet such requirements if it is not reasonably practicable to
     do so provided that ELAN shall supply the PRODUCT so ordered but not
     immediately available as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.

9.10 Subject to CLAUSE 9.5, the parties shall agree upon a minimum order
     quantity for the manufacture and supply of each dosage strength the
     PRODUCT. ELAN shall have the right to refuse to fulfil orders which do not
     conform with the provisions of this CLAUSE 9.10. Where ELAN in its absolute
     discretion, fulfils any order which does not conform with the provisions of
     this CLAUSE 9.10, the fulfillment of such order by ELAN shall not affect
     ELAN's right to refuse to fulfil any subsequent order which does not
     conform with the provisions hereof.

9.10A ELAN shall reasonably co-operate with LIGAND, and shall use commercially
     reasonable efforts in good faith with a view to achieving sufficient quota
     of COMPOUND from the Drug Enforcement Agency in the U.S.A. or its successor
     agency, and/or its equivalent in Canada (where applicable) to meet the
     forecasted supply of the PRODUCT. Without prejudice to the foregoing
     obligation, ELAN shall not be obliged to fulfil orders where there is
     insufficient quota of COMPOUND to do so.

9.11 Save as otherwise agreed between the parties, delivery of consignments of
     PRODUCT shall be effected by ELAN EX-WORKS the manufacturing facility
     designated by ELAN. Risk of loss of or damage to any consignment of the
     PRODUCT shall pass to LIGAND when each such consignment of the PRODUCT is
     loaded onto the vehicle of LIGAND's agent on which it is to be despatched
     from the manufacturing facility designated by ELAN. LIGAND shall fully
     insure or procure the insurance of all consignments of the PRODUCT from the
     time when risk passes as aforesaid and shall produce the supporting
     insurance when requested by ELAN.

9.12 All claims for failure of any delivery of the PRODUCT to conform to the
     SPECIFICATIONS under CLAUSE 14 shall be made by LIGAND to ELAN in writing
     within 60 days following delivery except in the case of latent defects.
     Claims for latent defects, which could not reasonably have been discovered
     during the routine testing protocol (to be agreed by LIGAND and ELAN),
     shall be made by LIGAND to ELAN in writing within 30 days of discovery.
     Failure to make timely claims in the manner prescribed shall constitute
     acceptance of the delivery.

9.13 PRODUCT which has been delivered and which has been shown within the period
     designated in CLAUSE 9.12 not to conform to the SPECIFICATIONS where such
     non-conformity is attributable to negligent acts or omissions of ELAN shall
     be replaced at ELAN's cost within 90 days of the receipt by ELAN of the
     failed PRODUCT except where such non-conformity is attributable to
     negligent acts or omissions of LIGAND.

9.14 In the event of an unresolved dispute as to conformity of the PRODUCT with
     the SPECIFICATIONS, the parties shall within 30 days appoint an independent
     first class laboratory to undertake the relevant testing and its findings
     shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. All costs relating to
     this process shall be borne solely by the unsuccessful party. In the event
     that the parties should fail to agree a mutually acceptable independent
     laboratory within such 30 day period, the Head of the School of Pharmacy,
     Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland shall be entrusted with appointing such
     independent laboratory.

9.15 LIGAND shall have the option, at its sole cost and expense and subject to
     the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to qualify one or more
     second-source suppliers for the PRODUCT. Such second-source supplier shall
     be subject to the approval of ELAN, which shall not be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed, and subject to reasonable and customary undertakings
     from such second-source supplier to ELAN to protect ELAN's confidential and
     proprietary information. In addition, ELAN shall, effective as of the
     AMENDMENT DATE, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

     9.15.1 grant to LIGAND a production licence in the applicable country or
          countries of the TERRITORY so that LIGAND (and its second-source
          supplier(s)) may manufacture the relevant PRODUCT without infringing
          any of the ELAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Any such licence shall apply
          only in regard to the relevant PRODUCT as well as to the applications
          of technology derived from the ELAN PATENT RIGHTS related to its use
          with such PRODUCT;

     9.15.2 provide LIGAND (and its second-source supplier(s)) with any
          technical data incorporated in the ELAN KNOW-HOW, including but not
          limited to, access to the DMF, to give effect to the provisions of
          CLAUSE 9.15.1 and ELAN shall promptly provide to LIGAND (and its
          second-source supplier(s)) the documentation constituting the required
          material support, more particularly practical performance advice, shop
          practice, specifications as to materials to be used and control
          methods; and

     9.15.3 assist LIGAND (and its second source supplier(s)) with the working
          up and use of the technology and with the training of LIGAND's (and
          its second-source supplier(s)) personnel to the extent which may
          reasonably be necessary in relation to the manufacture of the PRODUCT
          by LIGAND (and its second-source supplier(s)). In this regard, ELAN
          will receive LIGAND's (and its second source supplier(s)'s) scientific
          staff in its premises for certain periods, the term of which will be
          agreed by the parties.



                                       20

         LIGAND shall pay for work conducted by ELAN or its AFFILIATES under
         CLAUSES 9.15.2 and/or 9.15.3 as agreed upon by the parties.

         LIGAND shall be solely responsible for filing all submissions or other
         correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory
         authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a
         second-source manufacturing facility for the PRODUCT ("Back-Up
         Facility") as an additional back-up manufacturing facility.

         Without prejudice to CLAUSE 9.5, LIGAND shall have the sole right to
         determine whether to use the Back-Up Facilities; provided that, subject
         to CLAUSES 9.16 and 10.3.5.2, such Back-Up Facilities may not supply
         more than (a) *** of LIGAND's and its permitted sublicensee(s)' annual
         requirements through the period of time ending 31 December 2007 and (b)
         *** of LIGAND's and its permitted sublicensee(s)' annual requirements
         thereafter during the term of this Agreement. In the event that LIGAND,
         and as applicable its permitted sublicensee(s), obtain more than the
         said amounts from Back-Up Facilities, then LIGAND shall pay to ELAN an
         additional royalty equivalent to *** of AVERAGE PRICE (calculated by
         reference to that calendar year) of the additional quantities of
         PRODUCT taken from such Back-Up Facilities, over and above the maxima
         referred to in this paragraph. The foregoing shall constitute ELAN's
         sole remedies in respect of a failure by LIGAND to comply with its
         limitations on amount obtained from Back-Up Facilities set forth in
         this CLAUSE 9.15 (but without prejudice to any remedy ELAN may have for
         any other breach by LIGAND).

9.16 In the event that ELAN fails to deliver to LIGAND a significant portion of
     an order of PRODUCT for a period exceeding *** from the due delivery date
     therefor, or there are repeated and serious failures, inability or delays
     in filling orders, LIGAND may for so long as such conditions exist fulfil
     all of its unmet requirements from the Back-Up Facilities. Additionally,
     for so long as such conditions exist, the royalty payable by LIGAND under
     CLAUSE 10.2 shall be reduced to *** of NSP for such unmet requirements
     attributable to ELAN's default (and for the avoidance of doubt such
     failure, inability or delays caused by the supplier of the COMPOUND (other
     than by reason of ELAN's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts) or
     due to the applicable governmental imposed quota system for the COMPOUND
     (other than by reason of ELAN's breach of its obligations in CLAUSE 9.10A)
     shall not be considered ELAN's default).

         The foregoing shall constitute LIGAND's sole remedies in respect of a
         failure by ELAN to supply the PRODUCT.

9.16A When ELAN has remedied the cause of its failure to satisfy LIGAND's
     requirements and is once again able to fulfil its obligations to supply the
     PRODUCT, LIGAND's entitlement to obtain supplies of the PRODUCT from its
     Back-Up Facilities shall revert to the level set out in CLAUSE 9.15, and
     the royalty payable by LIGAND under CLAUSE 10.2 shall revert to *** of NSP.

9.17 In manufacturing the PRODUCT under CLAUSE 9.15, LIGAND shall be responsible
     for all process and equipment validation required by the FDA and the
     regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
     pass government inspection by the FDA.

9.18 ***

9.19 ELAN will grant to Elan Pharma Ltd., Elan Holdings, Inc. or any other
     subsidiaries of ELAN, as necessary or appropriate, a licence of the ELAN
     PATENTS and ELAN KNOW-HOW and other intellectual property rights necessary
     for such company or companies to manufacture the PRODUCT in accordance with
     the terms of this Agreement.

                    (b) *** *** to EML.



                  Each such payment shall be effected in U.S. Dollars upon the
                  AMENDMENT DATE. The said patent royalty shall not be subject
                  to future performance obligations, shall not be applicable
                  against any future services provided by ELAN and/or EML to
                  LIGAND and is independent and distinct from the other terms of
                  this Agreement.

         For the avoidance of doubt, subject to CLAUSES 9.15 and 9.16, the said
         royalty shall apply both to PRODUCT manufactured by ELAN and PRODUCT
         manufactured by LIGAND or a second-source supplier.

10.3 PRICE OF PRODUCT:

     10.3.1 Subject to CLAUSES 10.3.2 and 10.3.3, the unit price of the PRODUCT
          to be charged by ELAN to LIGAND for commercial sale shall be *** of
          AVERAGE PRICE per strength, payable in $ as follows:

          10.3.1.1 ELAN shall initially invoice PRODUCT supplied at *** of
               AVERAGE PRICE as shown by the last STATEMENT, and payment shall
               be made by LIGAND within 30 days of such invoice;

          10.3.1.2 Following delivery of the STATEMENT pertaining to a calendar
               quarter, the unit price of PRODUCT supplied in that calendar
               quarter shall be readjusted to *** of actual AVERAGE PRICE in
               that calendar quarter. An adjusting payment shall accordingly be
               made by LIGAND to ELAN with the STATEMENT, or by ELAN to LIGAND
               within 5 (five) business days following delivery of the
               STATEMENT.

          The said price shall apply to PRODUCT supplied EX WORKS ELAN's
facility to LIGAND.

     10.3.2 In the event that:

          10.3.2.1 during the period up to 31 December 2005 ELAN's aggregate
               cost of ***, in each case used in the PRODUCT increases by
               reference to such costs as at October 2002 by more than ***;
               and/or

          10.3.2.2 LIGAND fails to meet its minimum order requirements specified
               in CLAUSE 9.5; and/or

          10.3.2.3 at any time, LIGAND requests any change to SPECIFICATIONS or
               the form in which the PRODUCT is supplied as at October 2002, or
               such a change is mandated by the FDA or other legal or regulatory
               authority in the TERRITORY -

                  which results in *** , the parties shall negotiate in good
                  faith adjustments to the price of PRODUCT, having regard only
                  to those costs in excess of the *** increase described in
                  CLAUSE 10.3.2.1 and the matters set out in CLAUSES 10.3.2.2
                  and 10.3.2.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties have set
                  forth an example of the calculation described in this CLAUSE
                  10.3.2 in Schedule 2 attached hereto.

               10.3.3.2 LIGAND requests ELAN to supply promotional samples of
                    the PRODUCT -

                  the price of such PRODUCT shall be the price of PRODUCT
                  specified in CLAUSE 10.3.1, as adjusted pursuant to CLAUSE
                  10.3.2 if applicable, plus an additional amount equivalent to
                  the incremental cost after the AMENDMENT DATE to ELAN of
                  supplying such PRODUCT.

     10.3.4 In the event that during the period after 31 December 2005 any of
          the conditions set forth in CLAUSES 10.3.2.1 and/or 10.3.2.3 exist
          and/or LIGAND fails to place firm orders for at least *** whole
          batches of the PRODUCT per calendar year (consisting of the various
          possible multiples as described in CLAUSE 9.5), and ELAN's FULLY
          ALLOCATED COST of manufacture exceeds *** of the AVERAGE PRICE, the
          price of PRODUCT shall be adjusted so that it shall equal ***
          provided that in the event that such *** exceeds the price charged for
          the PRODUCT by LIGAND's second source supplier(s) (as evidenced to

          at ELAN's option:

          10.3.5.1 the price of the PRODUCT shall instead be *** of *** ; or

          10.3.5.2 LIGAND shall be released from the limitation upon the
               quantity of PRODUCT which may be supplied by Back-Up Facilities
               as set out in CLAUSE 9.15; and the price of any PRODUCT supplied
               by ELAN to LIGAND thereafter shall be *** .

     10.3.6 All prices for the PRODUCT are exclusive of any applicable value
          added or any other sales tax, for which LIGAND will be additionally

     10.3.7 [Intentionally Omitted]

     10.3.8 For the avoidance of doubt the parties agree that if for whatever
          reason the PRODUCT supplied by ELAN to LIGAND is not sold by LIGAND,
          payment to ELAN for such PRODUCT shall nonetheless be effected at the
          price calculated in accordance with CLAUSES 10.3.1 to 10.3.3
          inclusive.

10.4 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS:

         In respect of PRODUCT sold IN MARKET prior to the AMENDMENT DATE (the

         effect that:

     10.4.1 LIGAND shall pay to ELAN the FLOOR PRICE (as defined in the Prior
          Agreement) of TRANSITIONAL PRODUCT; and

     10.4.2 LIGAND shall pay to ELAN the amount specified in CLAUSE 10.3.4 of
          the Prior Agreement in respect of TRANSITIONAL PRODUCT.

         In respect of PRODUCT supplied to LIGAND prior to the AMENDMENT DATE
         but not sold IN MARKET prior to the AMENDMENT DATE, LIGAND shall pay to
         ELAN the FLOOR PRICE (as defined in the Prior Agreement) as if the
         Prior Agreement applied, but the IN MARKET sales of such PRODUCT shall
         be subject to the royalty provisions of this Agreement and not to
         CLAUSE 10.3.4 of the Prior Agreement.

10.5 METHOD OF CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL PROVISIONS:

         The parties acknowledge and agree that the methods for calculating the
         royalties and other payments hereunder are for the purposes of the
         convenience of the parties, are freely chosen and not coerced.

     in the first or last calendar quarter of this Agreement) for such calendar
     quarter. The STATEMENT shall outline on a country-by-country basis, the
     calculation of the NSP from gross revenues during that calendar quarter,
     the applicable percentage rate, and a computation of the sums due to ELAN.
     The parties' financial officers shall agree upon the precise format of the
     STATEMENT.

11.2 Payments due on NSP of the PRODUCT based on sales amounts in a currency
     other than US Dollars shall first be calculated in the foreign currency and
     then converted to US Dollars on the basis of the exchange rate in effect
     for the purchase of US Dollars with such foreign currency quoted in the
     Wall Street Journal (or comparable publication if not quoted in the Wall
     Street Journal) with respect to the sale of currency of the country of
     origin of such payment for the day prior to the date on which the payment
     by LIGAND is being made.

     withhold on behalf of ELAN or EML, as the case may be, with respect to
     royalties and any other monies payable to ELAN under this Agreement shall
     be deducted from the amount of such NSP payments, royalties and other

     of and borne solely by ELAN and/or EML. LIGAND shall promptly provide ELAN
     and/or EML with a certificate or other documentary evidence to enable ELAN
     and/or EML to support a claim for a refund or a foreign tax credit with

     reasonably cooperate in completing and filing documents required under the
     provisions of any applicable tax treaty or under any other applicable law,
     in order to enable LIGAND to make such payments to ELAN and/or EML without
     any deduction or withholding.

11.4 All payments due hereunder shall be made to the designated bank account of
     ELAN or EML, as the case may be, in accordance with such timely written

     business day) on which payment should have been made pursuant to the
     applicable provisions of this Agreement plus 5% on all late payments more
     than 10 days past due under this Agreement applicable from the date on
     which payment should have been made pursuant to the applicable provisions

11.7 For the 180 day period following the close of each calendar year of the
     Agreement, ELAN and LIGAND will, in the event that the other party
     reasonably requests such access, provide each other's independent certified
     accountants (reasonably acceptable to the other party) with access, during
     regular business hours and subject to the confidentiality provisions as
     contained in this Agreement, to such party's books and records relating to
     the PRODUCT, solely for the purpose of verifying the accuracy and
     reasonable composition of the calculations hereunder for the calendar year
     then ended.

11.7A Additionally LIGAND shall upon request provide ELAN or, at LIGAND's
     option, an independent third party nominated by ELAN and reasonably
     acceptable to LIGAND with access, during regular business hours and subject
     to the confidentiality provisions as contained in this Agreement, to
     LIGAND's and any second-source manufacturer's books and records relating to
     the manufacture of the PRODUCT, solely for the purpose of verifying
     LIGAND's compliance with the maximum amounts of supply from Back-Up
     Facilities set out in CLAUSE 9.15. Such inspections shall be made not more
     than once per year unless such an inspection discloses non-compliance and
     thereafter shall continue until the previously disclosed non-compliance is
     satisfactorily resolved.

11.8 In the event of a discovery of a discrepancy which exceeds 5% of the amount
     due or charged by a party for any period, or a failure to comply with the
     maximum limits on supply from Back-Up Facilities set out in CLAUSE 9.15,
     the cost of such accountants shall be borne by the audited party;
     otherwise, such cost shall be borne by the auditing party.

11.9 ELAN shall make (and where relevant shall procure that ELAN's
     subcontractor, assignee or designee shall make) that portion of its
     manufacturing, testing or storage facility where PRODUCT is manufactured,
     tested or stored, including all record and reference samples relating to
     the PRODUCT available for inspection by LIGAND's duly qualified person or
     by the relevant governmental or regulatory authority. The investigation
     shall be limited to determining whether there is compliance with cGMP and
     with other requirements of applicable law. Such inspection shall be made
     not more than once per year, unless based on a for cause requirement.

                      CLAUSE 12 - DURATION AND TERMINATION

12.1 This Agreement shall be deemed to have come into force on the EFFECTIVE
     DATE and, subject to the rights of termination outlined in this CLAUSE 12
     will expire on a country by country basis:

     12.1.1 on the *** date of the launch of the PRODUCT in the country
          concerned; or

     12.1.2 in any country upon the expiration of the life of the last to expire
          patent included in the ELAN PATENTS in that country;

         whichever date is later to occur ("the INITIAL PERIOD").

12.2 [Intentionally Omitted]

12.3 In addition to the rights of termination provided for elsewhere in this
     Agreement, either party will be entitled forthwith to terminate this
     Agreement by written notice to the other party if:

     12.3.1 subject to CLAUSE 12.3A, that other party commits any material
          breach of this Agreement, and (A) in the case of a breach capable of
          cure, fails to cure the same within 60 days after receipt of a written
          notice giving full particulars of the breach and requiring it to be
          remedied or (B) in the case of a breach not capable of cure, the
          non-breaching party has a remedy at law;

     12.3.2 that other party goes into liquidation (except for the purposes of
          amalgamation or reconstruction and in such manner that the company
          resulting therefrom effectively agrees to be bound by or assume the
          obligations imposed on that other party under this Agreement);

     12.3.3 an encumbrancer takes possession or a receiver is appointed over any
          of the property or assets of that other party;

     12.3.4 any proceedings are filed or commenced by that other party under
          bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor relief laws or anything analogous to
          any of the foregoing under the laws of any jurisdiction occurs in
          relation to that other party, and such proceeding is not dismissed
          within ninety (90) days;

12.3A Where the party in breach is LIGAND, ELAN shall not terminate this
     Agreement unless and until such breach by LIGAND is admitted or determined
     by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that LIGAND complies with
     the following conditions:

     12.3A.1 within seven (7) days of ELAN giving notice to LIGAND of ELAN's
          intention to terminate, LIGAND shall place all monies allegedly owing
          to ELAN pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (as specified in the
          notice) in an escrow account with such US attorneys firm as ELAN may
          nominate ("Escrow Account"), on terms that it shall be released to
          ELAN upon admission or determination of breach by a court of competent
          jurisdiction, and other reasonable and customary terms;

     12.3A.2 ELAN shall not be obliged to supply PRODUCT unless payment for the
          same is made in advance; such payment at LIGAND's option being made to
          the Escrow Account but on terms that it shall be released as soon as
          such payment would have fallen due, but for this CLAUSE 12.3A; and

     12.3A.3 any PRODUCT supplied during such period shall be subject to a
          minimum price of ELAN's ***; pursuant thereto, LIGAND shall
          additionally remit to the Escrow Account the amount specified by ELAN
          in good faith as the excess of such *** over the supply price set
          forth in CLAUSE 10.3. For the purposes of clarity, in the event that
          it is admitted by ELAN or finally determined by a court of competent
          jurisdiction that LIGAND was not in breach, the monies paid into the
          Escrow Account pursuant to this Clause 12.3A.3 shall be repaid to
          LIGAND.

         For the avoidance of doubt, ELAN shall be entitled to terminate this
         Agreement in the event that the foregoing conditions are not complied
         with.

         The foregoing shall be without prejudice to (a) any right ELAN may have
         to terminate supply pursuant to CLAUSE 9.18, and (b) ELAN's right to
         terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clauses 12.3.2, 12.3.3 and/or
         12.3.4.

12.4 For the purposes of CLAUSE 12.3.1, a breach will be considered capable of
     remedy if the party in breach can comply with the provision in question in
     all respects other than as to the time of performance (provided that time
     of performance is not of the essence).

     Agreement, or (ii) if not delivered under (i) above, upon the rejection of
     this Agreement by or on behalf of the party subject to such proceeding upon
     written request therefore by the non-subject party.

          by LIGAND pursuant to CLAUSE 2.1.2 shall survive termination and
          continue according to its terms, provided that (a) such sub-license
          was granted in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement, (b) all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement
          shall apply to such sub-license and the sub-licensee thereunder as

16.1 SECRECY:

     16.1.1 Any information, whether written or oral (oral information shall be
          reduced to writing within one month by the party giving the oral

          that such confidential information shall not be subject to the
          restrictions and prohibitions set forth herein to the extent that such
          confidential information:

                  (1)      is available to the public in public literature or
                           otherwise, or after disclosure by one party to the

                           the party receiving such confidential information; or

                  (2)      was known to the party receiving such confidential

                           after the EFFECTIVE DATE; or

                  (3)      is obtained by the party receiving such confidential
                           information from a third party not subject to a

                           confidential information; or

                  (4)      is required to be disclosed pursuant to: (A) any
                           order of a court having jurisdiction and power to
                           order such information to be released or made public;
                           or (B) any lawful action of a governmental or
                           regulatory agency provided that each party shall
                           notify the other in writing of any disclosure of
                           information required hereunder prior to such
                           disclosure and shall use all reasonable efforts to
                           restrict the scope of disclosure, including without
                           limitation by agreeing to appropriate redactions
                           and/or making requests for confidential treatment.

     16.1.2 Each party shall take in relation to the confidential information of
          the other party all such precautions as it normally takes with its own
          confidential information to prevent any improper disclosure of such
          confidential information to any third party; provided, however, that
          such confidential information may be disclosed within the limits
          required to obtain or maintain any authorisation from the applicable
          FDA or any governmental or regulatory agency or, with the prior
          written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
          withheld, or as may otherwise be required in connection with the
          purposes of this Agreement.

     16.1.3 LIGAND agrees that it will not use, directly or indirectly, any ELAN
          KNOW-HOW, or other confidential information disclosed to it by ELAN or
          obtained by it from ELAN pursuant to this Agreement, other than as
          expressly provided herein.

     16.1.4 Neither party will publicise the existence of this Agreement in any
          way without the prior written consent of the other party subject to
          the disclosure requirements of applicable laws and regulations. In the
          event that either party wishes to make an announcement concerning the
          Agreement, that party will seek the consent of the other party. The
          terms of any such announcement shall be agreed in good faith.

     16.1.5 At the request of a party in writing, the other party shall not
          disseminate any public announcement for a period of sixty (60) days
          from the receipt of such request regarding this Agreement or the
          transactions contemplated hereby or regarding such requesting party,
          without such requesting party's consent, which shall not be
          unreasonably withheld, provided, however, a party may disseminate a
          public announcement regarding the foregoing if such party obtains an
          opinion of independent counsel that such party is obligated by law to
          disseminate such information to the public.

16.2 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE:

         Each of ELAN and LIGAND acknowledges and agrees that in the event
         either party materially breaches any obligations under this Agreement
         which can be specifically performed, the aggrieved party shall be
         entitled to seek specific performance of this Agreement and to enjoin
         any continuing breach of this Agreement (without the necessity of
         proving actual damages and without posting bond or other security), in
         addition to any other remedy which such aggrieved party may be entitled
         to at law or in equity and each of ELAN and LIGAND will waive the
         defence in any action for specific performance or other equitable
         relief that a remedy at law would be adequate or that the services
         provided hereunder are personal in nature.

16.3 ASSIGNMENTS/SUB-CONTRACTING:

Neither party shall be permitted to assign or sub-licence any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other;
provided that:

     16.3.1 ELAN and LIGAND may assign its rights or obligations under this
          Agreement to an AFFILIATE without such consent provided that such
          assignment has no adverse tax implications for the other party and
          provided further that such assigning party is not relieved of its
          obligations hereunder;



                                       36

<PAGE>

     16.3.2 LIGAND may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
          Agreement without the prior written consent of ELAN to a person that
          acquires all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of
          LIGAND, provided that such assignment has no adverse tax implications
          for ELAN under this Agreement;

     16.3.3 ELAN may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
          Agreement insofar as they pertain to the PRODUCT outside the TERRITORY
          (including without limitation its rights under CLAUSE 7.2), provided
          that such assignment has no adverse tax implications for LIGAND under
          this Agreement;

     16.3.4 ELAN shall transfer or assign all (but not a portion) of its other
          rights and obligations under this Agreement to a person that acquires
          all right, title and interest in, to and under the PRODUCT
          manufacturing facility and related manufacturing assets provided that
          such assignment has no adverse tax implications for LIGAND under this
          Agreement; and PROVIDED that following such transfer or assignment
          ELAN may solely retain any rights pursuant to CLAUSE 10.2, without the
          prior written consent of LIGAND; and

     16.3.5 ELAN shall have the right to subcontract all or any portion of the
          manufacturing as provided in CLAUSE 9.4 and/or to subcontract the
          packaging of the PRODUCT to one or more third parties but shall be
          responsible for the acts and/or omissions of such subcontractors.

16.4 PARTIES BOUND:

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure for the benefit of
         parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns.

16.5 SEVERABILITY:

         If any provision in this Agreement is agreed by the parties to be, or
         is deemed to be, or becomes invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable
         under any law that is applicable hereto:

     16.5.1 such provision will be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws
          so as to be valid and enforceable or, if it cannot be so amended
          without materially altering the intention of the parties, it will be
          deleted, with effect from the date of such agreement or such earlier
          date as the parties may agree; and

     16.5.2 the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
          provisions of this Agreement shall not be impaired or affected in any
          way.

16.6 FORCE MAJEURE:

         Neither party to this Agreement shall be liable for delay in the
         performance of any of its obligations hereunder if such delay results
         from causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without
         limitation, acts of God, fires, strikes, acts of war, or intervention
         of a government authority, non-availability of raw materials, but any
         such delay or failure shall be remedied by such party as soon as
         practicable.

16.7 RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES:

         Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed
         to constitute ELAN and LIGAND as partners or members of a joint venture
         or either party as an employee of the other. Neither party hereto shall
         have any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any
         obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind
         the other party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any
         third party.

16.8 AMENDMENTS:

         No amendment, modification or addition hereto shall be effective or
         binding on either party unless set forth in writing and executed by a
         duly authorised representative of both parties.

16.9 WAIVER:

         No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be deemed effective
         unless contained in a written document signed by the party charged with
         such waiver, and no waiver of any breach or failure to perform shall be
         deemed to be a waiver of any future breach or failure to perform or of
         any other right arising under this Agreement.

16.10 NO EFFECT ON OTHER AGREEMENTS:

         This Agreement supersedes that certain Letter of Intent dated September
         28, 1998 between the parties as such Letter of Intent relates to the
         subject matter hereof, and the Prior Agreement, but without prejudice
         to CLAUSE 10.4 hereof or to any accrued rights or obligations of the
         parties as at the AMENDMENT DATE. For the avoidance of doubt, rights
         and obligations in connection with (i) representations and warranties
         given by the parties under the Prior Agreement (whether at the
         EFFECTIVE DATE or otherwise) or (ii) covenants to be performed by a
         party from the EFFECTIVE DATE through the AMENDMENT DATE under the
         Prior Agreement shall be unaffected by this amendment and restatement
         of the Prior Agreement. Except as limited by the foregoing sentences,
         no provision of this Agreement shall be construed so as to negate,
         modify or affect in any way the provisions of any other agreement
         between the parties unless specifically referred to, and solely to the
         extent provided, in any such other agreement. There are no agreements
         or understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof, either
         oral or written, between the parties other than as set forth in this
         Agreement.

16.10A FURTHER ASSURANCE:

         At the request of any of the parties, each other party shall (and shall
         use reasonable efforts to procure that any other necessary persons
         shall) execute and perform all such documents, acts and things as may
         reasonably be required subsequent to the execution of this Agreement
         for assuring to or vesting in the requesting party the full benefit of
         the terms hereof.
