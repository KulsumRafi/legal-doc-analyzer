the Excepted Liens, the Company owns, in all material respects, the net interests in production attributable to the Hydrocarbon Interests that are evaluated in the most recently delivered reserve

each such Hydrocarbon Interest in an amount in excess of the working interest of such Hydrocarbon Interest (without a corresponding increase in net revenue interest). The Company does not believe,
based upon information in its possession, that its most recently delivered reserve report materially overstates its oil and gas reserves, bearing in mind that reserves are evaluated based upon
estimates and assumptions with respect to which reasonable minds of competent reserve engineers may differ. </FONT></P>
