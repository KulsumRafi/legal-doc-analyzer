         Credit Agreement in any Loan Document shall be deemed to refer to this
         Amendment also. Any reference to the Note in any other Loan Document
         shall be deemed to be a reference to the Renewal Note issued and
         delivered pursuant to this Amendment. The execution, delivery and
         effectiveness of this Amendment, the other Amendment Documents, shall
         not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any
         right, power or remedy of Lender under the Credit Agreement or any
         other Loan Document nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the
         Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         ss. 5.2. Survival of Agreements. All representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of Borrowers herein shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Amendment and the performance hereof, and shall further survive
until all of the Obligations are paid in full. All statements and agreements
contained in any certificate or instrument delivered by Borrowers hereunder or
under the Credit Agreement to Lender shall be deemed to constitute
representations and warranties by, or agreements and covenants of, Borrowers
under this Amendment and under the Credit Agreement.

each of which when so executed shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
Amendment. This Amendment may be duly executed by facsimile or other electronic
