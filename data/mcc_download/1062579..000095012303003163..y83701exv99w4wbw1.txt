                  SCHEDULE E.3 and those applicable to specific SBC Sites, all
                  as have been provided to Amdocs in writing (collectively, "SBC
                  RULES"). The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the
                  Commencement Date, SBC has fully informed Amdocs as to the SBC

                  Personnel shall observe and comply with such additional or
                  modified SBC Rules. To the extent that any such additions or

                  performing the Services or Amdocs' responsibilities hereunder,
                  the Parties will address such impact through the provisions

                  shall familiarize themselves with the premises and operations
                  at each SBC Site at or from which Services are rendered and

                  request, SBC shall provide Amdocs with the Material Safety
                  Data Sheets (MSDSs) for any hazardous chemical, as that term
                  is defined under the Occupational Health and Safety Act
                  (OSHA), present at any SBC Site. Amdocs is hereby notified
                  that SBC Sites constructed prior to 1981 contain asbestos
                  containing materials (ACM) and/or presumed ACM (PACM) and may
                  also contain both natural and artificial conditions and
                  activities involving risk of harm.

                  ninety (90) days notice of the expiration of any collective
                  bargaining agreement with unionized Amdocs Personnel if the
                  expiration of such agreement or any resulting labor dispute
                  could potentially interfere with or disrupt the business or
                  operations of SBC or an Eligible Recipient or impact Amdocs'
                  ability to timely perform its duties and obligations under
                  this Agreement.

         (b)      WARN ACT COMMITMENT. Amdocs shall not cause any of the
                  Transitioned Employees to suffer "employment loss" as that
                  term is construed under the WARN Act, if such employment loss
                  could create any liability under the WARN Act for SBC, the
                  Eligible Recipients, or its or their Affiliates, unless Amdocs
                  delivers notices under the WARN Act in a manner and at a time
                  such that SBC, the Eligible Recipients, or its or their
                  Affiliates bear no liability with respect thereto.

         (c)      RESPONSIBILITY. Amdocs shall be responsible for any liability,
                  cost, claim, expense, obligation or sanction attributable to
                  any breach by Amdocs of SECTION 8.12(b) that results in SBC or
                  the Eligible Recipients being in violation of the WARN Act or
                  the regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing in this
                  provision shall diminish Amdocs' obligation pursuant to
                  SECTION 8.1(d).

                  requirements set forth in SCHEDULE E, PART 6. At a minimum,
                  the Policy and Procedures Manual shall include the following:

                  (i)      the procedures for SBC/Amdocs interaction and

                  reasonable comments or suggestions of SBC into the Policy and
                  Procedures Manual and shall deliver a final revised version to
                  SBC [**] of its receipt of such comments and suggestions for
                  SBC's approval. The Policy and Procedures Manual will be
                  delivered and maintained by Amdocs in hard copy and electronic

         (c)      COMPLIANCE. Amdocs shall perform the Services in accordance

                  such agreement is set forth in the relevant portion of the
                  Policy and Procedures Manual. To the extent that future
                  additions or modifications to the Policy and Procedures Manual
                  materially increase Amdocs' aggregate costs of performance of

         (c)      MATERIALS QUALITY. Amdocs hereby agrees that Materials
                  furnished hereunder by Amdocs have or will have undergone or
                  have or will have been subject to appropriate quality control
                  measures and procedures, including performance measurements,
                  testing, quality process reviews or inspections prior to
                  delivery to SBC.

         (d)      SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE PROGRAM. Both Parties hereby agree to
                  participate in the Supplier Performance Program (hereinafter
                  "PROGRAM") described below. The Program is a program to assist
                  Amdocs in self-identifying areas of deficiency that may
                  develop in Amdocs' performance as it relates to fulfilling its
                  obligations under this Agreement. Participation in or use of,
                  the Program does not negate or diminish Amdocs'
                  responsibilities as it relates to its requirements to perform
                  its obligation as defined elsewhere in this Agreement nor does
                  it negate, diminish or waive SBC's rights or remedies as
                  defined elsewhere in this Agreement. If there is a conflict
                  between the Program and other sections of this Agreement the
                  other sections of this Agreement shall control. The Parties
                  intent is that documentation requirements under the Program
                  will be satisfied by other documentation obligations provided
                  for elsewhere in this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties do
                  not anticipate that compliance with the Program will impose
                  upon Amdocs obligations above that otherwise provided for in
                  this Agreement.

                  Amdocs shall:

                  (i)      Monitor its performance relative to certain
                           measurable performance indices such as product
                           performance, service performance, and on time
                           delivery. Performance measurements collected for the
                           purposes of the Program (hereinafter "Data") will be
                           defined by SBC and communicated to Amdocs from time
                           to time.

                  (ii)     Collect and report to SBC the data relating to
                           Amdocs' performance. The data must be entered by
                           Amdocs in SBC's Amdocs Website (currently
                           www.sbcsuppliers.com) in a format that is designated
                           by SBC. Data will be collected and reported
                           periodically.

                  (iii)    Conduct a self-evaluation of its performance based on
                           the analysis of the data reported. In those areas
                           where Amdocs' performance deviates from [**], Amdocs
                           shall [**]

                  (iv)     Cooperate fully with SBC's supplier performance
                           management team to coordinate Amdocs' activities as
                           they relate to the Program. This includes but is not
                           limited to participation in planning meetings,
                           audits, feedback sessions, and issue resolution.

                  SBC shall:

                           provide Amdocs with periodic feedback evaluating its
                           performance. SBC's supplier performance management

                           issues that may impact Amdocs' performance.

                  respect to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the
                  Services, including bringing to SBC's attention any existing
                  or planned promotional offerings of Amdocs, Service upgrades
                  or additional services that Amdocs believes may be of value to

                  reconfigurations that optimize delivery of Services to Amdocs
                  efficiently and eliminate unwanted redundancy.

         (f)      SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing contained in this SECTION 9.3 will
                  diminish Amdocs' obligation to deliver Materials in
                  conformance to Amdocs' warranty obligations under this
                  Agreement.

9.4      [**] STRATEGIC DECISIONS AND AUTHORITY.

                           (ii) Amdocs locations that are not related to SBC or
                           the Services, or (iii) Amdocs' internal costs and
                           expenses, [**]

                  (ii)     In performing audits, SBC shall endeavor to avoid
                           unnecessary disruption of Amdocs' operations and
                           unnecessary interference with Amdocs' ability to
                           perform the Services in accordance with the Service
                           Levels.

                  (iii)    Prior to being granted access, external parties shall
                           first enter into a non-disclosure agreement with
                           Amdocs, in form substantially as set forth in EXHIBIT
                           6.

                  (iv)     Following any audit, SBC shall conduct (in the case
                           of an internal audit), or request its external
                           auditors or examiners to conduct, an exit conference
                           with Amdocs to obtain factual concurrence with issues
                           identified in the review.

                  (v)      SBC shall provide Amdocs with advanced notice [**]
                           prior to any operational or financial audit by SBC or
                           its authorized agents or representatives. SBC shall
                           be given adequate private workspace in which to
                           perform an audit, plus reasonable access to
                           photocopiers, telephones, facsimile machines,
                           computer hook-ups, and any other facilities or

                           SBC will not undertake audits [**], unless SBC has
                           reasonable grounds to believe that Amdocs is not in
                           compliance with this Agreement, including improper
                           invoicing of SBC, or SBC is otherwise required to
                           undertake such audit.

         (f)      AMDOCS INTERNAL AUDIT. If Amdocs determines as a result of its
                  own internal audit that it has overcharged SBC, then Amdocs
                  shall promptly pay to SBC the amount of such overcharge,
                  together with interest from the date of Amdocs' receipt of
                  such overcharge at the Prime Rate. In the event such an audit
                  results in a determination that Amdocs has undercharged SBC,
                  then, subject to SBC's right

                  to dispute the amount of such undercharge, Amdocs shall
                  immediately report such undercharge to SBC and the amount of
                  such undercharge shall be treated, for invoicing and payment
                  purposes, as a credit in arrears for the month in which the
                  undercharge is discovered or in the month in which the final
                  resolution occurs.

         (g)      AMDOCS RESPONSE. Amdocs and SBC shall meet to review each

                  that Amdocs is not in compliance with any generally accepted
                  accounting principle or other audit requirement or any rule,
                  regulation or law relating to the performance of its
                  obligations under this Agreement, Amdocs shall, [**] and

                  Contracts, Equipment Leases or Third Party Software licenses
                  as to which Amdocs is financially responsible, but which have

         (d)      NOTICE OF DECOMMISSIONING. Amdocs agrees to notify SBC
                  promptly if and to the extent SBC owned Equipment or SBC
                  leased Equipment will no longer be used to provide the

                  the Equipment, and the date it will no longer be needed by
                  Amdocs, along with the reason for decommissioning. Upon

                  terminate the Equipment lease for such leased Equipment as of

                  to make such leased Equipment available to Amdocs, if
                  earlier), Amdocs shall return the same to SBC in condition at
                  least as good as the condition thereof on the Commencement
                  Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Amdocs shall, [**]C.

                  that are not exclusively dedicated to SBC and that do not
                  include regular direct contact with SBC or Eligible Recipient
                  personnel or the performance of services at SBC Sites or (ii)
                  with temporary personnel firms for the provision of temporary

                  skilled and professional manner. SBC shall have no approval
                  right with respect to such Shared Subcontractors. If, however,
                  SBC expresses dissatisfaction with the services of a Shared
                  Subcontractor, Amdocs shall work in good faith to resolve

                  constitute "COMMERCIAL ITEMS" as that term is defined in the
                  Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. Section 52.202, and
                  that subcontractors providing commercial items under
                  government contracts are subject to certain mandatory
                  flow-down clauses (currently, (i) Equal Opportunity, (ii)
                  Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era
                  Veterans, and (iii) Affirmative Action for Handicapped
                  Workers) under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R.
                  Section 52.244-6. The Parties agree that, insofar as certain

                  shall comply, [**] with those clauses required by applicable

                  items.

         (b)      SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. The Parties do not believe that the
                  Services provided by Amdocs under this Agreement will be
                  subject to government flow-down requirements other than those
                  associated with any subcontracts for commercial items. Should
                  compliance by Amdocs with additional flow-down provisions
                  nevertheless be required by the federal government in certain
                  circumstances, Amdocs shall comply with such additional
                  flow-down provisions as are required by applicable regulations
                  to be included in a subcontract, and the Parties shall
                  negotiate in good faith regarding the additional
                  consideration, if any, to be paid to Amdocs in such
                  circumstances. [**] pursuant to SECTION 11.5, [**].

                           to ensure that its employees comply with these
                           confidentiality provisions.

         (c)      EXCLUSIONS. SECTION 13.3(b) shall not apply to any particular
                  information which the receiving Party can demonstrate by
                  written documentation (i) is, at the time of disclosure to it,
                  in the public domain other than through a breach of the

                  reference to Proprietary Information of the furnishing Party.
                  In addition, the receiving Party shall not be considered to
                  have breached its obligations under this SECTION 13.3 for
                  disclosing Proprietary Information of the other Party as
                  required, in the opinion of legal counsel, to satisfy any
                  legal requirement of a competent government body, provided
                  that, promptly upon receiving any such request, such Party
                  advises the other Party of the Proprietary Information to be
                  disclosed and the identity of the third party requiring such
                  disclosure prior to making such disclosure in order that the
                  other Party may interpose an objection to such disclosure,
                  take action to assure confidential handling of the Proprietary
                  Information, or take such other action as it deems appropriate
                  to protect the Proprietary Information. The receiving Party
                  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
                  the disclosing Party in its efforts to seek a protective order
                  or other appropriate remedy or in the event such protective
                  order or other remedy is not obtained, to obtain assurance
                  that confidential treatment will be accorded such Proprietary
                  Information.

         (d)      LOSS OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. Each Party shall: (i)

                  which are included in [**]. At least fifteen (15) days prior
                  to the delivery of Equipment containing Hazardous Materials
                  for which SBC is financially responsible to an SBC Site or the
                  transfer of ownership of Amdocs-owned Equipment containing
                  Hazardous Materials to SBC, Amdocs shall provide SBC with a
                  MSDS for such Equipment. Each MSDS must include an attachment

                  reproductive harm. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                  Agreement, SBC shall have the right, but not the duty, to
                  refuse acceptance or rescind the agreement to transfer
                  ownership of any Equipment containing Hazardous Materials
                  without incurring liability. Amdocs shall also ensure that all
                  Equipment addressed in this subsection, which is required by
                  applicable Laws to be marked, is so marked. Amdocs shall also
                  provide SBC with the same information, if any, that it
                  provides to any Amdocs Personnel concerning the disposition of
                  such Equipment.

         (b)      DISPOSITION OF WASTE. [**] shall investigate, select, and
                  identify the transporter, which will be used to transport

                  to receive, handle, dispose, recycle, or treat Waste (Waste
                  Facility). [**]reserves the right to veto any Waste
                  Transporter or Waste Facility selection that [**] knows or has
                  reason to know is not acceptable. Should [**] select a Waste
                  Facility that is a RCRA B permitted facility, [**] agrees to
                  provide the [**] Environmental Management (EM) regional office
                  for the [**] Site producing the Waste with proof that such
                  facility meets the financial assurance obligations imposed
                  upon RCRA B permitted facilities by Laws to compensate third
                  parties for bodily injury or property damage arising from
                  facility operations by (i) a copy of a Hazardous Waste
                  Facility Liability endorsement or a copy of the Certificate of
                  Liability Insurance on file with the Environmental Protection
                  Agency (EPA); (ii) a copy of the letter on file with the EPA
                  from the Waste Facility's chief financial officer
                  demonstrating the Waste Facility's ability to cover liability
                  claims; (iii) a copy of the corporate guarantee on file with
                  the EPA which shows the guarantor has sufficient funds to
                  implement the guarantee, or (iv) any combination of the above.

17.5     INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

         With respect to third party claims, the following procedures shall
         apply:

         (a)      NOTICE. Promptly after receipt by any entity entitled to
                  indemnification (under SECTION 17.1 through SECTION 17.4 or
                  any other provisions of this Agreement) of notice of the
                  commencement or threatened commencement of any civil,
                  criminal, administrative, or investigative action or
                  proceeding involving a claim in respect of which the
                  indemnitee will seek indemnification pursuant to any such
                  Section, the indemnitee shall notify the indemnitor of such
                  claim. No delay or failure to so notify an indemnitor shall
                  relieve it of its obligations under this Agreement except to
                  the extent that such indemnitor has suffered actual prejudice
                  by such delay or failure. Within fifteen (15) days following
                  receipt of notice from the indemnitee relating to any claim,
                  but no later than five (5) days before the date on which any
                  response to a complaint or summons is due, the indemnitor
                  shall notify the indemnitee that the indemnitor elects to
                  assume control of the defense and settlement of that claim (a
                  "NOTICE OF ELECTION").

         (b)      PROCEDURE FOLLOWING NOTICE OF ELECTION. If the indemnitor
                  delivers a Notice of Election within the required notice
                  period, the indemnitor shall assume sole control over the
                  defense and settlement of the claim; provided, however, that
                  (i) the indemnitor shall keep the indemnitee fully apprised at
                  all times as to the status of the defense, and (ii) the
                  indemnitor shall obtain the prior written approval of the
                  indemnitee before entering into any settlement of such claim
                  asserting any liability against the indemnitee or imposing any
                  obligations or restrictions on the indemnitee or ceasing to
                  defend against such claim. The indemnitor shall not be liable
                  for any legal fees or expenses incurred by the indemnitee
                  following the delivery of a Notice of Election; provided,
                  however, that (i) the indemnitee shall be entitled to employ
                  counsel at its own expense to participate in the handling of
                  the claim, and (ii) the indemnitor shall pay the fees and
                  expenses associated with such counsel if, in the reasonable
                  judgment of the indemnitee, based on an opinion of counsel,
                  there is a conflict of interest with respect to such claim or
                  if the indemnitor has requested the assistance of the
                  indemnitee in the defense of the claim or the indemnitor has
                  failed to defend the claim diligently. The indemnitor shall
                  not be obligated to indemnify the indemnitee for any amount
                  paid or payable by such indemnitee in the settlement of any
                  claim if (x) the indemnitor has delivered a timely Notice of
                  Election and such amount was agreed to without the written
                  consent of the indemnitor, (y) the indemnitee has not provided
                  the indemnitor with notice of such claim and a reasonable
                  opportunity to respond

                  Notice of Election has not yet expired.

         (c)      PROCEDURE WHERE NO NOTICE OF ELECTION IS DELIVERED. If the
                  indemnitor does not deliver a Notice of Election relating to
                  any claim within the required notice period, the indemnitee
                  shall have the right to defend the claim in such manner, as it
                  may deem appropriate. The indemnitor shall promptly reimburse
                  the indemnitee for all such costs and expenses incurred by the
                  indemnitee, including attorneys' fees.

17.6     SUBROGATION.

         Except as otherwise provided in SECTIONS 16.1 or 16.2 in the event that
         an indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify an indemnitee pursuant to
         SECTION 17.1 through SECTION 17.4 or any other provision of this
         Agreement, the indemnitor shall, upon payment of such indemnity in
         full, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee with respect to the
         claims to which such indemnification relates.

18.      LIABILITY.

18.1     FORCE MAJEURE.

         (a)      GENERAL. Subject to SECTION 18.1(d), neither Party shall be
                  liable for any default or delay in the performance of its
                  obligations under this Agreement if and to the extent such
                  default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by fire,
                  flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God; wars,
                  riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any
                  other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such
                  Party, except to the extent the non-performing Party is at
                  fault in failing to prevent or causing such default or delay,
                  and provided that such default or delay can not reasonably be
                  circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of
                  alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. A strike,
                  lockout or labor dispute involving Amdocs or a Subcontractor
                  and its own personnel shall not excuse Amdocs from its
                  obligations hereunder. [**]. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                  force majeure events shall not excuse SBC's payment
                  obligations under this Agreement.

         (b)      DURATION AND NOTIFICATION. In such event the non-performing
                  Party shall be excused from further performance or observance
                  of the obligation(s) so affected for as long as such
                  circumstances prevail and such Party continues to use all
                  commercially reasonable efforts to recommence performance or
                  observance whenever and to whatever extent possible without
                  delay. The Party so prevented, hindered or delayed in its

19.      DISPUTE RESOLUTION

19.1     INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

         Prior to the initiation of formal dispute resolution procedures with
         respect to any dispute, other than as provided in SECTION 19.1(c) or
         SECTION 20.7, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such dispute
         informally, as follows:

         (a)      INITIAL EFFORT. The Parties agree that they shall attempt in
                  good faith to resolve all disputes (other than those described
                  in SECTION 19.1(c) or SECTION 20.7) in accordance with Section
                  4.0 of Part 5 of SCHEDULE E (Statement of Work - Governance).
                  In the event of a dispute that is not resolved or resolvable
                  in accordance therewith, either Party may refer the dispute
                  for resolution in accordance with SECTION 19.2 below upon
                  written notice to the other Party.

         (b)      PROVISION OF INFORMATION. During the course of negotiations
                  under SECTION 19.1(a) above, all reasonable requests made by
                  one Party to another for non-privileged information,
                  reasonably related to the dispute, will be honored in order
                  that each of the Parties may be fully advised of the other's
                  position. All negotiation shall be strictly confidential and
                  used solely for the purposes of settlement. Any materials
                  prepared by one Party for these proceedings shall not be used
                  as evidence by the other Party in any subsequent arbitration
                  or litigation; provided, however, the underlying facts
                  supporting such materials may be subject to discovery.

         (c)      PREREQUISITE TO FORMAL PROCEEDINGS. Formal proceedings for the
                  resolution of a dispute may not be commenced until the
                  completion of the process for dispute resolution set forth in
                  Section 4.0 of Part 5 of SCHEDULE E (Statement of Work-

                  obligations under ARTICLE 13 or a dispute subject to SECTION
                  20.7.

19.2     ARBITRATION.

         (a)      Except for claims arising out of the breach of a Party's
                  obligations under ARTICLE 13 or disputes subject to SECTION
                  20.7, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
                  this Agreement, or any breach thereof, which cannot be

                  Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.

         (b)      The Arbitration shall take place in [**], and shall apply the
                  law of the [**]. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final
                  and binding and judgment on the award may be entered in any
                  court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall be
                  instructed to state the reasons for their decisions in
                  writing, including findings of fact and law. The arbitrators
                  shall be bound by the warranties, limitations of liability and
                  other provisions of this Agreement. Except with respect to the
                  provisions of this Agreement that provide for injunctive
                  relief rights, such arbitration shall be a precondition to any
                  application by either Party to any court of competent
                  jurisdiction.

         (c)      Within ten (10) days after delivery of written notice ("NOTICE
                  OF DISPUTE") by one Party to the other in accordance with this
                  Section, the Parties each shall use good faith efforts to
                  mutually agree upon one (1) arbitrator. If the Parties are not
                  able to agree upon one (1) arbitrator within such period of
                  time, then the arbitrator will be chosen in accordance of the
                  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                  Association who has at no time ever represented or acted on
                  behalf of either of the Parties, and is not otherwise
                  affiliated with or interested in either of the Parties.

         (d)      All arbitrators selected pursuant to this Section shall be
                  practicing attorneys with at least five (5) years experience
                  in technology law applicable to the Services. Any such
                  appointment shall be binding upon the Parties. The Parties
                  shall use best efforts to set the arbitration within sixty

                  have the right to exercise such termination under this Section
                  so long as SBC pays for the Services to be received hereunder
                  in advance on a month-to-month basis. If either Party elects
                  to terminate this Agreement due to the insolvency of the other
                  Party, such termination will be deemed to be a termination for
                  cause hereunder.

         (b)      SECTION 365(n). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                  Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Amdocs becomes a
                  debtor under the Bankruptcy Code and rejects this Agreement
                  pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (a "BANKRUPTCY
                  REJECTION"), (i) any and all of the licensee and sublicensee
                  rights of SBC arising under or otherwise set forth in this
                  Agreement, including without limitation the rights of SBC
                  referred to in SECTION 14.6, shall be deemed fully retained by
                  and vested in SBC as protected intellectual property rights
                  under Section 365(n)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code and further
                  shall be deemed to exist immediately before the commencement
                  of the bankruptcy case in which Amdocs is the debtor; (ii) SBC
                  shall have all of the rights afforded to non-debtor licensees
                  and sublicensees under Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code;
                  and (iii) to the extent any rights of SBC under this Agreement
                  which arise after the termination or expiration of this
                  Agreement are determined by a bankruptcy court to not be
                  "intellectual property rights" for purposes of Section 365(n),
                  all of such rights shall remain vested in and fully retained
                  by SBC after any Bankruptcy Rejection as though this Agreement
                  were terminated or expired. SBC shall under no circumstances
                  be required to terminate this Agreement after a Bankruptcy
                  Rejection in order to enjoy or acquire any of its rights under
                  this Agreement, including without limitation any of the rights
                  of SBC referenced in Section.

         (c)      SBC RIGHTS UPON AMDOCS' BANKRUPTCY. In the event of Amdocs'
                  bankruptcy or of the filing of any petition under the federal
                  bankruptcy laws affecting the

21.6     RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.

         Amdocs, in furnishing services to SBC hereunder, is acting as an
         independent contractor, and Amdocs has the sole obligation to
         supervise, manage, contract, direct, procure, perform or cause to be
         performed, all work to be performed by Amdocs under this Agreement.

         except as expressly authorized in this Agreement.

21.7     SEVERABILITY.

         In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the
         law under which this Agreement is to be construed or if any such
         provision is held invalid or unenforceable by a court with jurisdiction
         over the Parties, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to
         reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the Parties in
         accordance with applicable law. The remaining provisions of this
         Agreement and the application of the challenged provision to persons or
         circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
         unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each such provision
         shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.

         Agreement, such action shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
         An approval or consent given by a Party under this Agreement shall not
         relieve the other Party from responsibility for complying with the
         requirements of this Agreement, nor shall it be construed as a waiver
         of any rights under this Agreement, except as and to the extent
         otherwise expressly provided in such approval or consent.

22.1     WAIVER OF DEFAULT; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

         (a)      WAIVER OF DEFAULT. A delay or omission by either Party hereto
                  to exercise any right or power under this Agreement shall not
                  be construed to be a waiver thereof. A waiver by either of the
                  Parties hereto of any of the covenants to be performed by the
                  other or any breach thereof shall not be construed to be a
                  waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other
                  covenant herein contained. All waivers must be in writing and
                  signed by the Party waiving its rights.

         (b)      CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. All remedies provided for in this
                  Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in

                  in equity or otherwise.

                                                             Satisfaction Survey

SCHEDULE Q: SATISFACTION SURVEY

This document is designed to provide a high level description of the
Satisfaction Surveys that have been identified in SLA documents related to ADM,
End User Support, Business Process Procurement and Governance. In addition to
specifics outlined here, the surveys must be developed and administered per
specifications outlined within the individual SLA documents, subject to
oversight by the Governance team.

Purpose of Survey

The four identified surveys will need to be designed and distributed in
compliance with provisions outlined in this document, then administered to
management and selected Users on a regularly scheduled basis for the purpose of
evaluating vendor performance to key satisfaction indicators. The vendor will be
responsible for outlining specific action plans (which will be presented to and
approved by the Governance team) designed to address issues identified via
survey results.

Survey Objectives

As part of the survey development process, the Governance team will provide
information on the specific services that need to be evaluated (related to key
drivers of satisfaction); target groups that can provide the most meaningful
insight into reasons behind potential dissatisfaction; and will use initial
results to set baselines and parameters to indicate the desired amount of
ongoing improvement contingent on all survey scales having a 1-7 rating, with an
expected weighted evaluation rating of 6.

The surveys will need to be designed with interchangeable evaluation criteria
components that can be used (as appropriate) across all 4 surveys. The following
table indicates components and applicability:

In addition, surveys will need to be repeated on a regularly scheduled basis to
provide year-over-year result comparisons. On an ongoing basis, the Governance
Team will be responsible for reviewing and approving Amdocs' improvement action
plans (associated with survey results) as well as associated progress against
those plans. In addition, it is expected that results will be shared with
respondents, along with action plans related to improvement / issue resolution.

Structure and Logistics

This section provides guidelines on how the survey should be structured,
administered and analyzed.

                                                          Agreement No. 02026409
                                                                      Schedule Q
                                                             Satisfaction Survey

         -        Each survey should contain at least one question to evaluate
                  whether or not the prospective respondent is familiar with
                  Amdocs and the services they provide. This will allow
                  irrelevant and/or disinterested responses to be weeded out of
                  the results

         -        Survey questions need to evaluate both efficiency and
                  effectiveness of services provided

         -        Each survey should not take more than 10-15 minutes to
                  complete

         -        Survey questions will need to be designed to cover four
                  evaluation points for each service:

                           -        SCREENED (question to make sure the service
                                    is relevant to the respondent. Example: Is
                                    online availability important to you? Yes /
                                    No)

                           -        WEIGHTED (to provide input on how important
                                    / relevant the service is to them. Example:
                                    How important? 1-7 response)

                           -        RATED (the core effectiveness question.
                                    Example: How satisfied are you with online
                                    availability? 1-7 response)

                           -        JUSTIFIED (question that provides
                                    opportunity for feedback comments. Example:
                                    What improvement would increase your
                                    satisfaction? Open ended response / comment
                                    section)

         -        Each survey needs to contain a short list of items that each
                  respondent can use to indicate the evaluation criteria
                  categories that are important to their satisfaction.

                           -        For the four surveys covered by this
                                    document, the list of items should directly
                                    correlate to the evaluation criteria
                                    categories applicable to each specific
                                    survey

                           -        Each of those criteria would have associated
                                    questions in the survey and each criterion
                                    would also be listed in a section that asks
                                    the respondent to check all items that are
                                    relevant to him/her.

                           -        Data Analysis will take into consideration
                                    whether or not the respondent checked a
                                    particular criterion as being important to
                                    them.

         -        For each criteria area, respondents should be asked questions
                  designed to rate their relative importance and satisfaction
                  related to the category, as well as offer recommendations for
                  improvement for each criteria category they respond to

         -        Demographics need to be included so data analysis can review
                  responses for trends based on location, organization, etc

         -        Prior to administering the pending survey and associated
                  administration process will need to be well communicated to
                  the client community

         -        Random sample size will need to be targeted to provide a 99%
                  confidence level

         -        Resulting data must be validated and normalized

         -        Result analysis will need to reflect overall satisfaction
                  issues ranked by priority and evaluated for diverging needs.

         -        The composite score of each response will need to be a
                  combination of importance and satisfaction the client
                  reflected across each criteria point.

Target Groups

The ADM, End User Support, and Business Process Procurement surveys will be
taken by randomly selected members of the SBCDO client community for the purpose
of providing focused, anonymous feedback to the vendor and the Governance team
related to services received via Amdocs. The Governance survey will target
responses from all the SBC members of the Governance team, as well as any
applicable members of the SBC IT organization.

Action Plans

Amdocs will be responsible for generating action plan for targeted areas that
the survey results indicate are in need of improvement. These plans must be
explicit, actionable and have associated timelines. They will also need to be
presented to the Governance team and obtain their sign-off prior to enactment

                        the information that it has discovered with respect to
                        such error, in order to assist Amdocs to correct such
                        error. Promptly upon receipt of such information, Amdocs
                        will identify the cause for and correct the error and
                        will provide the corrective solution to SBC. SBC will
                        implement the correction based on the specific and

                        SBC for the time spent in handling, diagnosing and
                        correcting the matter, at the time and materials rates
