                           and provisions of this Agreement, for the period
                           beginning on the date of the First Amendment to this
                           Employment Agreement and ending as of the close of

         2.       Section 2 of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by
                  deleting the first sentence thereof and substituting the
                  following for such sentence:

                           "During the Employment Period, the Employee shall
                           serve either as Chairman of the Board of Directors of
                           the Parent, or as Chairman of the Board of Directors
                           and Chief Executive Officer of the Parent, as
                           designated at the discretion of the Board of
                           Directors of the Parent, and shall have the duties,
                           powers and authority heretofore possessed by the
                           holder of such office(s) and

<PAGE>

                           such other powers consistent therewith as are
                           delegated to him in writing from time to time by the
                           Board of Directors of the Parent (the "Board").

         3.       Section 4(c) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by
                  adding a new subparagraph at the end of such Section to be and
                  read as follows:

                           "It is understood and agreed that the First Amendment
                           to this Employment Agreement shall not constitute
                           "Good Reason" for purposes of this Agreement."

         4.       Section 4(e) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by
                  deleting the last sentence of such Section.

         5.       Section 5(a) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by
                  deleting all of the language within the parenthetical at the
                  end of such Section so that the Section ends prior to such
                  parenthetical.

         6.       The terms and provisions of the Employment Agreement, as
                  amended hereby, continue in full force and effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Employee and, pursuant to due authorization
from the Board, the Company have caused this Amendment to be executed as of the
date first above written.
