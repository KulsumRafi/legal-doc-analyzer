GENERAL
-------

Imagistics will continue to use the PBI telephone systems specified shared
locations. This will include local and long distance service for the Imagistics
employees in the specified locations.

DURATION
--------

Distribution Date to the termination or expiry of shared lease locations.

PBI may at its sole discretion, require Imagistics to acquire at Imagistics'
expense their own telephone switches for any of the specified locations with 90
days written notice. Such an action will terminate the specific allocation
related to the impacted location, but will not cause the cancellation of the
agreement as relates to the other specified locations.

COST
----

Actual monthly local and long distance charges in the specified shared locations
will be allocated to Imagistics based on the proportion of the Imagistics rented
space as a percentage of the total square footage of the location.

In addition, Imagistics will be charged a proportionate amount of depreciation
(based on PBI's standard accounting practice for depreciation) of all shared
switches based on the above allocation methodology.

Charges will be billed monthly in arrears at cost incurred. Average Imagistics
historic monthly charges have been approximately $18-$20,000 per month.

INCLUDED SERVICES

Local and Long Distance Service.

SPECIFIED OFFICE LOCATIONS
--------------------------

The included office locations are identified in a list previously provided and

     SECTION 3.   Proposed Charges.

COMPUTER SUPPORT SERVICES
TechCentral's proposed 2003 charge to Imagistics for Computer Support Services
is approximately $3.5 million and includes all direct charges, mainframe
computer utilization based on past utilization rates, and other indirect
expenses. This charge will be paid in monthly payments in January and February,
2003, based on a six (6) month pro-rata calculation with the remaining balance
paid in equal installments over the ten (10) month period from March to
December, 2003.

SOFTWARE LICENSE

The estimated license fees are as set forth below, which cover the
renewal/continuation of software licenses which are required by Imagistics but
are no longer used by Pitney Bowes or are contractually required because of
Imagistics separation status. This charge will be based on actual costs incurred
and shall be charged to Imagistics when PBI is invoiced by its applicable
vendor.

HARDWARE/MAINTENANCE

Estimated charges for building and maintaining the capacity necessitated by
extra transaction volume due to Imagistics' testing activities. This charge will
be based on actual costs incurred and shall be charged to Imagistics when PBI is
invoiced by its applicable vendor. Some portion of these costs may be incurred
and billed in 2002 due to early upgrade request from Imagistics.
