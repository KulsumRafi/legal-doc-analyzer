<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublessor
is the current tenant under a lease agreement dated as of June&nbsp;19, 2000 (the "Master Lease") by and between THE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF THE STATE
OF HAWAII, a Government agency of the State of Hawaii, as landlord, and Sublessor, as tenant (the "Master Lease"), a copy of which is attached hereto as </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublessor
hereby leases and demises to Sublessee, and Sublessee hereby takes and hires from Sublessor, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, improvements
containing, in the aggregate, approximately 7,417 square feet of rentable space in an office space located in the second floor suite at 222 E. Huntington Drive, Monrovia, California, all as more
particularly described in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto (the "Leased Premises"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions set forth herein, Sublessor and Sublessee further understand and agree
that: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Lease shall be effective as of the date hereof, but its terms shall commence on December&nbsp;17, 2002 (the "Commencement Date") and shall end
on the earlier of (a)&nbsp;December&nbsp;1, 2003, or (b)&nbsp;the date the Master Lease expires or terminates (the "Term"). Landlord agrees to use its best commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant by the Commencement Date. If, despite said efforts, Landlord is unable to deliver possession as agreed, Landlord shall not be subject to liability
therefore, nor shall such failure affect the validity of this Lease. Tenant shall not, however, be obligated to pay Rent or perform its other obligations until it receives possession of the Premises.
If possession is not delivered within 60&nbsp;days after </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>December&nbsp;17, 2002</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Tenant may, at its option, by notice in writing within
10&nbsp;days after the end of such 60&nbsp;day period, cancel this Lease, in which event the parties to this Lease shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder. If such written notice is not
received by Landlord within said 10-day period, Tenant's right to cancel shall terminate. Except as otherwise provided, if possession is not tendered to Tenant by </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>February&nbsp;17, 2002</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, and Tenant does
not terminate this Lease, any period of rent abatement that Tenant would otherwise have enjoyed shall run from
the date of delivery of possession and continue for a period equal to what Tenant would otherwise have enjoyed under the terms of this Lease, but minus any days of delay caused by the acts or
omissions of Tenant. If possession of the Premises is not delivered within four months after </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>December&nbsp;17, 2002</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, this Lease shall terminate unless
other agreements are reached between Landlord and Tenant, in writing. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein contained, Sublessee may, at any time after the last day of the sixth (6th) full calendar month of the term, upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days
advance written notice, terminate the term of this Lease. In the event of such notice, the Term shall end on the date set forth in such notice (but in no event earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day
after the receipt thereof by Lessor), and the Base Rent shall be pro-rated. The Sublessor shall deliver possession of the premises to the Sublessee on the Commencement Date. </FONT></P>
