     This Stock Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement") is dated as of February
20, 2003 (the "Execution Date"), by and among The Houston Exploration Company, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), KeySpan Corporation, a New York
corporation ("KeySpan") and THEC Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("THEC
Holdings"), a wholly owned subsidiary of KeySpan.

                                 R E C I T A L S

     WHEREAS, THEC Holdings owns 20,380,392 shares, or approximately 66%, of the
Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock");

     WHEREAS, the Company and KeySpan have entered into an underwriting
agreement, dated the Execution Date (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Underwriter") pursuant to which the Company is
publicly offering (the "Public Offering") for cash (i) 3,000,000 shares of its
Common Stock and (ii) in the event the Underwriter exercises its over-allotment
option pursuant to Sections 1 and 3 of the Underwriting Agreement, up to an
additional 300,000 shares of its Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the
Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-78843) (as amended to the
date hereof, the "Registration Statement") and a prospectus supplement (together
with the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, the "Prospectus")
filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act (as defined herein);

     WHEREAS, THEC Holdings desires to sell, and the Company desires to
purchase, (i) 3,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by
THEC Holdings (the "Original Shares") upon the terms and conditions hereinafter
set forth (the "Original Purchase") and (ii) up to an additional 300,000 issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by THEC Holdings (the "Option
Shares", together with the Original Shares, the "Shares")) upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth (the "Option Purchase", together with the
Original Purchase, the "Purchase"); and

     WHEREAS, the Company, KeySpan and THEC Holdings desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Purchase;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

     1.1. Purchase and Sale of Common Stock. On the basis of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein, and subject to the

<PAGE>

     1.2. Purchase Price. The Company agrees to pay to THEC Holdings for all the
Original Shares the amount of $78,700,000, which represents the offering
proceeds to be received by the Company from the Public Offering (the "Offering
Proceeds") at the purchase price to the Underwriter of $26.40 per share of
Common Stock (the "Per Share Price") less Estimated Expenses (as defined in
Section 7.11(c)) of $500,000. In the event the Underwriter exercises its
over-allotment option pursuant to Sections 1 and 3 of the Underwriting
Agreement, the Company agrees to purchase from THEC Holdings the number of
Option Shares equal to the aggregate number of shares so purchased by the
Underwriter at the Per Share Price.

     1.3. Closing.

     (a) The closing of the Original Purchase (the "Closing") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on February 26, 2003, subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI on or before such date, at the
offices of Andrews & Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, or
such later date (which shall not be later than the third Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI) or at such
other place as agreed to by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the
Closing are referred to herein as the "Closing Time" and "Closing Date,"
respectively). As used in this Agreement, the term "Business Day" shall mean any
weekday other than a banking holiday in New York City.

     (b) At the Closing, in addition to the deliveries required to be made at or
prior to the Closing pursuant to Article VI hereof,

          (i) THEC Holdings shall sell, assign and transfer to the Company all
     its right, title and interest in and to the Original Shares free and clear
     of all mortgages, pledges, security interests, liens, claims, encumbrances
     or equities (collectively, the "Liens") and deliver to the Company one or
     more certificates representing the Original Shares owned and being
     purchased pursuant to this Agreement, duly endorsed in blank or with duly
     executed stock powers attached; and

          (ii) the Company shall pay THEC Holdings cash in an amount equal to
     the Offering Proceeds received by the Company pursuant to the Public
     Offering, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
     designated by THEC Holdings.

     1.4. Option Closing.

     (a) In the event the Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option, the

Section 1.3(a) or at such other place as agreed to by the parties hereto (the
actual time and date of the Closing are referred to herein as the "Option
Closing Time" and "Option Closing Date," respectively).

     its right, title and interest in and to the Option Shares free and clear of
     all Liens and deliver to the Company one or more certificates representing
     the Option Shares owned and being purchased pursuant to this Agreement,
     duly endorsed in blank or with duly executed stock powers attached; and

          (ii) the Company shall pay THEC Holdings cash in an amount equal to
     the Per Share Price multiplied by the aggregate number of shares purchased
     by the Underwriter upon the exercise of its over-allotment option, by wire
     transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by THEC
     Holdings.

harmless each of KeySpan, THEC Holdings, their respective officers, directors
and each person who controls KeySpan or THEC Holdings within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") (collectively,
the "KeySpan/THEC Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all


                                       5

<PAGE>

losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, the
legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action,
proceeding or any claim asserted) arising out of or based on any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
prospectus, offering circular or other document (including any related
registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any registration,
qualification or compliance with respect to the Public Offering, or any omission
(or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (except
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or alleged omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to KeySpan or THEC
Holdings furnished to the Company in writing by KeySpan or THEC Holdings,
respectively, expressly for use therein), or any violation by the Company of the
Securities Act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to the Company
and relating to action or inaction required by the Company in connection with
any registration, qualification, or compliance with respect to the Public
Offering.

     5.2. Indemnification by KeySpan and THEC Holdings. KeySpan and THEC
Holdings will, jointly and severally, indemnify the Company, each of its
officers, directors and each person who controls the Company within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Company Indemnified Persons"), from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, the
legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action, proceeding
or any claim asserted) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus,
offering circular or other document (including any related registration
statement, notification or the like) incident to any registration, qualification
or compliance with respect to the Public Offering, or any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference
to information relating to KeySpan or THEC Holdings furnished to the Company in
writing by KeySpan or THEC Holdings, respectively, expressly for use therein.
The liability of KeySpan and THEC Holdings pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
limited to the Offering Proceeds.

     5.3. Indemnification Procedures. If any suit, action, proceeding (including
any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought
or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Article V, such person (the
"Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person or persons against whom
such indemnity may be sought (each an "Indemnifying Person") in writing, and
such Indemnifying Persons, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the
Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Persons may designate in such
proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person and not the
Indemnifying Persons unless (i) the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified
Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person
has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both an Indemnifying Person and the
Indemnified Person and, based upon the advice of counsel, representation of both
parties by


                                       6

<PAGE>

the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them. It is understood that no Indemnifying Person shall, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction,
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. No Indemnifying
Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final
non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, each Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is
or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by
such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding.

     5.4. Contribution. The Company, KeySpan and THEC Holdings agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article V were
determined by pro rata allocation. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified
Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in
this Article V shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article V, in no
event shall KeySpan or THEC Holdings be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount of Offering Proceeds received by it, respectively. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

     5.5. Full Force and Effect. The remedies provided for in this Article V are
not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and
contribution agreements contained in this Article V and the representations and

     7.8. Assignment; Binding on Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be

Subject to the preceding sentence and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be

     7.9. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in

entitled at law or in equity.

     7.10. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.

     7.11. Expenses.

     (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, KeySpan shall pay the fees and expenses of its counsel, investment
bankers, financial advisors, accountants and other experts and the other

and expenses of the Company and the Special Committee (or any of its members) of
the Board of Directors of the Company incurred in connection therewith (the

upon material adverse information relating to the Company that is not known by
or available (upon request from the Company or otherwise) to KeySpan on the date
hereof, KeySpan shall not be liable for the reimbursement of any Expenses
pursuant to this Section 7.11(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
understand and agree that the Expenses shall not include any fees and expenses
of any underwriter other than J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.


                                       11

     (c) If the Closing does occur, an estimate of the Expenses (the "Estimated

on the actual amount of the Expenses (the "Actual Expenses") incurred by the
Company and the Special Committee (or any of its members) of the Board of
Directors of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and (i) in the event the Actual Expenses exceed the Estimated Expenses, KeySpan
shall reimburse the Company for such difference or (ii) in the event the
Estimated Expenses exceed the Actual Expenses, the Company shall reimburse
KeySpan for such difference.

Agreement to the contrary, each of the Company, KeySpan and THEC Holdings affirm

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

New York, New York  10017

     Re:  The Houston Exploration Company -- Public Offering

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned understands that you, as underwriter (the "Underwriter"),
propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement")
with The Houston Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
and KeySpan Corporation, a New York corporation ("KeySpan"), providing for the
sale by the Company to the Underwriter of common stock, $0.01 par value (the
"Common Stock"), of the Company and the public offering (the "Public Offering")
of the Common Stock by the Underwriter. Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement
(the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), dated as of the date of the Underwriting
Agreement, among the Company, KeySpan and THEC Holdings Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the "THEC Holdings") and a wholly owned subsidiary of KeySpan, the
Company will, among other things, apply the offering proceeds received by the
Company from the Public Offering to the purchase of 3,000,000 shares of Common
Stock owned by THEC Holdings. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.

     In consideration of the Underwriter's agreement to purchase and make the
Public Offering of the Common Stock, and for other good and valuable
consideration receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned
hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc., such undersigned will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date
of the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Public Offering (the "Prospectus"),
other than with respect to the shares of Common Stock to be sold pursuant to the
Stock Purchase Agreement, (1) directly or indirectly offer, pledge, announce the
intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, any shares of Common
Stock or any securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the
Common Stock, including, but not limited to, any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common
Stock or any such substantially similar securities (including, but not limited
to, Common Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission) or (2) enter into any swap, option, future, forward or other
agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences
of


                                       1

<PAGE>

ownership of the Common Stock or any securities of the Company which are
substantially similar to the Common Stock, including, but not limited to, any
security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or that represent
the right to receive, Common Stock or any such substantially similar securities,
whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be
settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise. In addition, each of the undersigned agrees that, without the prior
written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., it will not, during the period
ending 90 days after the Closing Date, make any demand for or exercise any right
with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any
substantially similar securities of the Company, including, but not limited to,
any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.

     In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and any duly appointed
transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described
herein are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if
such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Agreement.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement, it is
expressly understood that the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement shall not apply to
any transaction that results in a Change in Control of the Company. For the
purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, "Change in Control" shall mean any change in
ownership of the shares of stock of the Company such that a person or group of
persons other than KeySpan or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries acquires a
direct or indirect interest in the voting stock of the Company which is greater
than the direct or indirect interest in the voting stock of the Company held by
KeySpan and any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.

     Each of the undersigned hereby represents and warrants that such
undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement.
All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred and any obligations of
such undersigned shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs or
personal representatives of such undersigned.

     Each of the undersigned understands that, if the Underwriting Agreement
does not become effective, or if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the
provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated
prior to payment for and delivery of the Common Stock to be sold thereunder, the
undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this Lock-Up Agreement.

     Each of the undersigned understands that the Underwriter is entering into
the Underwriting Agreement and proceeding with the Public Offering in reliance
upon this Lock-Up Agreement.

     THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
