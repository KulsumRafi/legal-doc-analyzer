The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to accelerate the time at which any and all of the Restricted Stock shall vest, or to remove any or all restrictions, whenever the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that such action is appropriate by reason of changes to applicable tax or other laws, or other changes in circumstances occurring after the Grant Date. Until January 1, 2009, any shares of Restricted Stock which have not vested are subject to the restrictions and forfeiture provisions as provided herein or in the Plan. </P>

<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will issue certificates in respect of the shares of Restricted Stock in the name of the Participant, and bearing a legend evidencing the nature of the Restricted Stock and will hold such certificates on deposit for the account of the Participant until such time as the shares represented thereby are vested<B>.  </B>Subject to the provisions of the Plan, unlegended certificates representing vested shares and the related stock powers will be delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable after vesting occurs. </P>

<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the acknowledgment and delivery of this Restricted Stock Award Grant by the Participant, the Participant will execute and deliver to the Company a stock power for each Restricted Stock certificate issued in favor of the Company, which will permit transfer to the Company of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock that shall be forfeited, as provided herein and in the Plan. </P>

<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in the Plan and subject to such other restrictions, if any, as determined by the Committee, the Participant, as owner of the Restricted Stock, shall have all rights of a stockholder of the Company's Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the right to receive dividends paid with respect to the Restricted Stock and the right to vote (or to execute proxies for voting) such shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Restricted Stock shall not be eligible for enrollment in the Company's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.</P>

<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No provision contained in this Restricted Stock Award Grant will in any way terminate, modify or alter, or be construed or interpreted as terminating, modifying or altering any of the powers, rights or authority vested in the Committee pursuant to the terms of the Plan or resolutions adopted in furtherance of the Plan, including, without limitation, the right to make certain determinations and elections with respect to the Restricted Shares.</P>
