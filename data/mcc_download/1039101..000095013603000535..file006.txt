                             this Guarantee would constitute or result in a
                             violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance
                             or similar law of any relevant jurisdiction, the
                             liability of each Guarantor under this Supplemental
                             Indenture and its Guarantee shall be reduced to the
                             maximum amount permissible under such fraudulent
                             conveyance or similar law.

                  3.    EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF GUARANTEES.

                             Supplemental Indenture, each Guarantor hereby
                             agrees that a notation of such Guarantee, the form
                             of which is included in the Form of Security
                             attached as Exhibit A to the Indenture, shall be
                             endorsed by an officer of such Guarantor on each
                             Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
                             after the date hereof.

                        (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Guarantor
                             hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth herein
                             shall remain in full force and effect
                             notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note
                             a notation of such Guarantee.

                        (c)  If an Officer whose signature is on this
                             Supplemental Indenture or on the Guarantee no
                             longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
                             authenticates the Note on which a Guarantee is
                             endorsed, the Guarantee shall be valid
                             nevertheless.

                        (d)  The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the
                             authentication thereof under the Indenture, shall
                             constitute due delivery of the Guarantee set forth
                             in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of each
                             Guarantor.

                        (e)  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations
                             hereunder shall be unconditional, regardless of the
                             validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes
                             or the Indenture, the absence of any action to
                             enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any
                             Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions
                             of the Notes or the Indenture, the recovery of any
                             judgment against the Company, any action to enforce
                             the same or any other circumstance which might
                             otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge
                             or defense of a guarantor.

                             except by complete performance of the obligations

                        (g)  If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any

                             Guarantor, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or
                             other similar official acting in relation to either
                             the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by

                        (h)  Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled
                             to any right of subrogation in relation to the

                                  Supplemental Indenture, notwithstanding any
                                  stay, injunction or other prohibition
                                  preventing such acceleration in respect of the
                                  obligations guaranteed hereby;

                                  Guarantor so long as the exercise of such
                                  right does not impair the rights of the
                                  Holders or the Trustee under the Guarantee
                                  made pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture.

                             Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall

                             that such Guarantor is not the surviving
                             corporation in the merger), by supplemental
                             indenture satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
                             executed and delivered to the Trustee, by the
                             corporation formed by such consolidation, or into
                             which such Guarantor shall have been merged, or by
                             the corporation which shall have acquired such
                             property, (ii) immediately after giving effect to
                             such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance no
                             Default or Event of Default exists, and (iii) such
                             transaction will only be permitted under the
                             Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture if it
                             would be permitted under the terms of all of the
                             indentures governing the Outstanding Senior
                             Subordinated Notes as the same are in effect on the
                             date hereof (whether or not those indentures are
                             subsequently amended, waived, modified or
                             terminated or expire and whether or not any of
                             these notes continue to be outstanding).

                        (c)  In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or
                             conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor
                             corporation, by

                                                                               6

                             supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to
                             the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the
                             Trustee, of the Guarantee made pursuant to this
                             Supplemental Indenture and the due and punctual
                             performance of all of the covenants and conditions
                             of the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture to
                             be performed by each Guarantor, such successor
                             corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for
                             such Guarantor with the same effect as if it had
                             been named herein as one of the Guarantors. Such
                             successor corporation thereupon may cause to be
                             signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed
                             upon the Notes issuable under the Indenture which
                             theretofore shall not have been signed by the
                             Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the
                             Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the
                             same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture and
                             this Supplemental Indenture as the Guarantees
                             theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance
                             with the terms of the Indenture and this
                             Supplemental Indenture as though all of such
                             Guarantees had been issued at the date of the
                             execution hereof.

                  5.    RELEASES.

                        (a)  Concurrently with any sale of assets (including, if
                             applicable, all of the Capital Stock of a
                             Guarantor), all Liens, if any, in favor of the
                             Trustee in the assets sold thereby shall be
                             released. If the assets sold in such sale or other
                             disposition include all or substantially all of the
                             assets of a Guarantor or all of the Capital Stock
                             of a Guarantor, then the Guarantor (in the event of
                             a sale or other disposition of all of the Capital
                             Stock of such Guarantor) or the Person acquiring
                             the property (in the event of a sale or other
                             disposition of all or substantially all of the
                             assets of such Guarantor) shall be released from
                             and relieved of its obligations under this
                             Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee made
                             pursuant hereto. Upon delivery by the Company to
                             the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate to the
                             effect that such sale or other disposition was made
                             by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may
                             be, in accordance with the provisions of the
                             Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, the
                             Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably
                             required in order to evidence the release of the
                             Guarantor from its obligations under this
                             Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee made
                             pursuant hereto. If the Guarantor is not released
                             from its obligations under its Guarantee, it shall
                             remain liable for the full amount of principal of
                             and interest on the Notes and for the other
                             obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture
                             as provided in this Supplemental Indenture.

                        (b)  Upon the designation of a Guarantor as an Excluded
                             Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
                             Indenture and the indentures

                                                                               7

                             governing the Outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes
                             as the same are in effect on the date hereof
                             (whether or not those indentures are subsequently
                             amended, waived, modified or terminated or expire
                             and whether or not any of those notes continue to
                             be outstanding), such Guarantor shall be released
                             and relieved of its obligations under the Indenture
                             and this Supplemental Indenture. Upon delivery by
                             the Company to the Trustee of an Officers'
                             Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
                             that such designation of such Guarantor as an
                             Excluded Subsidiary was made by the Company in
                             accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and
                             the indentures governing the Outstanding Senior
                             Subordinated Notes as the same are in effect on the
                             date hereof (whether or not those indentures are
                             subsequently amended, waived, modified, terminated
                             or expired and whether or not any of those notes
                             continue to be outstanding), the Trustee shall
                             execute any documents reasonably required in order
                             to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its
                             obligations under its Guarantee. Any Guarantor not
                             released from its obligations under its Guarantee
                             shall remain liable for the full amount of
                             principal of and interest on the Notes and for the
                             other obligations of any Guarantor under the
                             Indenture as provided herein.

                  6.    NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of any
Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
or any Guarantor under the Notes, any Guarantees, the Indenture or this
Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to
waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the
Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.

                  7.    SUBORDINATION OF GUARANTEES; ANTI-LAYERING. No Guarantor
shall incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any
Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to any Senior
Debt of a Guarantor and senior in any respect in right of payment to any of the
Guarantees. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantee of each
Guarantor shall be subordinated to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt
of that Guarantor, which shall include all guarantees of Senior Debt.

                  8.    THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  9.    COUNTERPARTS. The parties may sign any number of copies
of this Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all
of them together represent the same agreement.
