                       LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT

                         ROXBURY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

      This Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Roxbury
Capital Management, LLC (the "LLC") is made as of July 31, 1998 ("Agreement"),
by and among Roxbury Capital Management, a California corporation ("Roxbury"),
WT Investments, Inc. ("WTI"), a Delaware corporation which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware-chartered bank and trust
company ("WTC"), the Principals (as hereinafter defined) and Wilmington Trust
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Wilmington").

      WHEREAS, the LLC has heretofore been formed as a limited liability company
pursuant to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, 6 Del. C. Section
18-101, et seq., as amended from time to time (the "Delaware Act"), by the
filing of a Certificate of Formation of the LLC with the office of the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware on April 14, 1998, as amended by that certain
Certificate of Amendment dated July 20, 1998 (as amended, the "Certificate"),
and by the execution of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the LLC by
Roxbury and Anthony H. Browne as of April 14, 1998 (the "Original LLC
Agreement");

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the LLC Interest Purchase Agreement (as hereinafter
defined), WTI purchased the Preferred Interests in the LLC from Roxbury; and

      WHEREAS, the Members desire to continue to operate the LLC as a limited
liability company under the Delaware Act on the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set
forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, Roxbury, the Principals,
Wilmington and WTI, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

                                        1

                                  DEFINED TERMS

      Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in this Article 1
shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, have the meanings herein specified.

      1.1   "Adjusted Capital Account Deficit" means, with respect to any
Member, the deficit balance, if any, in such Member's Capital Account as of the
end of the relevant Fiscal Year or other period, after giving effect to the
following adjustments:
<PAGE>
            (i)   Credit to such Capital Account for any amounts that such
      Member is deemed to be obligated to restore with respect to any deficit
      balance in its Capital Account pursuant to Sections
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3) and 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) of the Treasury
      Regulations;

            (ii)  Credit to such Capital Account for any amounts that such
      Member is (or would be) deemed to be obligated to restore with respect to
      any deficit balance in its Capital Account pursuant to Sections
      1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations; and

            (iii) Debit to such Capital Account the items described in Sections
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), and
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of the Treasury Regulations.

The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account Deficit is intended to
comply with the provisions of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Treasury
Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

      1.2   "Adjusted Free Cash Flow" for a Fiscal Year means the Free Cash Flow
for such Fiscal Year adjusted by: (i) adding the Excess Cash Flow Split,
recalculated using [*] as the Hurdle Rate, for such Fiscal Year (see examples in
Exhibit A); and (ii) subtracting 70% of any revenue not attributable to Advisory
Fees for such Fiscal Year.

      1.3   "Adjusted LLC Value" is the LLC Value that shall be used to
determine the Call Price. If a Wilmington Call is exercised prior to the third
anniversary of the later of the Commencement Date or the date of this Agreement,
the Adjusted LLC Value shall equal the Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the Fiscal
Year ending on the Determination Date immediately preceding the year in which
the Wilmington Call Notice is delivered or the Free Cash Flow for Fiscal Year
1998 if the Wilmington Call Notice is delivered in 1998 or 1999. If a Wilmington
Call is exercised after the third anniversary of the later of the Commencement
Date or the date of this Agreement, but prior to the fourth anniversary of such
event, the Adjusted LLC Value shall be computed in the same manner as the LLC
Value using a multiple that is reduced by two. If a Wilmington Call is exercised
after the fourth anniversary of the later of the Commencement Date or the date
of this Agreement, but prior to the fifth anniversary of such event, the
Adjusted LLC Value shall be computed in the same manner as the LLC Value using a
multiple that is reduced by one. If a Wilmington Call is exercised after the
fifth anniversary of the later of the Commencement Date or the date of this
Agreement, the Adjusted LLC Value shall equal the LLC Value.

      1.4   "Advance Payment" means, with respect to the purchase of LLC
Interests under Section 7.3(b) hereof upon the occurrence of an Extraordinary
Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event that occurs after December 31, 1998, an
amount equal to the product of (i) 0.75 and (ii) six times the Average Adjusted
Free Cash Flow for the Fiscal Year immediately preceding the year in which such
Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event occurs or, in the case of an
Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event that occurs during 1999, six
times the Free Cash Flow for Fiscal Year 1998.

plus all Common Membership Points relating to LLC Interests that have been

issued thereunder that are outstanding, exercisable and unexercised in whole or
in part on the Purchase Closing Date.

      1.12  "Capital Account" means, with respect to any Member, the Capital

            (ii)  The Carrying Value of all assets of the LLC shall be adjusted
      to equal their respective gross fair market values, as determined by the

      such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative
      economic interests of the Members in the LLC;

            (iii) The Carrying Value of any asset distributed by the LLC to any
      Member shall be the gross fair market value of such asset on the date of
      distribution; and

            (iv)  The Carrying Value of assets of the LLC shall be increased or
      decreased to reflect any adjustments to the adjusted bases of such assets
      pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b), but only to the
      extent that such adjustments are taken into account in determining Capital
      Accounts pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Treasury
      Regulations; provided, however, that Carrying Values shall not be adjusted
      pursuant to this clause (iv) to the extent the Board determines that an
      adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) hereof is necessary or appropriate in

      pursuant to this clause (iv). If the Carrying Value of an asset has been
      determined or adjusted pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iv) hereof, such
      Carrying Value shall thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation taken into
      account with respect to such assets for purposes of computing Profits and
      Losses.

            (i)   a willful and intentional material breach of this Agreement by

      similar conduct by a Principal or an employee involving the business or

      employee in connection with the performance of his duties for the LLC;

            (iv)  any conduct on the part of a Principal or an employee that
      constitutes a willful breach of any statutory or common law duty of
      loyalty owed to the LLC, a Client or a Wilmington Client;

            (v)   a Principal's or an employee's conviction of a felony; or

            (vi)  a disqualification or revocation of a registration or license

      the material duties by him or her for the LLC.

                                                      stock held by
                                                      such shareholder

common stock and (ii) Roxbury owns 75.44 Common Membership Points, then the
shareholder's Derivative Share equals 75.44 x .10 = 7.544 Common Membership
Points.

of the Put Price would be based on the LLC Value determined as of December 31,
2001 and 153/365 of the Put Price would be based on the LLC Value determined as

or $[   *   ], plus $[   *   ] x .02, 153/365, or $[   *   ], for a total Put
Price of $[   *   ].

to all of the Voting Members. Any notice required hereunder may be waived in

least 10 days' written notice to all the Voting Members, unless such notice is
waived.

      4.4   Action by Consent. Any action of the Voting Members may be taken

taken, if such action had been taken at a meeting of Voting Members, consent to

those Managers present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, with each
Manager on the Board having one vote.

      5.2   Designation of Managers.

            (a)   For so long as Principals and Roxbury together own 50% or more
of the outstanding Membership Points, then five of the Managers shall be
selected or replaced by the Principals by majority vote, which vote shall be
based on their direct and Derivative Share ownership of Membership Points
("Roxbury Designees"). For so long as the Principals and Roxbury together own
Membership Points that are less than 50% of the outstanding Membership Points,
then three of the Managers shall be Roxbury Designees.

two of the Managers shall be selected or replaced by WTI, WTC or Wilmington
("WTI Designee"). For so long as WTI, WTC or Wilmington is a Preferred Member
and such entities collectively own more than 50% of the outstanding Membership
Points, four of the Managers shall be WTI Designees.

election and shall last until the election of his successor or the effective
date of his resignation or removal, whichever is earlier.

      5.4   Resignation or Removal of a Manager.

            (a)   Any Manager may resign by delivering to the LLC a signed
notice indicating his intent to resign and the effective date of his
resignation.

            (b)   The Board or the Voting Members, by Majority Vote, may remove
any Manager (i) for Cause, or (ii) if the Manager becomes subject to a
Disability. A Manager shall be automatically removed as such if he or she
becomes a Non-voting Member. Any Person that has designated a Manager may remove
the Manager, with or without Cause, using the same process that was used to
appoint the Manager at any time upon prior written notice to the LLC.

      5.5   Vacancies. If a Manager should resign or be removed from the Board,
the Person(s) holding the power to designate that Manager pursuant to Section
5.2 hereof may at any time after the resignation or removal designate another
Person to serve as a Manager by written notice to the LLC.

      5.6   Meetings. The Board shall hold regular quarterly meetings without
call or notice at the principal office of the LLC (or at such other place as
shall be determined by the Board) and at such times as the Board may from time
to time determine, provided reasonable notice of the first regular meeting
following any such determination is given to Managers absent at the meeting
fixing regular meetings. When called by the Chairman, or by any two Managers,
the Board may hold special meetings at such places and times as are designated
by the Board in the call of the meeting, upon at least two Business Days' notice
given by the Chairman, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or by the
Managers calling the meeting. Any notice required hereunder may be waived in
writing by the Person to whom notice should have been sent, whether before or
after the related meeting, and attendance at any meeting waives that attendee's

business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

      5.7   Quorum. At any meeting of the Board, the presence of four or more
Managers (at least one of whom shall be a WTI Designee) shall constitute a

majority of votes present at the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present,
and the meeting may be held as adjourned upon at least two Business Days' notice
to all the Managers, unless notice is waived.

<PAGE>
      5.8   Action by Consent. Any action of the Board may be taken without a
meeting if all the Managers consent to the action in writing. The written
consents shall be filed with the records of the meetings of the Board. Such
actions by consent shall be treated for all purposes as actions taken at a
meeting.

      5.9   Telephonic Meetings. Managers may participate in a meeting of the
Board by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment
provided all Managers participating in the meeting can hear each other at the
same time, and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person
at a meeting.

      5.10  Managers as Agents; Limitation on Power of Members. The Managers, to
the extent of the powers set forth herein, are agents of the LLC for the purpose
of the LLC's business, and the actions of the Managers taken in accordance with
such powers shall bind the LLC. No Manager or Member in that Person's capacity
as Manager or Member, acting individually, and no Managers representing less
than the number of Managers necessary for Board action under Sections 5.1, 5.8,
5.9 or 5.11 hereof, may bind the LLC.

      5.11  Board Action. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article
5, the approval of (a) at least one WTI Designee and (b) a majority of the
Roxbury Designees shall be required for any of the following matters: (i) any
determination to engage in a business other than investment management and
advisory services or to change in a fundamental manner the investment
methodology and strategy heretofore used by Roxbury; (ii) issuance of additional
LLC Interests other than upon exercise of an option granted pursuant to an
Incentive Plan; (iii) adoption of an Incentive Plan; (iv) compensation

Delaware limited liability company or other business entity (as defined in
Section 18-209(a) of the Delaware Act), or any dissolution of the LLC; (ix) (A)
the creation or acquisition of any Subsidiary, (B) any consolidation or merger
of any Subsidiary with or into any other Delaware limited liability company or

                                       18

making a determination pursuant to Section 6.3(c); (xviii) any transfer of a
Common Interest to a Person other than a Permitted Transferee or Related Entity;
and (xix) whether a transferee of a Common Interest (whether or not a Permitted
Transferee or Related Entity) shall have voting rights; provided, however, that
the Board may (without the approvals required by this Section 5.11) grant
options to purchase Common Interests that (A) do not contain terms more
favorable to optionees than those set forth in Section 7.1(d) hereof with
respect to Option Agreements, (B) do not represent more than 10% of the Common
Membership Points outstanding on the date hereof and (C) are not granted prior
to the fifth anniversary of the date hereof.

      5.12  Approval of Annual Budget. Subject to Section 5.11(vi) hereof, the
Board alone shall have the power to approve the annual budget of the LLC. If the
annual budget of the LLC is not approved in its entirety by the Board under this
Section, the Board shall approve the budget to the extent of those items on
which there is agreement and shall continue to negotiate in good faith until all
items of the budget are agreed upon.

      5.13  Officers. The Board may appoint agents and employees of the LLC who
are designated as officers of the LLC (the "Officers"). The Officers of the LLC
shall include a Chairman (who must be a Manager), a President and a Secretary
and may include a Vice-Chairman (who must be a Manager), Chief Operating
Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer, one or more Senior Managing
Directors, Managing Directors, Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice
Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Secretaries and such other Officers
with such titles as may be approved by the Board. Subject to Section 5.11, the
Board may remove any Officer at any time, for any reason, in its sole and
absolute discretion. The Officers shall be agents of the LLC, authorized to
execute and deliver documents and take other actions on behalf of the LLC,
subject to the direction of the Board, and to have such other duties as may be
approved by the Board; provided, however, that the delegation of any such power
or authority to the Officers shall not limit in any respect the power and
authority of the Board to take such actions (or any other action) on behalf of
the LLC as provided in this Agreement. The Secretary shall record the actions of
the Board, certify this Agreement and any related document or instrument,
certify resolutions of the Board, incumbency and other matters of the LLC, and
have such other ministerial duties as may be specified by the Board from time to
time.

      5.14  Powers of the Board; Powers of Officers.

            (a)   Subject to the provisions of this Agreement requiring the
approval of the Members, the Board's powers on behalf and in respect of the LLC
shall be all powers and privileges permitted to be exercised by managers of a
limited liability company under the Delaware Act, including, without limitation,
Section 18-402 of the Delaware Act.

            (b)   Subject to Section 5.11 hereof and except to the extent that
this Agreement requires the Board to vote on a matter, the Board may delegate
any of its powers to the Officers of the LLC or any one or more of them.

            (c)   Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5.14(b), the
Board hereby delegates to the Officers of the LLC the respective powers
delegated to comparable officers of a corporation under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, subject to the powers of a board of


                                       19
<PAGE>
directors of a corporation under such Delaware law; provided, however, that the
Board reserves the right to rescind the delegation of any such powers at any
time in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board.

      5.15  Reimbursement. The LLC shall reimburse each Manager for all
reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Manager on
behalf of the LLC according to such terms as shall be approved by the Board. The
Board's sole determination of which expenses may be reimbursed to a Manager and
the amount of such expenses shall be conclusive. Such reimbursement shall be
treated as an expense of the LLC that shall be deducted in computing Profits and
Losses and shall not be deemed to constitute a distributive share of Profits or
a distribution or return of capital to the Manager.

      5.16  Duties of Managers. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a
Manager has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto
to the LLC or to any Member, a Manager acting under this Agreement shall not be
liable to the LLC or to any Member for his or her good faith reliance on the
provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent
that they restrict the duties and liabilities of a Manager otherwise existing at
law or in equity, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties
and liabilities of such Manager.

      5.17  Fiduciary Duties.

            (a)   Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) whenever a
conflict of interest exists or arises between Managers, or (ii) whenever this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein provides that a
Manager shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and
reasonable to the LLC or any Member, the Manager shall resolve such conflict of
interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the
relative interest of each party (including his or her own interest or the
interests of his or her employer) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or
situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary
or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting
practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Manager, the
resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Manager shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein
or of any duty or obligation of the Manager at law or in equity or otherwise.

            (b)   Whenever in this Agreement a Manager is permitted or required
to make a decision (i) in his or her "discretion" or under a grant of similar
authority or latitude, the Manager shall be entitled to consider such interests
and factors as he or she desires, including his or her own interests or the
interests of his or her employer, and shall have no duty or obligation to give
any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the LLC or any other
person, or (ii) in "good faith" or under another express standard, the Manager
shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or
different standard imposed by this Agreement or other applicable law.

                      ACCOUNTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS

      6.1   Capital Contributions.

            (a)   Each Member has contributed to the capital of the LLC, or as a
result of acquiring an LLC Interest has succeeded to, the amount set forth
opposite his or its name under the column labeled "Capital Account" on Schedule
1.

            (b)   No Member shall be required to make any additional capital
contribution to the LLC.

      6.2   Capital Accounts.

            (a)   Each Member shall have a Capital Account on the books of the
LLC, which shall not bear interest.

            (b)   Except as provided in Section 12.3(a)(ii) hereof, no Member
has the right to demand a return of such Member's capital contributions (or the
balance of such Member's Capital Account). Further, no Member has the right (i)
to demand and receive any distribution from the LLC in any form other than cash
or (ii) to bring an action of partition against the LLC or its property.

      6.3   Distributions.

            (a)   Except as provided in Section 6.3(f), within 90 days after the
end of each Fiscal Year, the Board shall cause to be distributed:

                  (i)   first, to the Preferred Members in proportion to their
      respective number of Preferred Membership Points, (A) [ * ]% of all
      Revenues of the LLC for that Fiscal Year ("Preferred Member Revenue
      Share") less (B) the Excess Cash Flow Split for such Fiscal Year.

                  (ii)  second, the "Excess Cash Flow Split" shall be paid to
      the Common Members in proportion to their respective number of Common
      Membership Points beginning with distributions with respect to Fiscal Year
      1999. The Excess Cash Flow Split shall be calculated as follows:

                        A)    For the Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002,
                  multiply annual Advisory Fee revenue in 1998 by [ * ] ("Hurdle
                  Rate") taken to the "N"th power, where "N" is 1 with respect
                  to Fiscal Year 1999, "N" is 2 with respect to Fiscal Year
                  2000, "N" is 3 with respect to Fiscal Year 2001 and "N" is 4
                  with respect to Fiscal Year 2002. Annual Advisory Fee revenue
                  in 1998 shall be all 1998 advisory fee revenue earned by
                  Roxbury plus all 1998 Advisory Fee revenue earned by the LLC.
                  With respect to

<PAGE>
                  Fiscal Years 2003 and thereafter, the Excess Cash Flow Split
                  shall be computed by multiplying the Advisory Fee revenue for
                  the fifth prior Fiscal Year (for example, with respect to
                  Fiscal Year 2003, use Advisory Fee revenue for Fiscal Year
                  1998) by [*] (which is [*] 5). An amount computed hereunder is
                  "Assumed Fee Income" for such Fiscal Year.

                        B)    Subtract the Assumed Fee Income for such Fiscal
                  Year from the actual Advisory Fee revenue for such Fiscal
                  Year.

                        C)    If the calculation in B) produces a positive
                  number, multiply that difference by .[ * ]. The product of
                  this multiplication is the Excess Cash Flow Split. (See
                  examples in Exhibit B.)

                  (iii) third, Free Cash Flow shall be paid to the Common
      Members in proportion to their respective number of Common Membership
      Points for such Fiscal Year.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3(a), the Board
shall make estimated distributions described by Sections 6.3(a)(i), (ii) and
(iii) to Members each quarter. To the extent the Board makes any distributions
with respect to any Fiscal Year prior to the end of that Fiscal Year, the
priority of distributions shall be in accordance with Section 6.3(a). All such
distributions shall be deemed advances against the distributions required by
Section 6.3(a). In the event that any such distributions are determined to be
excessive, Members shall be required to repay, without interest, any excessive
distribution within thirty (30) days of being notified in writing that the
payment was excessive and must be repaid to the LLC.

            (c)   If the Board determines that it is not possible to distribute
all or part of the Preferred Member Revenue Share for any Fiscal Year because
such a distribution would materially impair the LLC's ability to operate, the
LLC shall execute a promissory note, without interest, which provides for
payment within the subsequent 12 months of the unpaid portion of any amounts the
Preferred Members should have received under Section 6.3(a)(i) and there shall
be no distributions pursuant to Section 6.3(a) or (b) for that Fiscal Year or
any subsequent Fiscal Year until such promissory note is satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the issuance of promissory
note(s) to the Preferred Members under this Section 6.3(c) for any Fiscal Year
shall not diminish or affect in any way the Preferred Members' right to a
distribution of the Preferred Member Revenue Share under Section 6.3(a)(i) for
any subsequent Fiscal Year.

            (d)   All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any provision of
any state or local tax law with respect to any payment, distribution or
allocation to the LLC or the Members shall be treated as amounts distributed to
the Members pursuant to this Section 6.3 for all purposes of this Agreement. The
LLC is authorized to withhold from distributions or with respect to allocations
to the Members and to pay over to any Federal, state or local government any
amounts required to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or any provision of any
other Federal, state or local law and shall allocate such amounts to those

            (e)   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the LLC shall not make a distribution to any Member on account
of its LLC Interest if such distribution would (i) cause such Member to have an
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, or (ii) violate Section 18-607 of the Delaware
Act or other applicable law.

            (f)   In the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the LLC, or a deemed sale of assets in connection with the liquidation
of the LLC, the proceeds thereof shall be distributed as provided in Section
12.3(a).

      6.4   Allocation of Profits and Losses.

            (a)   After giving effect to the special allocations provided in
Section 6.5 hereof, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(b) hereof,
Profits for any Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the Members as follows:

                  (i)   First, to the Preferred Members in proportion to their
      respective number of Preferred Membership Points to the extent that the
      cumulative Losses that have been allocated to the Preferred Members under
      Section 6.4(c) hereof exceed the cumulative Profits that have been
      allocated thereto under this Section 6.4(a);

                  (ii)  Second, to the Preferred Members in proportion to their
      respective number of Preferred Membership Points in an amount equal to the
      Preferred Member Revenue Share distributed to the Preferred Members or
      deferred pursuant to Section 6.3(c) hereof with respect to such Fiscal
      Year;

                  (iii) Third, to the Common Members in proportion to their
      respective number of Common Membership Points an amount equal to the
      amount distributed to such Common Members pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(ii)
      hereof; and

                  (iv)  Fourth, to the Common Members in proportion to their
      respective number of Common Membership Points for such Fiscal Year.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4(a) hereof,
Profits from the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the LLC, and
Profits from a deemed sale of assets in connection with the liquidation of the
LLC, shall be allocated among the Members as follows:

                  (i)   First, such Profits shall be allocated to the Preferred
      Members in proportion to their respective number of Preferred Membership
      Points to the extent that the cumulative Losses that have been allocated
      to the Preferred Members under Section 6.4(c) hereof exceed the cumulative
      Profits that have been allocated thereto under Section 6.4(a);

                  (ii)  Second, an amount of such Profits equal to two-thirds
      (2/3) of the Purchase Price (as such term is defined in the LLC Interest
      Purchase Agreement) shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion
      to their respective numbers of Common Membership Points; and



                                       23
<PAGE>
                  (iii) Thereafter, an amount of such Profits equal to the
      Historic Preferred Share of such Profits (after reduction for the amounts
      allocated to Members under Sections 6.4(b)(i) and (ii) above) shall be
      allocated to the Preferred Members in proportion to their respective
      numbers of Preferred Membership Points and the remainder of such Profits
      shall be allocated to the Common Members in proportion to their respective
      numbers of Common Membership Points.

For purposes of this Section 6.4(b), the "Historic Preferred Share" shall be
equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the cumulative amount distributed
or distributable to the Preferred Member pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(i) hereof
for the five Fiscal Years (or, if fewer, the number of completed Fiscal Years)
immediately preceding the year in which the sale or deemed sale of assets occurs
and the denominator of which is the cumulative amount of all distributions made
to Members in accordance with Section 6.3 hereof for the same period.

            (c)   All Losses shall be allocated to the Preferred Members in
proportion to their respective number of Preferred Membership Points. However,
no allocation shall be made under this Section 6.4(c) to the extent it causes a
Preferred Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

      6.5   Special Allocations.

            (a)   If and to the extent that any employee or Principal of the LLC
or an Affiliate recognizes or is deemed to recognize any item of income or gain
pursuant to Code Section 83 by virtue of any transaction or deemed transaction
between any Member and such employee, then any resulting item of loss recognized
by the LLC or deduction to which the LLC is entitled shall be specially
allocated to such Member.

            (b)   If and to the extent that any employee or Principal of the LLC
receives a payment from Roxbury pursuant to the Special Profit Sharing Pool,
then any resulting deduction to which the LLC is entitled shall be specially
allocated to Roxbury.

            (c)   The provisions of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Code Section 704(b) relating to the qualified income offset, minimum gain
chargeback, minimum gain chargeback with respect to nonrecourse debt, the
allocation of nonrecourse deductions and the allocation of items of deduction,
loss or expenditure relating to nonrecourse debt are hereby incorporated by this
reference and shall be applied to the allocation of items of income, gain, loss
or deduction of the LLC in the manner provided in such Treasury Regulations.
However, the Members do not intend that the "deficit restoration obligation"
described in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) of the Treasury Regulations be
incorporated by reference herein.

            (d)   In the event that items of income, gain, loss or deduction are
allocated to one or more Members pursuant to Section 6.5(c) above, subsequent
items of income, gain, loss or deduction will first be allocated (subject to the
provisions of Section 6.5(c)) to the Members in a manner designed to result in
each Member having a Capital Account balance equal to what it would have been
had the original allocation of Profits or Losses, or items thereof pursuant to
Section 6.5(c) not occurred.



                                       24

      6.6   Tax Allocations: Code Section 704(c).

            (a)   In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any
property contributed to the capital of the LLC shall, solely for tax purposes,
be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between
the adjusted basis of such property to the LLC for federal income tax purposes
and its initial Carrying Value at the time of its contribution to the LLC.

            (b)   Allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect
to any asset revalued in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Code Section
704 shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset
for federal income tax purposes and its Carrying Value in the same manner as
under Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and as
required by Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) of the Treasury Regulations.

            (c)   Any elections or other decisions relating to allocations
described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 6.6 shall be made by the
Members in any manner that reasonably reflects the purposes and intention of
this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.6 are solely for purposes
of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, nor in any way be taken
into account in computing, any Member's Capital Account or share of Profits,
Losses or other items or distributions pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement.

      6.7   Proration for Partial Years. In the event (a) the Membership Points
of any Common Member shall be adjusted, by Transfer or otherwise, during any
Fiscal Year or (b) any Common Member shall be admitted to the LLC during any
Fiscal Year, any distributions and any allocations to such Member pursuant to
this Article 6 shall be made based on the average of the Member's Membership
Points for such Fiscal Year, determined on a monthly basis. For example, if in
the months of January through July of a Fiscal Year (i.e., seven months) a
Common Member owned nine Membership Points, and in the months of August through
December of such Fiscal Year (i.e., five months) the Member owned three
Membership Points, the distributions and allocations to such Member pursuant to
this Article 6 would be based on an LLC Interest calculated as follows:

                       (7 x 9) + (5 x 3) = 6.5 Membership
                       -----------------       Points

                TRANSFER OF LLC INTERESTS, PUT AND CALL OPTIONS,
             MANDATORY PURCHASES AND ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS

      7.1   Assignability of Interests.

            (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Article 7, no LLC
Interest of a Member may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated,
gifted, exchanged, optioned, liened or encumbered (each, a "Transfer") and no
Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be binding upon the LLC.



                                       25
<PAGE>
            (b)   A Member may transfer all or any portion of its or his LLC
Interest (i) to any one or more Permitted Transferees or Related Entities who
agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (ii) upon
obtaining the prior approval of the Board in accordance with Section 5.11
hereof, to any other Person who agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the transferring Member shall retain the right
to vote with respect to LLC Interests Transferred unless (A) the transferee is
WTI, WTC, Wilmington or an officer of the LLC, (B) the Transfer is pursuant to
an Option Agreement, or (C) the transferee is approved by the Board as a Voting
Member.

            (c)   In addition to Transfers permitted under Section 7.1(b),
certain Members, including Permitted Transferees of Principals, may exercise
Puts in accordance with Section 7.2 and certain Members are required to make
sales in accordance with Section 7.3, in accordance with the terms of such
Sections.

            (d)   Until December 31, 2003, Roxbury may grant options on LLC
Interests it owns to employees of the LLC in Roxbury's sole and absolute
discretion pursuant to a written Option Agreement if: (i) the aggregate exercise
price to purchase the LLC Interests subject to the option is not less than the
proportionate share of LLC Value represented by such LLC Interests determined on
the date of the grant using a multiple of six in determining LLC Value; (ii) not
more than one-third of the option shall vest before the end of the first year
after grant, not more than two-thirds of the option shall vest before the end of
the second year after grant, and not more than 100% of the option shall vest
before the end of the third year after grant; (iii) the option does not become
exercisable before the third anniversary of its date of grant (although an
option may become exercisable prior to such third anniversary (A) in the event
of death, Disability or Retirement of the option holder, (B) on termination of
the employment of the option holder without Cause or (c) on resignation by the
option holder for Good Reason); (iv) the option holder executes an employment
contract in a form acceptable to the LLC at the time of, or prior to, the
execution of the Option Agreement; (v) the option holder exercising the option
must sign this Agreement as a condition of exercise; and (vi) the optionee makes
representations and warranties to the LLC comparable to those contained in
Section 13.5 on the date of grant of the option and on the date of each exercise
thereof.

      7.2   Put Options.

            (a)   On or before February 28 of each year, the LLC shall notify
all Members of the LLC Value as of December 31 of the immediately preceding
year.

            (b)   Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
Section 7.2, each Principal and Roxbury may exercise an option to sell to
Wilmington all or any portion of his or its LLC Interest (each such Put to
Wilmington being referred to as a "Put"). Upon exercise of a Put under this
Section 7.2(b), Wilmington shall thereupon become obligated to purchase the LLC
Interest as to which the Put has been exercised.

            (c)   Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.2(b) to the
contrary, unless otherwise agreed to by Wilmington: (i) neither a Principal nor
Roxbury may exercise a Put prior to


                                       26
<PAGE>
the fifth anniversary of the later of the Commencement Date or the date hereof;
(ii) Puts may not be exercised in any Fiscal Year with respect to LLC Interests
representing more than 25% of the Common Membership Points of the LLC then
outstanding; (iii) each Founding Principal may not exercise Puts in any Fiscal
Year exceeding 50% of his High Water Mark and any other Principal may not
exercise Puts in any Fiscal Year exceeding 20% of his High Water Mark; and (iv)
a Put may not be exercised with respect to LLC Interests acquired on exercise of
an Option Agreement unless such LLC Interests have been held for at least six
months (other than after a Change of Control or in an amount with a Put Price
equal to the dollar amount of the maximum federal, state and local tax rates
applicable to the exercise of such Option Agreement). If, in any Fiscal Year,
Puts are exercised with respect to more than 25% of the outstanding Common
Membership Points, then each such Member shall be entitled to exercise Puts
equal to the product of (x) 25%, (y) the Common Membership Points of the LLC
then outstanding and (z) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Common
Membership Points relating to the LLC Interests for which a Put is sought to be
exercised by the Member (after giving effect to Section 7.2(c)(iii)) and the
denominator of which is the total Common Membership Points relating to LLC
Interests for which Puts are sought to be exercised by all Members (after giving
effect to Section 7.2(c)(iii)). Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations of
this Section 7.2(c), Roxbury may exercise a Put following an Extraordinary Event
with respect to a Founding Principal or the exercise of a Wilmington Call with
respect to the LLC Interests of a Founding Principal; provided, however, that
the number of Common Membership Points that are the subject of such Put shall
not exceed the Derivative Share of such Founding Principal (a "Special Roxbury
Put"). A Special Roxbury Put shall not be included in determining whether the
limitations set forth above in this Section 7.2(c) have been satisfied.

            (d)   A Member may exercise a Put if, on or before March 15 of any
year, Wilmington receives an irrevocable notice of exercise of the Put to
Wilmington substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto (the "Put Notice")
stating that it or he is electing to exercise the Put and specifying the LLC
Interest to be sold pursuant to the Put. On or before the first day of April
after receipt of a Put Notice (or the next succeeding Business Day if such April
1 is not a Business Day), and subject to the limitations set forth in Section
7.2(c) hereof, Wilmington shall purchase from the Member the LLC Interest set
forth in the Put Notice. At the closing of the exercise of a Put, Wilmington
shall deliver the Put Price to the Member by certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds against delivery of such documents or instruments of
transfer as Wilmington may reasonably request.

            (e)   On the last day of the month in which a Put is exercised by a
Member, such Member shall cease to have any rights as a Member with respect to
the LLC Interest so Put other than (i) the right to receive the Put Price on the
Purchase Closing Date and (ii) the right to receive distributions and
allocations with respect to such LLC Interest through the Purchase Closing Date.
For example, this means that the LLC Interests to be purchased shall not have
any voting rights during such period.

            (f)   In the event of a Change of Control, a Member may send a Put
Notice at any time during the fifteen months following the Change of Control,
and the restrictions of Section 7.2(c)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to
such Put, in which case the LLC Value shall be determined as of December 31
immediately prior to the date of the Put Notice and the Purchase Closing Date


                                       27
<PAGE>
shall be 60 days following delivery of the Put Notice (or the next succeeding
Business Day if such date is not a Business Day).

      7.3   Purchase on Occurrence of an Extraordinary Event or a Roxbury
Extraordinary Event; Wilmington Call.

            (a)   The provisions set forth in Section 7.3(b) shall apply to the
purchase and sale of an LLC Interest of a Principal or a Related Holder of such
Principal following the Principal's (i) death; (ii) Disability; (iii)
Retirement; (iv) termination of employment by the LLC without Cause; (v)
voluntary termination of employment with the LLC for Good Reason; (vi) a
transfer of LLC Interests required by operation of law; or (vii) other
involuntary transfers of an LLC Interest (all hereafter referred to as
"Extraordinary Events"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an
Extraordinary Event occurs that causes or permits a Person to become a Principal
for the first time as a result of accelerated exercisability of vested options
under an Option Agreement, the provisions of this Section 7.3(a) shall be
effective immediately as if such Person were a Principal at the time the
Extraordinary Event occurred. The provisions set forth in Section 7.3(b) shall
also apply to the purchase and sale of all of the LLC Interests held by Roxbury
once the last Founding Principal ceases to serve as an employee of the LLC for
whatever reason, which event shall be deemed a "Roxbury Extraordinary Event."

            (b)   In the event of an Extraordinary Event or a Roxbury
Extraordinary Event, Wilmington shall be obligated to purchase from such
Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, and such Principal Entities
or Roxbury, as the case may be, shall be obligated to sell to Wilmington, all of
such Principal Entities' or Roxbury's LLC Interests at a purchase price equal to
the Put Price thereof.

                  (i)   If the Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary
Event occurs on or before December 31, 1998, the Purchase Closing Date shall be
April 1, 1999 (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding
Business Day). On such Purchase Closing Date, Wilmington shall deliver to the
Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, the Initial Put Price by
certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds against delivery
of such documents or instruments of transfer transferring the purchased LLC
Interests to Wilmington as may be reasonably requested by Wilmington. In
addition, in the event of an Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event
that occurs on or before December 31, 1998, on April 3, 2000 (or if such day is
not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), Wilmington shall deliver
to such Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, the Subsequent Put
Price, if any, by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

                  (ii)  If the Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary
Event occurs between January 1 and June 30 of any year after 1998, the Purchase
Closing Date under this Section 7.3(b) shall be on April 1 (or if April 1 is not
a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) of the year following the year
of the date of the Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event, at which
time Wilmington shall deliver to such Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case
may be, the purchase price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds. If the Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event
occurs between July 1 and December 31 of any year after 1998, the Purchase
Closing Date under this Section 7.3(b) shall be on April 1 (or if


                                       28
<PAGE>
April 1 is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) of the second
year following the year of the date of the Extraordinary Event or Roxbury
Extraordinary Event, at which time Wilmington shall deliver to such Principal
Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, the purchase price by certified check
or wire transfer of immediately available funds. With respect to any
Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event that occurs after December
31, 1998, on a date mutually agreed between Wilmington and the selling Principal
Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, but in any event not later than 60 days
after the date on which such Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event
occurs, Wilmington shall deliver to the Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the
case may be, the Advance Payment by certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds against delivery of such documents or instruments of
transfer as may be reasonably requested by Wilmington transferring 75% of the
LLC Interests to be purchased pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) to Wilmington. In
addition, on the Purchase Closing Date, such Principal Entities or Roxbury, as
the case may be, shall deliver to Wilmington such documents or instruments of
transfer as may be reasonably requested by Wilmington transferring the remaining
25% of the LLC Interests to be purchased pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) to
Wilmington, and (i) if the Put Price exceeds the Advance Payment, Wilmington
shall deliver to such Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, the
excess of the Put Price over the Advance Payment by certified check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds, and (ii) if the Advance Payment exceeds
the Put Price, such Principal Entities or Roxbury, as the case may be, shall
deliver to Wilmington the excess of the Advance Payment over the Put Price by
certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds.

            (c)   Within 90 days following the termination of a Principal's
employment with the LLC (other than because of an Extraordinary Event),
Wilmington may exercise the right to purchase from such Principal Entities all
or a portion of such Principal Entities' LLC Interests (a "Wilmington Call").
The purchase price for any LLC Interest subject to a Wilmington Call shall be
the Call Price.

            (d)   A Wilmington Call may be exercised by delivering to each
appropriate Person a written notice signed by Wilmington in substantially the
form of Exhibit E hereto (the "Wilmington Call Notice") stating that it is
exercising the Wilmington Call and any LLC Interest with respect to which the
Wilmington Call is being exercised. On April 1 of the year following the year in
which the Wilmington Call Notice is delivered (or if such April 1 is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), each Person whose LLC Interest
is subject to the Wilmington Call shall sell to Wilmington the LLC Interest (or
portion thereof) set forth in the Wilmington Call Notice. At the closing of the
exercise by Wilmington of a Wilmington Call, Wilmington shall deliver the
purchase price by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds against delivery of such documents or instruments of transfer as may be
reasonably requested by Wilmington.

            (e)   On the last day of the month in which an Extraordinary Event
or a Roxbury Extraordinary Event occurs or in which a Wilmington Call is
exercised, each Person whose LLC Interests have been called or who has
experienced the Roxbury Extraordinary Event or the Extraordinary Event, or his
estate, as the case may be, shall cease to have any rights as a Member with
respect to the LLC Interests being purchased, other than (i) the right to
receive the Advance Payment, the Initial Put Price, the Subsequent Put Price or
the Call Price, as the case may be, and (ii) the right to receive distributions
and allocations with respect to such LLC Interests through the


                                       29
<PAGE>
date on which such LLC Interests are transferred to Wilmington. For example,
this means that the LLC Interests to be purchased shall not have any voting
rights during such period.

      7.4   LLC Interests Subject to Option Rights. If any LLC Interests
purchased by Wilmington pursuant to Sections 7.2 or 7.3 are subject to the
rights of an individual who has been granted the option to purchase such LLC
Interests pursuant to an Option Agreement, that option holder shall retain all
rights granted by that Option Agreement.

      7.5   Substitute Members. Any Transfer of LLC Interests (other than a
transfer by WTI to a Permitted Transferee, a transfer pursuant to this Article 7
or a transfer as a result of the exercise of rights to acquire LLC Interests
under an Option Agreement) shall, nevertheless, not entitle the transferee,
unless already a Member, to become a Member or to be entitled to exercise or
receive any of the rights, powers or benefits of a Member other than the right
to share in such profits and losses, to receive distributions and allocations of
income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or similar item to which the transferor
Member would otherwise be entitled, to the extent assigned, unless the
transferor Member designates, in a written instrument delivered to the Board,
its transferee to become a substitute Member and the Board, in its sole and
absolute discretion, consents to the admission of such transferee as a
Non-voting Member; provided, however, that such transferee shall not become a
substitute Member without having first executed an instrument reasonably
satisfactory to the Board accepting and agreeing to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including a counterpart signature page to this Agreement, and
without having paid to the LLC a fee sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses
of the LLC in connection with such transferee's admission as a substitute
Member, and provided further that, upon the admission of such transferee as
provided herein, such admission shall be reflected upon the books and records of
the LLC, including Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

      7.6   Recognition of Transfer by LLC. No Transfer of a Member's LLC
Interest, or any part thereof, that is in violation of this Article 7 shall be
valid or effective, and neither the LLC nor the Members shall recognize the same
for the purpose of making distributions pursuant to Articles 6 or 12 hereof with
respect to such transferred LLC Interest or part thereof. Neither the LLC, any
member of the Board nor any Member shall incur any liability as a result of
refusing to make any such distributions to the transferee of any such invalid
Transfer.

      7.7   Effective Date of Transfer; Order of Puts, Calls and Purchases Under
Section 7.3(b).

            (a)   Any valid Transfer of a Member's LLC Interest, or part
thereof, pursuant to Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.5 shall be effective as of the
close of business on the last day of the calendar month in which such Transfer
occurs. Upon the valid transfer of a Member's LLC Interest, such Person shall
cease to be a Member, and the books and records of the LLC, including Schedule 1
to this Agreement, shall reflect such event.

            (b)   With respect to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 hereof, the first to
occur of (i) the delivery of a Put Notice under Section 7.2(d) or (f), (ii) the
occurrence of the first Extraordinary Event or Roxbury Extraordinary Event under
Section 7.3(a) or (iii) the delivery of a Wilmington Call Notice under Section
7.3(d), shall govern the rights and obligations of the parties with respect


                                       30
<PAGE>
to the Common Interests subject to the Put Notice or the Wilmington Call Notice,
or the Common Interests to be purchased under Section 7.3(b), as the case may
be.

      7.8   Indemnification. In the case of a Transfer or attempted Transfer of
an LLC Interest that has not received the consents required by this Article 7,
the parties engaging or attempting to engage in such Transfer shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the LLC and the
other Members from all costs, liabilities and damages that any of such
indemnified Persons may incur (including, without limitation, incremental tax
liability and lawyers' fees and expenses) as a result of such Transfer or
attempted Transfer and efforts to enforce the indemnity granted hereby.

      7.9   Issuance of Additional LLC Interests.

            (a)   Subject to Sections 5.11, 7.1 and 7.5 hereof, the Board may
admit new Members to the LLC, issue additional LLC Interests and, pursuant to a
written plan adopted and approved by the Board under Section 5.11 (an "Incentive
Plan") issue Common Interests, or grant options to purchase Common Interests. As
a condition to the admission of a new Member, such Member must become a party to
this Agreement by signing a counterpart signature page to this Agreement.

            (b)   Upon the issuance of additional LLC Interests to a Member, the
LLC shall make the appropriate revisions to Schedule 1 hereto to reflect the

claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings with respect to which such
Officer or Manager is alleged to have not met the applicable standard of conduct
or is alleged to have acted or failed to act in a manner which, if such

determined. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation with respect to such
assets shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with Article 6 as
though the property were sold for its Fair Market Value and distribution of any
such assets in kind to a Member shall be considered a distribution of an amount
equal to the assets' Fair Market Value for purposes of Article 6 and this

other than cash upon dissolution and termination of the LLC.

contributions and, if the assets of the LLC remaining after payment of or due
provision for all debts, liabilities and obligations of the LLC are insufficient
to return such capital contributions, the Members shall have no recourse against
the LLC or any other Member.
