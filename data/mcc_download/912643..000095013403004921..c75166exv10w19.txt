                   2003 COMPENSATION PLAN FOR THOMAS SPARRVIK


The main focus this year is to grow the company and continue on the path of
profitability. The main challenge will be to continue to motivate the staff
while located in San Diego. This reward system intends to motivate you to
fulfill both the Company tasks and, in the long term, create shareholder value
for all shareholders of KMC.

The existing contract between us will remain in effect as a base contract;
however, your monthly base salary will continue to be $2000/month effective
01/01/03, and you will not be part of the KMC benefit plans:

A `per quarter' bonus will be paid to you, based on the following quarterly
Operating Profit:

        o    If less than $150K, then $0/Qtr.

        o    If more than $150K, but less than $399K, then $5,000/Qtr.

        o    If more than $400K, but less than $600K, then $7,500/Qtr.

        o    If more than $600K, but less than $900K, then $10,000/Qtr.

        o    If more than $900K, then $15,000/Qtr.

A `year end' bonus of $20,000 will be paid to you if the 2003 Annual Operating
Profit for KMC exceeds $1.2 million.

A `year end' bonus will be paid to you based on the following 2003 annual
Revenue results:

        o    If at least $15 million, then $7,500.

        o    If between $15 million and $18 million, then an additional
             $12,500, prorated.

        o    If $18 million or more, then $20,000.

Before the bonuses are paid, financial results must be received and approved by
the Compensation Committee Chairman.

No Q3 or Q4 bonus will be paid if the 2003 YTD cumulative Operating Profit at
the end of these quarters is less than $800K.

This agreement will be added to your existing contract and will be in effect Q1
through Q4, 2003.
