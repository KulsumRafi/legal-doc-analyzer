equal to the product of any deductions disallowed because of the inclusion of
the Gross-up Payment in Executive&#146;s adjusted gross income and the highest
applicable marginal rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in
which the Gross-up Payment is to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it
shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but
that the Executive, after taking into account the Payments and the Gross-Up
Payment, would not receive net after-tax proceeds of at least $50,000 (taking
into account income and employment taxes and any Excise Tax) in excess of the
net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an elimination of the
Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payments, in the aggregate, to an
amount (the
&#147;Reduced Amount&#148;) such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any
Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the
Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced in the manner elected by the
Executive to the Reduced Amount. For purposes of determining the amount of the
Gross-up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to (i)&nbsp;pay federal income taxes
at the highest marginal rates of federal income taxation for the calendar year
in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made, (ii)&nbsp;pay applicable state and
local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation for the calendar
year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction
in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state
and local taxes and (iii)&nbsp;have otherwise allowable deductions for federal
income tax purposes at least equal to those disallowed because of the increase
of the Gross-up Payment in the Executive&#146;s adjusted gross income.

required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by the Company and the Company shall enter into any agreement
requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with the performance of the
services hereunder. The Gross-up Payment under this Section&nbsp;4 with respect to
any Payments shall be made no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days following such
Payments. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by
Executive, it shall furnish
Executive with a written opinion to such effect, and to the effect that failure
to report the Excise Tax, if any, on Executive&#146;s applicable federal income tax
return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.
The Determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and
Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999
of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Gross-Up
Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made
(&#147;Underpayment&#148;) or Gross-up Payments are made by the Company which should not
have been made (&#147;Overpayment&#148;), consistent with the calculations required to be
made hereunder. In the event that the Executive thereafter is required to make
payment of any additional Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the
amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment
(together with interest at the rate provided in Section&nbsp;1274(b)(2)(B) of the
Code) shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive.
In the event the amount of the Gross-up Payment exceeds the amount necessary
to reimburse the Executive for his Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall
determine the amount of the Overpayment that has been made and any such
Overpayment (together with interest at the rate provided in Section&nbsp;1274(b)(2)
of the Code) shall be promptly paid by Executive to or for the benefit of the
Company. Executive shall cooperate, to the extent his expenses are reimbursed
by the Company, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with
any contests or disputes with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with
the Excise Tax.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee are each aware of conditions in
the insurance industry that have affected and may continue to affect the
Company&#146;s ability to obtain appropriate directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability
insurance on an economically acceptable basis;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee are also aware of the exposure to
litigation of officers, directors, employees and agents of corporations as such
persons exercise their duties to the Company;

highly qualified and experienced persons such as the Indemnitee;

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Indemnitee desires to serve or to continue to serve the
Company as a director, officer, employee or agent, including service at the
request of the Company as a director, officer or trustee of another
corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for so long as the
Company continues to provide on an acceptable basis indemnification against
certain liabilities and expenses which may be incurred by the Indemnitee.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

his activities as a director, officer or employee of the Company or as a person
who is serving or has served at the request of the Company (&#147;Agent&#148;) as a
director, officer or trustee of another corporation, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines,
and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by him
(&#147;Expenses&#148;) in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action,
suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a &#147;Proceeding&#148;), to which he was, is, or is threatened to be made a party by
reason of facts which include his being or having been such a director,
officer, employee, or agent, to the extent of the highest and most advantageous
to the Indemnitee, as determined by the Indemnitee, of one or any combination
of the following:

time obtained or retained by the Company; except that any payments made under
an insurance policy shall reduce the obligations of the Company hereunder.

Company for such Expenses. That portion of Expenses which represents
attorneys&#146; fees and other costs incurred in defending any Proceeding shall be
paid by the Company within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of its receipt of such request,
together with such reasonable documentation evidencing the amount and nature of
such Expenses as the Company shall require, subject to its also receiving such
undertaking.

(the &#147;Escrow Reserve&#148;); provided, however, that the terms of any such Escrow
Reserve may provide that the cash, securities or letter of credit available
therefore shall only be utilized for the indemnification or advancement of
expenses provided for herein in the event that there shall have occurred within
the preceding five years a Change in Control of the Company, as defined below.
For purposes of this Agreement, a &#147;Change in Control&#148; of the Company shall have
occurred if at any time during the Term (as hereafter defined) any of the
following events shall occur:

director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder, partner, incorporator or
liquidator of a Subsidiary of the Company, or serves or served at the request
of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder, partner,
incorporator or liquidator of or in any other capacity for any other

in defending any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by
the Company promptly upon demand by such person and, if any such demand is made
in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding,
promptly upon receipt by the Company of an undertaking of such person to repay

the rights provided to any person by this by-law shall survive the termination
of such person as any such director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder,

request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, member, stockholder,
partner, incorporator or liquidator of or in any other capacity for any other
