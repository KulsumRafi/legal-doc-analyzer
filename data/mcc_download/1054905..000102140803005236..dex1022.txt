1.    NAME OF PARTIES

      EMPLOYER:                  The Associated Octel Company Limited

      EMPLOYEE:                  Sharon Todd

2.    Your Job Title is:         Corporate Development Director

3.    Your Normal Place of Work will be:    Global House
                                            Bailey Lane
                                            Manchester M90 4AA

      You will initially be employed at our European Headquarters in Global
      House, but as a term of your employment you may also be required to work
      at or from any other of the Company's establishments. You may also be
      transferred or seconded between establishments when necessary as required
      by business needs. Whilst your Contract of Employment provides for such
      transfer or secondment the Company will give careful and sympathetic
      consideration to your personal circumstances and career interests.

4.    REMUNERATION

      i)     Your basic salary will be (Pounds)80,001 per annum paid monthly in
             advance by credit transfer. This will be reviewed six months after
             starting and every March thereafter.

      ii)    You will be entitled to participate in the Senior Management Bonus
             Plan In your case, the target pay-out would be 40% of basic salary,
             subject to Company and personal performance. The Plan normally runs
             from 1st January to 31st December.

5.    HOURS OF WORK

      The normal hours of work are 38 hours per week exclusive of lunch breaks.

      The Company reserves the right to vary starting and finishing times either
      on a temporary or continuous basis. Any permanent departure from the
      normal working week will be notified in writing. However, irregular
      variations in working hours undertaken in response to operational needs
      will not be formally notified.

      For senior managers it is recognised that the nature of their roles will
      involve occasionally working extended hours, either during the working
      week or at weekends. This is accepted as a normal part of the working life
      of a global business and does not warrant either extra payment or time off
      in lieu. Where a specific business reason requires working on a public
      holiday, time off in lieu on a day to day basis may be granted by a member
      of the OMB.

6.    COMPANY CAR

      You will be provided with a fully expensed Company car, including private
      fuel. You may take a cash equivalent in lieu of a car. Currently the

      in Human Resources of your preferred option.

<PAGE>

7.    HOLIDAYS

      For a full year your holiday entitlement is 25 days per annum. The holiday
      year runs from 1st March to the last day in February the following year.

      Service Related Holidays
      You shall be entitled to additional holiday entitlement dependent upon
      completed years of continuous service with the Company on the last day of
      February prior to the holiday year concerned with the following scale:

      Completed Years' Service                     Additional Holidays
      ------------------------                     -------------------
                  5                                       1 day
                  10                                      2 days
                  15                                      3 days

      You must arrange the timing of your holidays with your manager so that
      adequate manning cover can be maintained. The minimum holiday that may be
      taken at any time shall normally be one full day. However, you may be
      permitted to take up to 10 half day holidays in any year, or to depart
      from the normal pattern of holidays described above, provided your manager
      is satisfied that such arrangement is in no way detrimental to operational
      needs or to the reasonable opportunity for other staff to take a holiday.

      The Company may, if necessary, nominate up to 1 day out of each year's
      entitlement when holiday must be taken. This may be on a general or
      departmental basis and advance notice will be given wherever possible. Any
      holiday entitlement outstanding at the end of the holiday year will
      normally be forfeited. However, in exceptional circumstances approval to
      carry over part of the entitlement from one holiday year to the next may
      be granted by the appropriate Octel Management Board Member, on the
      recommendation of the Department Manager. During the months of January and
      February each year, staff may bring forward up to 5 days entitlement from
      the ensuring holiday year, by agreement with their manager.

8.    NOTICE

      The Company has the right to terminate your employment by giving you
      twelve months notice in writing. This will not apply in the event of gross
      misconduct. You are required to give the Company six months notice in
      writing of termination of employment. Written notice of termination
      addressed to your manager, may be given on any day and will begin from the
      start of the following day. Failure to give proper notice constitutes a
      breach of contractual obligations.

      The Company will normally require dismissed employees to terminate
      forthwith and may give pay in lieu of notice. Staff may, however, be
      summarily dismissed (i.e. without pay in lieu of notice) when the Company
      is satisfied that an individual is guilty of gross misconduct.

      Should the need arise for redundancies to be declared, the Company
      reserves the right to implement a system for selection based upon
      principles other than `last-in, first-out'.

9.    HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

      You will be entitled to the following healthcare benefits:

      Group Accident Insurance
      You will be covered by the Company's Group Accident Insurance. The
      Company's Insurance Department will be writing to you giving details of
      the Scheme.

<PAGE>

      Octel Healthcare Scheme
      You are entitled to membership at Company cost. This is a taxable benefit.

10.   SICKNESS ABSENCE

      The Company's scheme entitles you to payment of salary in respect of any
      period of up to one month's absence from work because of certified
      sickness or incapacity.

11.   MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS

      Employees may be required to submit to medical examinations, including
      biological sampling, which are either statutorily required, or are
      considered by the Company's Medical Officer to be necessary in connection
      with their duties.

      Any other investigations will be conducted on a purely voluntary basis.

      Should an employee, at any time, have been in contact with a person
      suffering from an infectious disease, they should consult the Company's
      Medical Officer before returning to work.

12.   PENSION

      The Company operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension for the
      benefit of employees.

      Membership of this scheme is available to all U.K. employees up to the
      Company's normal retirement date.

      The main feature of the plan comprises 5% of salary from employees and 5%
      from the Company. The Company will also match extra contributions from
      employees up to a maximum of 3% (up to age 35) and 5% (over the age of
      35), dependent on Inland Revenue limits.

      In recognition of your seniority, the Company will also make an extra 3.5%
      payment into the Plan; therefore making a minimum Company contribution of
      8.5%.

13.   INVENTIONS

      If at any time whilst employed by the Company a member of staff should
      invent, discover or devise individually or jointly with another person(s)
      any invention, design or improvement (collectively called `the
      invention'), then the Company's and Employee's rights to such invention(s)
      are governed by current patent legislation.

      The legislation provides for employee inventions whether patentable or
      not, made in the course of an individual's normal duties to belong to the
      Company. In such cases the employee must promptly disclose the invention
      to the Company. Inventions not connected with an employee's work or duties
      belong exclusively to the employee. A further provision generally entitles
      employees to compensation when an invention they have made and which
      belongs to the Company is patented and that patent is of outstanding
      benefit to the Company.

      The Company's Patents Committee, in reviewing the particulars of
      employees' inventions, will take due account of the statutory provisions
      relating to inventions, Patents and Trade Marks. If you need further
      guidance on this section please consult your manager.
