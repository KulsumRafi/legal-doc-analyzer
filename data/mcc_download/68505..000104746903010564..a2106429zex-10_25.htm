<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment to the Severance Protection Agreement entered into as of December&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>21</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, 1999, by and between
General Instrument Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (the "Corporation"), and Thomas&nbsp;J. Lynch (the "Executive") (such agreement, the "Severance Protection Agreement") is among the
Corporation, the Executive, and Motorola,&nbsp;Inc. ("Motorola") and is dated as of December&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>21</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Corporation, Motorola and Lucerne Acquisition Corp. have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September&nbsp;14, 1999 (such agreement, as amended from
time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola in a merger (the "Merger"); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Executive is employed by the Corporation; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Corporation and Motorola wish to ensure that they will continue to receive the benefit of the Executive's services following the Merger, and to provide for the terms and
conditions of the Executive's employment following the Merger, and the Executive is willing to remain so employed on such terms and conditions; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retention Program.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;As soon as practical after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), but in no event later than ten business days thereafter, Motorola shall grant the Executive stock options with respect to 65,000 shares (the "Closing Options") with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, and 7,500 shares of restricted stock (the "Closing Shares"), in each case pursuant to the Motorola Incentive Plan of 1998 (the
"Motorola Incentive Plan") subject to appropriate adjustment as to the number of shares if an event described in Section&nbsp;3.3 of the Motorola Incentive Plan (an "Adjustment Event") occurs on or
before the date of grant. The Closing Options shall be scheduled to vest in four equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, and all of the Closing Shares shall
vest on the second
anniversary of the day on which the Effective Time occurs, in each case subject to the Executive's continued employment until the date of vesting, and the Closing Options and the Closing Shares shall
otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions of the Motorola Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the time when Motorola makes its annual stock option grants to executives for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, Motorola
shall grant the Executive stock options with respect to 15,000 shares pursuant to the Motorola Incentive Plan or any successor thereto, subject to appropriate adjustment as to the number of shares if
an Adjustment Event occurs on or before the date of grant. Such options shall be scheduled to vest in four equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to
the Executive's continued employment until the date of vesting, shall have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, and shall otherwise be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Motorola Incentive Plan or such successor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Executive remains employed by Motorola or one of its Subsidiaries (including without limitation the Corporation) from the date on which the Effective Time occurs
through the second anniversary thereof, or sooner terminates employment as a result of death or Disability, the Executive shall receive a one-time Retention Cash Bonus equal to $385,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change in Control; Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged and agreed that the approval of the Merger by the Corporation's
stockholders will be a "Change in Control" as defined in Section&nbsp;13.7 of the Severance Protection Agreement, and that if such approval occurs, no subsequent event shall be deemed to be a Change
in Control for purposes of the Severance Protection Agreement. As a result, if such approval occurs, then notwithstanding any provision of the Severance Protection Agreement: (i)&nbsp;the "Term"
shall mean the period ending on the second anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and shall not be further renewed or extended except by written agreement among the parties
hereto; and (ii)&nbsp;each reference in the Severance Protection Agreement to a Change in Control shall be deemed to refer to such stockholder approval and to no other event. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Transfer.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged and agreed that the Executive may, at and/or from time to time after
the Effective Time, be transferred to the employment of Motorola or a Subsidiary of Motorola, and that in connection with any such transfer, the Corporation may assign to the employing entity its
rights, and cause the employing entity to assume its obligations, under the Severance Protection Agreement and this Amendment. In such event, references to the Corporation in the Severance Protection
Agreement and this Amendment shall be deemed to refer to such employing entity. </FONT></P>

Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereof, reading in its entirety as follows: "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Executive hereafter becomes
a party to any agreement with Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries providing for severance pay and/or benefits upon a termination of employment upon, after or in connection with a change of control

payments and benefits to which the Executive would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2 shall be offset by the Subsequent Severance so that there is no duplication thereof." </FONT></P>
