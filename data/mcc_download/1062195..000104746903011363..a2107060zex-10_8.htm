<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive has a target bonus compensation of $150,000 (the "Target Bonus"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty
percent (50%) of the Target Bonus shall be paid on achievement of revenue objectives of the Company for the Term (the "Revenue Bonus"). The Revenue Bonus shall be paid monthly not
more than 45&nbsp;days following the end of each month and shall be calculated in the following manner: 50% of the Target Bonus divided by 2002 Revenue Goal for the Company equals the Revenue
Percentage Calculator ("Calculator"). The Calculator shall be applied to the actual revenue generated by the Company in the given month to determine the monthly bonus. Total payments for Revenue Bonus
shall be not less than $75,000 nor more than $112,500 per calendar year. The Revenue Bonus shall be paid at a minimum of $6,250 per month to the extent that total cumulative payments of Revenue Bonus
to Executive in any calendar year are less than $75,000; once the cumulative amount of Revenue Bonus payments equals $75,000 in any calendar year, no further payments shall be made except to the
extent that actual revenue exceeds the Annual Revenue Goal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty
percent (50%) of the Target Bonus shall be paid in relation to the EBITA goal of the Company for the Term. The actual EBITA as calculated by the Company at the end of each calendar
year shall be divided by the EBITA goal for the Term to determine the EBITA Percentage. If the EBITA Percentage falls within the range of 80-120%, the Executive shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) of the Target Bonus multiplied by the EBITA Percentage. This portion of the Target Bonus shall be paid when the yearly audit of the Company has been completed. No bonus will be paid if the EBITA
Percentage is less than 80%. </FONT></P>
