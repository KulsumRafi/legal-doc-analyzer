<PAGE>


				  FORWARD

Effective as of July 1, 1990, the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company has
adopted The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company Equalization Plan (the "Plan")
for the benefit of certain of its employees.  It is intended that the
"excess benefits" provided under the Plan be an unfunded "excess benefit
plan" as that term is defined in Section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, and that the "supplemental benefits" provided
under the Plan be an unfunded deferred compensation plan for "a select group
of management or highly compensated employees" as that term is used in the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

The purpose of the Plan is to provide eligible participants and their
Beneficiaries with the amount of Company-provided benefits that would have
been provided under the Employees Retirement Plan of The Ohio Casualty
Insurance Company ("Retirement Plan") but for the limitations on benefits
imposed under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and the limitation on
compensation for purposes of Retirement Plan imposed by Section 401(a)(17)
of such Code.



				 SECTION ONE


1.1   Except to the extent otherwise indicated herein, and to the extent
      otherwise inappropriate in the context, the definitions contained in
      Section 1 of the Retirement Plan are application under the Plan.

1.2   "Actuarial Equivalent Present Value" means, with respect to Excess
      Benefits and/or Supplemental Benefits, the lump sum actuarial
      present value of the aggregate amount of such Excess Benefits and/or
      Supplemental Benefits payable to or with respect to a participant in
      accordance with the terms of the Plan.  Such lump sum actuarial
      equivalent present value shall be determined on the basis of

      (a)    the same mortality table used for the most current
	     accounting valuation for the Retirement Plan, and

      (b)    the PBGC interest rate then in effect for purposes of
	     valuing immediate annuities for terminating plans in
	     accordance with requirements of Section 4062 of ERISA,
	     adjusted by multiplying such rate by (1 minus the marginal
	     tax rate {reflecting,

	     for this purpose, the combined Ohio and federal marginal tax
	     rates}), and further adjusted by rounding such rate as so
	     determined to the nearest 1/4%.

1.3   "Beneficiary" means the beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be any
      one or more members of his family or other persons, executors,
      administrators, any trust foundation or other entity) designated by
      the participant, at such time and in such manner as the Company
      shall determine, to receive any benefits payable hereunder after the
      death of the participant as provided herein.  If no beneficiary has
      been designated, or if all designated beneficiaries have predeceased
      the participant, the Beneficiary shall be the participant's legal
      representative or, if no legal representative shall have been
      appointed within six (6) months after the death of the participant,
      then to and among such one or more of the spouse and blood relatives
      of such deceased participant as the Company may in its sole
      discretion appoint.

1.4   "Board of Directors" mean the Board of Directors of The Ohio
      Casualty Insurance Company.

1.5   "Company" means The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, or any entity
      which shall be a successor to it in ownership of substantially all
      of its assets and which shall assume all of its rights and
      obligations under the Plan.

1.6   "Excess Benefit" means the excess, if any, of (i) the retirement
      benefit which would have been payable to or with respect to a
      participant at his benefit commencement date under the Retirement
      Plan had the limitations on benefits imposed by Section 14 of the
      Retirement Plan not been applicable over (ii) the retirement benefit
      payable to or with respect to the participant at his benefit
      commencement date under the Retirement Plan.

1.7   "Plan" means The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company Benefit Equalization
      Plan as from time to time in effect.

1.8   "Retirement Plan" means the Employees Retirement Plan of The Ohio
      Casualty Insurance Company.

1.9   "Supplemental Benefit" means the excess, if any, of (i) the
      retirement benefit that would have been payable to or with respect
      to a participant at his benefit commencement date under the
      Retirement Plan had the limitations on benefits imposed by Section
      14 of the Retirement Plan not been applicable and the participant's
      Compensation under the Retirement Plan been inclusive of amounts
      which are disregarded by reason of exceeding the compensation limit
      referred to in subsection 1.7 of the Retirement Plan (as adjusted in
      accordance with Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code), over
      (ii) the sum of (a) the retirement benefit payable to or with respect
      to the participant at his benefit commencement date under the
      Retirement Plan and (b) any Excess Benefit payable under this Plan.

      (b)   No portion of any Excess Benefit or Supplemental Benefit
	    payable hereunder (or, if applicable, the Actuarial
