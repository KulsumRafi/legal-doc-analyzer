<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, if you are injured in an automobile accident, this Plan may reduce (or "set off") its benefits by amounts payable under your automobile insurance policy as&nbsp;well as any amounts payable under the automobile insurance policy of anyone who may be liable for your injuries, and we may seek "restitution" of excess payments.&nbsp; And if this Plan chooses, it may pursue its "subrogation" right by bringing suit directly against anyone who may be liable for your injuries.&nbsp; You are required to assist the Plan in enforcing these equitable rights of subrogation, restitution and set-off.&nbsp; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, but not by way of limitation, if this Plan pays a claim of yours and the Trustees later determine that the claim was for an expense not covered under this Plan, then the Trustees are entitled to recover the&nbsp;payment from you, a member of your family that is also covered under the Plan, and/or the person who provided your treatment, in any combination.&nbsp; Alternatively, the Trustees may set off the amount of the payment from amounts the Plan owes in the future to you, your covered family member, and/or the provider, in any combination.&nbsp; This same rule applies if the Plan pays a claim for a covered expense, but the amount paid exceeds the amount required to be paid under the Plan.&nbsp; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These restitution and set-off provisions apply, among other circumstances, where the Plan pays covered expenses incurred for treatment of&nbsp;an injury or illness for which any other person or plan is or may be liable, and where the Plan's subrogation provision (as described above) does not provide the Plan with a right to recover amounts it paid or pays.&nbsp; If the other person or plan, the other person or plan's insurer, or&nbsp;anyone else on behalf of the other person or plan makes payment to you or on your behalf as compensation for the your injury or illness, and&nbsp;this Plan is not subrogated with respect to the payment, the Plan is entitled to restitution or set-off in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the benefits paid by this Plan for treatment of the injury or illness, or (b)&nbsp;the amount paid to you or on your behalf by the other person or plan.&nbsp; These restitution and set-off provisions are inapplicable where the&nbsp;other person or plan is a medical plan with respect to which this Plan, pursuant to its coordination of benefits provisions, is the primary payer of the covered person's allowable expenses.&nbsp; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, where another person or plan pays compensation to you or&nbsp;on your behalf for an injury or illness for which the other person or plan is or may be liable, and you incur (either before or after payment of&nbsp;such compensation) otherwise covered expenses for treatment of the&nbsp;injury or illness, a special rule applies.&nbsp; In that case, any otherwise covered expenses that are incurred after the date on which the compensation was paid, or that were incurred before that date but not yet paid by the Plan as of that date, shall be excluded from coverage under the Plan (and therefore not paid by the Plan), to the extent that the amount of compensation you or your dependent receives exceeds the amount of&nbsp;covered expenses the Plan has already paid for treatment of the your injury or illness.&nbsp; </P>

Solely at the discretion of the Trustees, however, such expenses may be&nbsp;treated as conditionally covered expenses and be paid; provided, however that the covered person with the cause of action agrees, in consideration of the Plan's payment of such expenses, to reimburse the Plan according to the paragraphs of this Appendix governing subrogation, restitution and set-off.&nbsp; The surviving covered person has all of the&nbsp;obligations and duties described above under the heading "Your Obligations and Duty of Cooperation."  All of the Plan's remedies detailed under that heading may be used by the Plan.&nbsp; In addition, if the&nbsp;covered person with the cause of action fails to honor the obligation&nbsp;to reimburse the Plan, the Plan may sue the covered person or, as applicable, his heirs, guardians, executor, or other representative in order to recover the amounts due the Plan.&nbsp; In that case, the Plan shall also be entitled to reimbursement from the covered person of any and all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.&nbsp; </FONT></TD>
