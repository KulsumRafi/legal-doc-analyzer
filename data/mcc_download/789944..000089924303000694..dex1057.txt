               limitation, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisional
               patents, reexaminations, renewals, extensions, reissues, and
               foreign counterparts) that are equal to or narrower in scope than
               the claims of the Patent are valid and enforceable. Shaklee, for
               itself and its Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns and
               sub-licensees, does also forever relinquish and waive all rights
               to dispute said ownership, validity and enforceability in any
               proceeding of any nature, covenants that it and they will not
               assert, either affirmatively or defensively, in any proceeding of
               any nature, any matter inconsistent with said ownership, validity
               and enforceability, agrees and acknowledges that the foregoing
               shall act as a complete defense and bar to any proceeding of any
               nature challenging such ownership, validity and enforceability or
               any of them, and consents to the entry of temporary and permanent
               injunctions to bar any breach or threatened breach of any of the
               foregoing, without the filing on behalf of Senetek of any bond or
               other security.

          d.   Promotion of the Products. Shaklee agrees that in marketing and
               selling Finished Products it shall not advertise the
               concentration of kinetin in the Product(s) nor will it make any
               comparative claims of product benefit to those kinetin-containing
               products of Senetek or other Senetek licensees, the current list
               of licensees being identified in Exhibit B, hereto attached. In
               addition, with regard to statements of product benefit and/or
               safety that relate to the kinetin ingredient, Shaklee will submit
               to Senetek the text of such statements for Senetek prior
               approval, and such approval by Senetek will not be unreasonably
               withheld or delayed. Shaklee may include in packaging, labeling
               and/or promotional materials for the Finished Products and/or Eye
               Gel that they contain kinetin and may also include the following
               or a similar statement presented in a manner consistent with
               industry practice: "Manufactured and sold under license from
               Senetek". Shaklee may further include the Senetek patent numbers
               relevant to the kinetin technology as described in this
               Agreement.

          e.   Other Rights. It is expressly understood that this Agreement
               grants no rights to Shaklee with respect to any intellectual
               property or confidential information of Senetek except those
               express rights set forth in Section 3.

4.  SUPPLY OF THE KINETIN.

          a.   Senetek covenants that the kinetin compound supplied to Shaklee
               pursuant hereto shall be manufactured in accordance with all
               relevant legal and regulatory requirements, that the manufacturer
               of such compound shall conduct all appropriate quality control
               and related testing to insure that the compound is fit for use in
               human skin care products. Senetek shall provide to Shaklee upon
               request and at no cost to Shaklee, with respect to each
               manufacturing batch of kinetin, proof of ingredients used in the
               manufacture of the kinetin with a certificate of analysis for
               such compound. Upon reasonable notice, Senetek shall permit
               representatives of Shaklee to observe all quality control testing
               and inspect all quality control documentation related to the
               kinetin supplied by Senetek to Shaklee. Senetek further covenants
               that such kinetin compound meets the current Senetek
               specifications [***].

          b.   Skin permeation testing for each new kinetin-based Product will
               be conducted under the supervision and with the established
               methods of Senetek (to ensure that the kinetin active material is
               properly delivered to the skin). Shaklee will pay for the skin
               permeation testing as it applies to the Shaklee formulations
               (i.e., Enfuselle Time Repair AM SPF 15 and Enfuselle C+E Repair
               PM), and Senetek will pay for skin permeation testing as it
               applies to the Eye Gel.

--------------------------------

          c.   Senetek will supply the kinetin compound to Shaklee in accordance
               with Shaklee Purchase Orders, which shall set forth the quantity
               and delivery terms, within ninety days of receipt of Shaklee's
               Purchase Order. Senetek shall ensure that the kinetin is properly
               packed and marked for shipping and routed in accordance with
               Shaklee's Purchase Order. Shipping terms shall be F.O.B.
               Senetek's shipping dock, with freight paid by Shaklee collect. In
               the event of any conflict between the terms of a Shaklee Purchase
               Order and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
               govern, unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing and
               signed by both parties.

          d.   If the kinetin or any portion thereof delivered by Senetek to
               Shaklee is defective in any respect at point of delivery to
               Shaklee's carrier, Shaklee may retain all or any portion of the
               kinetin delivered and return the balance of the defective kinetin
               to Senetek at Senetek's sole expense. Shaklee may require, at its
               option, that Senetek replace any kinetin that Shaklee is entitled
               to reject or grant a refund or credit to Shaklee in lieu thereof.
               Shaklee shall provide notice of rejection of defective kinetin to
               Senetek within 90 days of receipt of the kinetin. Acceptance of
               the kinetin shall be subject to revocation upon later discovery
               of any latent defect in the kinetin at the point of delivery to
               Shaklee's carrier. In the event of a dispute as to whether the
               kinetin is defective, samples of the production lot(s) in dispute
               shall be sent to a testing laboratory mutually agreed to by
               Senetek and Shaklee, whose findings shall be binding on the
               Parties. The cost of such testing shall be borne by the Party
               whose position is not upheld by the testing laboratory. The final
               decision whether to release a production lot of Finished Product
               shall remain with Shaklee. In the case that Senetek provides bulk
               Eye Gel product to Shaklee, Shaklee will prepare the final
               packaging and will decide whether to release a production lot of
               the final Eye Gel finished product. In the case whereby Senetek
               manufactures the Eye Gel complete with final packaging, the
               decision to release production lots of Eye Gel will remain with
               Senetek (based on mutually agreed upon specifications for the Eye
               Gel).

5.  MANUFACTURING OF EYE GEL BY SENETEK.

Senetek will provide manufactured Eye Gel containing kinetin to Shaklee for the
price of [***] per unit based on a lot size of [***] units; these units will be
bulk packed and either shipped to Shaklee for final packaging, or, if requested
by Shaklee, placed into final packaging at Senetek's manufacturer (the cost of
such final packaging will be borne by Shaklee). The manufacturing costs detailed
in this Section 5 are in addition to the Royalty payments indicated in
Section 8.

6.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

Shaklee and Senetek shall comply with all laws, regulations, ordinances, orders,
injunctions, decrees and requirements applicable to the manufacturing,
packaging, storage, shipment and export of all products manufactured pursuant to
the license granted herein, and to its marketing and sale of such products.
Without limiting the foregoing, Shaklee shall manufacture the Finished Products
and Senetek shall manufacture the Eye Gel in full compliance with all applicable
good manufacturing practices requirements for the Territory, shall conduct
appropriate stability testing of such products, shall maintain and implement
appropriate quality control and quality assurance procedures for all raw
materials and components, whether produced internally or supplied by vendors,
and all bulks, work in process and finished goods, shall package, label and
advertise such products marketed and sold by it in accordance with all
applicable legal requirements and in a manner not infringing or violating any
intellectual property or trade rights of third persons, and obtain and maintain
all marketing approvals, registrations or other permits necessary for the lawful
manufacture, packaging, storage, shipment and export, and for its marketing and
sale of such products, in the Authorized Channel within the Territory.

In the event any Product(s) manufactured and/or sold by Shaklee pursuant to this
Agreement must be recalled from distribution by reason of failure to meet any
requirements of law or otherwise, Shaklee shall have the sole responsibility to
conduct the activities necessary for such a recall, with the reasonable
assistance of Senetek to the extent necessary and requested. The costs of such
recall shall be borne by Senetek if arising from the supply of defective Eye Gel
and otherwise by Shaklee.

          b.   Senetek further agrees in consideration of work conducted by
               Shaklee on the formulation of kinetin-based formulations, to

               number of units of Finished Products and Eye Gel sold during such
               calendar quarter and, at the same time, shall pay the royalty set
               forth in subsection (a) above. A handling charge of 1.5% per
               month shall be assessed on any payments more than thirty (30)
               days past due.

9.  RECORDS/INFRINGEMENT/RECOVERY.

               shall provide Senetek reasonable access, with at least (10) days
               prior notice and at times not unreasonably disruptive of
               Shaklee's operations, to conduct audits thereof. No more than one

               deficiency in royalties due of more than ten (10) percent, in
               which event audits may be conducted semi-annually thereafter
               until such audits fail to document such a deficiency. Shaklee
               shall pay a handling charge of one-and-one-half (1-1/2) percent
               per month on the amount of any deficiency in royalties paid
               determined as a result of any such audit. The costs of any such
               audit shall be borne by Senetek unless such audit documents a
               deficiency of more than ten (10) percent, in which case such
               costs shall be reimbursed by Shaklee.

          b.   Notification of Infringement. During the Term, each party shall
               promptly advise the other in writing of any infringement,
               imitation or act by third parties inconsistent with the ownership
               of and rights of Senetek to the Patent or any act of unfair
               competition by third parties with respect to the Finished
               Products or the Eye Gel (any of the foregoing shall be referred
               to as an "infringement") wherever and whenever such infringement
               or act shall come to the attention of such party. If such
               infringement occurs within the Territory, Senetek shall promptly
               take such commercially reasonable action as is required to
               restrain such infringement or otherwise enforce its rights and
               Shaklee shall cooperate fully with the Senetek in such action
               and, if so requested, shall join with Senetek as a party to any
               appropriate legal proceedings for such purpose. Senetek shall
               bear all expenses in connection with the foregoing. In the event
               that within a reasonable time after Senetek becomes aware of such
               infringement within the Territory, Senetek fails to take
               appropriate and diligent action with respect to such
               infringement, Shaklee shall have the right, to the extent
               permitted by law, to institute an action for infringement at its
               own expense, and in its own name, or in the name of any of its
               Affiliates and the right to enforce and collect any judgment
               thereon, subject to the following paragraph.

          c.   Recovery. Any recovery by either party as a result of any claim,
               demand, litigation or other action contemplated by clause b.
               above or any settlement thereof shall first be used to reimburse
               each party for the reasonable costs of the action borne by such
               party (or, if the recovery is less than the aggregate costs of
               such action, shall be distributed between the parties in
               proportion to the costs of the action borne by each of the
               parties), with the remaining amount, if any, to be paid to
               Senetek.

10. INSURANCE/RISK OF LOSS/INDEMNIFICATION.

               selling price value of Finished Products and the Eye Gel in its
               possession or control, in each case with an insurance company
               having a current A.M. Best rating of B+ or better. The insurance
               of each Party shall name the other Party as an additional insured

               practicable, of a major business interruption and/or a natural
               catastrophe that may prevent or delay the delivery of kinetin
               substance or Eye Gel to Shaklee, and Shaklee shall notify Senetek
               in writing within 24 hours, or as soon as practicable, of a major
               business interruption and/or a natural catastrophe that may
               prevent or delay the receipt of kinetin compound or Eye Gel from
               Senetek.

<PAGE>

          c.   Loss. All risk of loss or damage to the kinetin compound from any
               cause whatsoever shall be borne by Senetek until delivery of the
               kinetin compound to, and receipt of the shipment by, Shaklee's
               carrier.

          d.   Indemnification by Senetek. Senetek shall indemnify Shaklee,
               defend and hold Shaklee and Shaklee's officers, directors,
               employees and agents harmless from any and all liability, damage,
               loss, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
               resulting from claims made by any person in connection with the
               use of the kinetin compound, Eye Gel, and/or Finished Products to
               the extent such claims arise out of the negligence, willful
               misconduct of, or breach of any of the terms of this Agreement
               by, of Senetek.

          e.   Indemnification by Shaklee. Shaklee shall indemnify Senetek,
               defend and hold Senetek's and Senetek's officers, directors,
               employees and agents harmless from any and all liability, damage,
               loss, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
               resulting from claims made by any person in connection with the
               use of the kinetin compound, Eye Gel, and/or the Finished
               Products to the extent such claims arise out of the negligence,
               willful misconduct of, or breach of any of the terms of this
               Agreement by, of Shaklee.

          f.   Consequential Damages. Except for claims that include
               consequential damages paid to persons that are not Affiliates of
               an indemnified party, neither Party shall be liable to the other
               for consequential damages, lost profits, injury to reputation, or
               similar claims. Except for claims by third parties, and except as
               provided in Section 7 above relating to Recalls, under no
               circumstances shall Senetek or its Affiliates have any liability
               arising from this Agreement in excess of the highest aggregate
               amount paid to Senetek by Shaklee over the course of any two
               contract year periods.

12. CONFIDENTIALITY.

Senetek and Shaklee have entered into a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement ("MNDA ")

          a.   This Agreement may be terminated immediately by either Party in
               the case of a material

<PAGE>

               breach by the other Party of anyone or more of the terms of this
               Agreement which is not remedied within thirty (30) days after
               receipt by the breaching party of written notice of the breach as
               sent by the terminating Party, or if such breach cannot
               reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, if the
               breaching party has failed to commence such cure within such
               period and diligently prosecute such cure to completion within a
               reasonable time thereafter;

          b.   This Agreement may also be terminated immediately by either Party
               if the other Party files a petition in bankruptcy or a petition
               in bankruptcy is filed against the other Party which is not
               vacated within sixty (60) days or the other Party becomes
               insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or
               any arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law;

          c.   This Agreement may be terminated by Shaklee for any or no reason,
               with or without cause, upon giving at least ninety (90) days
               prior written notice. Notwithstanding Shaklee's termination of
               the Agreement, it shall be responsible for payment and take
               delivery of any kinetin compound under a Shaklee Purchase Order
               in effect as of the date of notice of termination. Shaklee shall
               not be responsible for any other charges or damages in the event
               of termination pursuant to this paragraph.

14. FORCE MAJEURE.

Neither Party shall be liable for delay or failure in the performance of any of
its obligations under this Agreement if and to the extent such delay or failure
is due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of such Party, including
but not limited to fires, floods, explosions, accidents, acts of God, war, riot,
strike, lockout or other concerted acts of workers, acts of government and
shortages of materials; provided, however, that the party claiming that "force
majeure" has affected its performance shall give notice to the other party
within ten (10) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of force majeure,
giving full particulars of the cause or event and the date of first occurrence
thereof, and provided, further, that no force majeure event shall affect
Shaklee's obligation to make timely payment of the cost of kinetin compound
supplied by Senetek or of the royalties due on sales of Finished Products. The
Party claiming force majeure shall use its best efforts to eliminate or prevent
the cause so as to continue performing its obligations under this Agreement.

16. INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES.

If during the Term of and/or as a direct result of this Agreement, either
Shaklee employees or agents or Senetek employees or agents conceive and/or
reduce to practice a discovery or invention, ownership of such discovery or
inventions shall be apportioned as follows:

          a.   If it relates to Senetek's proprietary materials or technology,
               and does not materially relate to Shaklee's proprietary materials
               or technology, it will be owned by Senetek.

          b.   If it relates to Shaklee's proprietary materials or technology,
               and does not materially relate to Senetek's proprietary materials
               or technology, it will be owned by Shaklee.

          c.   If it materially relates to both Senetek's proprietary materials
               or technology and to Shaklee's proprietary materials or
               technology, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith for the
               ownership, rights, use, reduction to practice and
               commercialization of the new technology, the details of which
               will contained in a development agreement between the parties.
               Both parties further agree that prior to a joint agreement
               covering such new technology, neither party will pursue the
               patenting, development or commercialization of such new
               technology without the express written permission of the other
               party.

Each party agrees to assign to the other all rights to all such inventions or
discoveries, consistent with the above-identified ownership rights, in the
Territory. Should Senetek or Shaklee decide to apply for patent protection on
any of such discoveries or inventions relating to materials, composition or
methods of use (as described and allocated immediately above), each party agrees
to assist the other, at the other's reasonable expense, to obtain patent
protection and to assign the patents to the other, including executing any
documents required. In the case of solely-owned inventions or discoveries, the
party that owns such inventions or discoveries shall, at its own expense, have
the right to apply for such patent protection and to prosecute applications for
patents through attorneys and agents of its own choosing.

17. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

          a.   No Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Agreement without
               the prior written consent of the other Party hereto, which
               consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Irrespective of the
               foregoing, either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate
               in the event of a non-bankruptcy related internal reorganization
               of the corporate structure without the consent of the other
               Party.

          b.   Enforceability. The Parties hereto agree that this Agreement
               shall be legally binding upon them and their respective legal
               representatives, successors and assigns.

          c.   Entire Agreement. Except as provided in paragraph 12 of this
               Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire understanding of
               the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
               all prior discussions and agreements between them, including but
               not limited to a Master Supply Agreement of November 6, 2001
               between Technica Consumer Health, a division of Shaklee
               Corporation, and Senetek, which is hereby cancelled. This
               Agreement may be modified only by an instrument in writing signed
               by both Parties.

          d.   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
               interpreted in accordance with the

          *** Confidential portions of this materials have been omitted
        and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission


<PAGE>

               laws of the State of California.

          e.   Waiver. A waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement in
               anyone instance shall not be deemed to continue to be a waiver of
               such term or condition for any similar instance in the future or
               of any subsequent breach hereof.

          f.   Announcements. The parties will issue an agreed upon press
               release upon the execution of this Agreement. Except for such
               release and except as may otherwise be required by law or the
               listing rules of any exchange on which either party's securities
               may be listed or quoted, for which the releasing party shall
               provide prior notice to the other party and the opportunity to
               comment on any required disclosure, neither party will disclose
               the terms of this Agreement to any other person; provided that
               each party may make such disclosure of the terms of this
               Agreement to its employees and agents as is necessary to permit
               such party to perform its obligations under this Agreement;
               provided that any such employee or agent agrees to maintain the
               confidentiality of this Agreement; and provided that at either
               party may make such disclosures of the terms of this Agreement as
               are necessary to enter into license and other agreements that do
               not conflict with the terms of this Agreement. Shaklee
               acknowledges that this Agreement may be deemed to be a "material
               contract" as that term is defined by Item 601(b)(l0) of
               Regulation S-K, and that Senetek may therefore be required to
               file such document as an exhibit to reports or registration
               statements filed under the United States Securities Act or
               Securities Exchange Act, provided that Senetek shall redact
               commercial terms and file for confidential treatment to the
               extent permitted by applicable rules of the United States
               Securities and Exchange Commission.
