SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Withholding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time Motorola is required to withhold any Federal Insurance Contribution Act
("FICA") tax and/or any federal, state or local tax of any kind with respect to the exercise of any Stock Option, the Participant shall pay to Motorola the amount of any such FICA, federal, state or
local tax or taxes required to be withheld. The obligations of Motorola under the Plan shall be conditional on payment of all withholding taxes, and Motorola shall have the right to deduct any such
taxes from any payment of any kind under the Plan or otherwise due to the Participant. Withholding tax obligations may be settled, in whole or in part, with Common Stock. At any time when a
Participant is required to pay to Motorola an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws upon exercise of a Stock Option, the Participant may satisfy this obligation in whole or in part
by transfer to Motorola of Shares previously owned by the Participant, by electing (the "Election") to have Motorola withhold from the distribution Shares of Common Stock having a value equal (as near
as possible) to the amount required to be withheld or by a combination of such means, provided, however, that the amount of federal, state and local income taxes that may be paid by transfer or
withholding of Shares shall not exceed the statutory minimum withholding requirements. The amount of any withholding tax not paid by transfer or withholding of Shares shall be paid to Motorola in
cash. The value of the Shares transferred or to be withheld shall be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld
shall be determined ("Tax Date") or if Shares did not trade on the New York Stock Exchange on the Tax Date, as of the last previous date Shares did so trade. Each Election must be made on or prior to
the Tax Date. The Committee may disapprove of any Election or may suspend, condition, restrict or terminate the right to make Elections. An Election is irrevocable, unless revocation is approved by
the Committee. </FONT></P>

(a)&nbsp;Motorola may, if it shall determine it necessary or desirable for any reason, at the time of award of any Stock Option or the issuance of any Shares of Common Stock, require the recipient
of the Stock Option, as a condition to the receipt thereof or to the receipt of Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant thereto, to deliver to Motorola a written representation of present intention to
acquire the Stock Option or the Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant thereto for his or her own account for investment and not for distribution; and (b)&nbsp;if at any time Motorola further
determines that the listing, registration or qualification (or any updating of any such document) of any Stock Option or the Shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto is necessary on any

Motorola may terminate any Stock Option or terminate, condition, restrict or limit the issuance or delivery of any Shares of Common Stock if it determines that such Stock Option or delivery violates

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification and Exculpation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each person, who is or shall have been a member of the Board or of the
Committee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by Motorola against and from any and all loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such person may be a party or in which such person may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan
and against and from any and all amounts paid by such person in settlement thereof (with Motorola's written approval) or paid by such person in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or
proceeding, except a judgment based upon a finding of such person's bad faith, subject,however, to the condition that upon the institution of any claim, action, suit or proceeding against such person,
such person shall in writing give Motorola an opportunity, at its own expense, to participate in, and to the extent it may wish, to assume the defense thereof before such person undertakes to handle
it on such person's own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right to which such person may be entitled as a matter of law, under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Motorola or otherwise, or any power that Motorola may have to indemnify such person or hold such person harmless.
Each member of the Board or of the Committee, and each officer and employee of Motorola shall be fully justified in relying or acting upon any information furnished on behalf of Motorola by any person
or persons other than himself or herself in connection with the administration of the Plan. In no event shall any person who is or shall have been a member of the Board or of the Committee, or an
officer or employee of Motorola, be liable for any determination made or other action taken or any omission to act in reliance upon any such information, or for any action taken (including the
furnishing of information) or any failure to act, if in good faith. </FONT></P>
