<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, excelerate technologies Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), promises to pay, subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, to the order of AUGUST TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION with an address at 4900 West 78<SUP>th</SUP> Street, Bloomington, Minnesota 55435 (hereinafter referred to as the "Holder"), the
principal sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (hereinafter called the "Principal"), plus interest thereon at the rate set forth below, on the Maturity Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following is a statement of the rights of the Holder and the conditions to which this Note is subject, to which the Holder hereof, by the acceptance of this Note, agrees: </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Note, the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the
following meanings: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;"Delayed
Conversion" shall mean the automatic conversion of this Note as of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.2, if a conversion pursuant to
Section&nbsp;3.1 has not occurred prior to that date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;"Delayed
Conversion Price" shall mean $4&nbsp;million dollars divided by the number of shares of the Company outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean all
outstanding shares of the Company, all outstanding employee incentive shares of excelerate technologies Incentive Plan, LLC, and all then outstanding rights or securities, if any, exercisable for or
convertible into shares of the Company, but excluding this Note), immediately prior to a Delayed Conversion. By way of example, assume that immediately prior to the Delayed Conversion, there are the
same 11,913,750 shares and options of the Company outstanding on a fully diluted basis as are outstanding on the date of this Note. The Delayed Conversion Price would then be equal to $0.33575 per
share. Assuming that the total principal and interest outstanding under this Note as of such date were $520,000, then this Note would convert into 1,548,771 Series&nbsp;A Preferred Shares. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maturity
Date" shall mean the November&nbsp;2, 2002, which is the date which is six months after the date of this Note. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;"Note"
shall mean this Convertible Promissory Note in the original principal amount of $500,000.00. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noteholder,"
"Holder," or similar terms, when the context refers to a holder of this Note, shall mean any person who shall at the time be the holder of this Note. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;"Price
Per Share" shall mean the price per share at which preferred shares of the Company are sold in a Qualifying Preferred Share Financing. In the event that not all
shares are sold at the same price in such financing, then the Price Per Share shall be the weighted average price of the first shares sold with proceeds aggregating $3&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

"Series&nbsp;A Conversion Price"). The Series&nbsp;A Conversion Price shall be subjected to certain anti-dilution adjustments. </FONT></P>

warrants issued pursuant to a joint venture, technology licensing, distribution or other similar transaction that is primarily for a purpose other than raising capital, and (iii)&nbsp;shares issued
in connection with an acquisition of another business or company, provided, however, that the total number of shares issued that are subject to the foregoing exceptions in clauses (i), (ii)&nbsp;and
