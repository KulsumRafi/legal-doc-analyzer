                        AMENDMENT TO TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

                                      with
                              CONCORD CAMERA CORP.



         AMENDMENT, dated as of November 20, 2002, to Terms of Employment dated
as of January 1, 2000 (the "Agreement") by and between CONCORD CAMERA CORP. (the
"Company") and URS W. STAMPFLI (the "executive").

         FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

         1. Section 1 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its
entirety with the following:

         "1)      Position

                  Since February 25, 2002, Senior Vice President and Director of
                  Global Sales and Marketing."

         2. Section 3 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its
entirety with the following:

         "3)      Term

                  The term hereof shall commence effective as of January 1, 2000
                  (the "Effective Date") and shall end on February 28, 2003,
                  inclusive (the "Term"). Thereafter, the Term may be renewed or
                  extended by mutual agreement of both parties in writing. The
                  employment may be terminated by the Company in accordance with
                  Section 12 below at any time during the Term."

         3. The first paragraph of Section 5 of the Agreement is hereby deleted
and replaced in its entirety with the following:

                  "Salary: $210,000 per annum, increasing to $236,800 effective
                  as of January 1, 2001, reducing to $210,000 effective as of
                  July 1, 2001, and increasing to $235,000 as of February 25,
                  2002. The aforesaid salary amount is payable in accordance
                  with the Company's normal payroll policies for executives and
                  is to be reviewed on an annual basis."

         4. The second paragraph of Section 12 of the Agreement is hereby
deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

         o        "Concord may terminate the employee's employment at any time
                  for any reason or without reason by giving the employee 30
                  days' written notice. The employee may terminate his
                  employment after January 1, 2003 for any reason or without
                  reason by giving Concord 30 days' written notice. In the event
                  Concord elects to terminate pursuant to this provision, it may
                  at its option request employee to remain in its employment
                  during the 30 day period following delivery of notice of
                  termination, provided that the Company shall continue to
                  provide the employee with his normal and customary
                  compensation and benefits as prescribed in Sections 5, 8 and
                  11. Alternatively, Concord may require the employee to cease
                  working at any time during the 30-day notice period. If: (i)
                  Concord terminates the employee's employment without cause (as
                  defined above in this Section) whether during the Term or at
                  any time after the expiration of the Term; or (ii) the
                  employee terminates his employment with Concord after January
                  1, 2003 (but not before), then the employee will be paid for a
                  total of one (1) year (post-employment compensation),
                  excluding any portion of the 30-day notice period for which
                  the employee remained in the Company's employment, at the then
                  effective compensation provided for in Section 5. The portions
                  of such post-employment compensation that are related to the
                  employee's salary and auto allowance will be paid in
                  installments (net of required withholding) in accordance with
                  the Company's normal payroll schedule for executives. The
                  Company's obligation to pay any such post-employment
                  compensation is conditioned upon the employee's prior and
                  continued compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
                  including, but not limited to, Section 13 and Exhibit A."

         5. The last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 13 of the
Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

                  "The employee acknowledges that, if the Company terminates the
                  employee's employment with cause (as defined in Section 12) or
                  if the employee terminates his employment with the Company
                  before January 2, 2003 (in breach of this Agreement), then the
                  employee will not be entitled to receive the post-employment
                  compensation described in Section 12 but the non-compete
                  covenants will nevertheless remain in full force and effect."

         6. Unless otherwise provided herein, all capitalized terms shall have
the meaning assigned to such terms in the Agreement.

         7. Except as hereby amended, the Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Amendment as of
the date first above written.

EXECUTIVE:                                 CONCORD CAMERA CORP.
