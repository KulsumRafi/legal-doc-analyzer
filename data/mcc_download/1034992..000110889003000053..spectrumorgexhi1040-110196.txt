November 17, 2002

Santa Rosa, California


For value received, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Spectrum Organic
Products, Inc., a California corporation, ("the Company") hereby promises to pay
to Debora Bainbridge Phillips, Trustee, or order, at such place as designated by
the holder hereunder, the principal sum of $609,375.00, together with interest
thereon as hereinafter provided and in installments as hereinafter provided.

This Amended and Restated Promissory Note has been issued pursuant to the
Redemption Agreement dated November 1, 1996, as amended through the date hereof,
and represents the unpaid principal due under the Promissory Note called for
under such Agreement. The outstanding principal balance hereunder shall bear
interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Interest on the principal balance
outstanding from time to time shall be paid in monthly installments of interest
only on or before the 5th day of each month. In addition to said interest
payments, principal payments shall be paid in monthly installments of $15,625.00
on or before the 20th day of each month commencing November 20, 2002 until all
such principal has been paid in full.

The holder hereunder, at its sole option, shall have the right at all times,
upon 60 days prior written notice to the Company, to monthly principal payments
of $31,250 until all such principal has been paid in full.

In the event that any payment of principal or interest shall not be made within
five (5) days of its due date, there shall also be due a late payment fee equal
to one percent of the payment of principal or interest not made when due. This
Promissory Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty.

Presentment and demand for payment, notice of dishonor, protest and notice of
protest are hereby waived by the Company.

All payments shall be made in lawful money of the United States. Any payment
received shall be applied first to interest outstanding and then to reduction of
principal. In the event that (i) any payment of principal or interest shall not
be made when due and a period of ten (10) days shall have passed from written
notice of such non-payment without cure, or (ii) the Company or the Guarantor
shall fail to comply with any material non-monetary terms and conditions of the
Redemption Agreement or the Guaranty and a period of 30 days shall have passed
from written notice of such failure without cure, then the holder of this Note
may, without further notice, declare the entire unpaid principal and interest
due and payable.
