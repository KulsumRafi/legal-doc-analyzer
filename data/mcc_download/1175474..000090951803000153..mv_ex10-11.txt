                      aggregate Available Balance of all Collection Accounts
                      shall be transferred by the respective banks maintaining

                      effect, to endorse and sign its name or the name of any
                      other Obligor on all checks, drafts, money orders or other
                      media of payment so delivered, and such endorsements or
                      assignments shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have

                      endorsement or assignment thereof by the Administrative
                      Agent. The Administrative Agent may use any convenient or
                      customary means for the purpose of collecting such checks,
                      drafts, money orders or other media of payment. If,

                      to the Administrative Agent in accordance with clause (B)
                      above are deposited into any Concentration Account or
                      Disbursement Account, the applicable Obligor(s) shall hold
                      all such funds in trust for the Administrative Agent on
                      behalf of the Secured Parties, shall not commingle such
                      funds with any other funds or property of any Obligor and

                      Agent in the manner described in the applicable Notice of
                      Cash Dominion.

                                   ARTICLE IV

Lenders to consent to the amendments contained herein and to enter into this
Amendment, each Obligor, jointly and severally, represents and warrants as set
forth below:

                      (a) After giving effect to this Amendment, the amendment
           of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement do not impair the
           validity, effectiveness or priority of the Liens granted pursuant to
           any Loan Documents relating thereto (the "Security Documents"), and
           such Liens continue unimpaired with the same priority to secure
           repayment of all Obligations, whether heretofore or hereafter
           incurred. The amendment of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement
           effected pursuant to this Amendment do not require that any new
           filings be made or other action taken to perfect or to maintain the
           perfection of such Liens. The position of the Lenders with respect to
           such Liens, the Collateral (as defined in the Security Documents) in
           which a security interest was granted pursuant to the Security
           Documents, and the ability of the Administrative Agent to realize
           upon such Liens pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents have
           not been adversely affected in any material respect by the amendment
           of certain provisions of the Credit Agreement effected pursuant to
           this Amendment or by the execution, delivery, performance or
           effectiveness of this Amendment.

                      (b) Each Obligor reaffirms as of the Amendment Effective
           Date such Person's respective covenants and agreements contained in
           the Credit Agreement, each Security Document to which such Person is
           a party, including, in each case, as such covenants and agreements
           may be modified by this Amendment. Each such Obligor further confirms
           that each such Loan Document to which such Person is a party is and
           shall continue to be in full force and effect and the same are hereby
           ratified, approved and confirmed in all respects, except that upon
           the occurrence of the Amendment Effective Date, all references in
           such Loan Documents to the "Credit Agreement", "Loan Documents",
           "thereunder", "thereof", "therein" or words of like or similar import
           shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement and the Loan
           Documents as amended hereby.

                      (c) Both immediately before and immediately after giving
           effect to this Amendment, the representations and warranties set
           forth in Article VI of the Credit Agreement and each other Loan
           Document are, in each case, true and correct (unless stated to relate
           solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and
           warranties shall be true and correct as of such earlier date).

           SECTION 4.02 VALIDITY, ETC. This Amendment constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Obligors enforceable in accordance with its
terms subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.

           SECTION 4.03 NO DEFAULT. Both immediately before and immediately
after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default has occurred and is
continuing.

Agreement or any other Loan Document or of any other term or condition of the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor shall the entering into of this
Amendment preclude any Agent and/or any Lender from refusing to enter into any
further waivers or amendments with respect thereto.

           SECTION 5.02 HEADINGS. The various headings of this Amendment are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation
