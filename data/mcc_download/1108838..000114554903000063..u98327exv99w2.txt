                                    [English Translation of Local Press Release]
                                                                January 16, 2003


     HANARO TELECOM, INC. ('THE COMPANY' OR 'HANARO') ANNOUNCES ITS DECISION
           TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN
                      KOREA THRUNET CO., LTD. ('THRUNET')

On January 15, 2003, Hanaro notified TriGem Computer, the major shareholder of
Thrunet, and its affiliates, the Company's decision to terminate the Share
Purchase Agreement with them after a careful due diligence on and a review of
the Disclosure Schedule submitted by Thrunet. Such decision was based on section
8.2(f) of the Share Purchase Agreement, which stipulates that the Company may
terminate the Agreement within ten days after obtaining the Disclosure Schedule
if such Disclosure Schedule is not satisfactory.

Hanaro, after signing of the Agreement on December 30, 2002, conducted a due
diligence on Thrunet with a group of approximately 30 personnel including
accountants and lawyers, and received the Disclosure Schedule from Thrunet on
January 7, 2003.

For the background of the termination of the Agreement, Mr. Young Wan Cho, Vice
President, Finance, commented that "Hanaro has been pursuing acquisition of a
controlling stake in Thrunet to strengthen the Company's competitiveness in the
broadband market. However, through a careful due diligence on Thrunet, we learnt
that short-term financial burden is expected to outweigh the material
synergistic effects expected from the investment." "Hanaro plans to focus on
achieving net profit positive this year and securing necessary funds for new
projects and debt repayments", he added.
