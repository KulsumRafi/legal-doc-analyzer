<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">WHEREAS, the
Company believes it is essential to retain and attract qualified directors and
officers;</p>

and other claims being asserted against directors and officers of public
companies; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">WHEREAS, in
recognition of the Indemnitee's need for (i)&nbsp;substantial protection against
personal liability<b> </b>based on the Indemnitee's reliance on the Bylaws,
(ii)&nbsp;specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by the Bylaws
will be available to the Indemnitee, regardless of, among other things, any
amendment to or revocation of the Bylaws or any change in the composition of the
Company's Board of Directors (the "<u>Board</u>") or acquisition transaction
relating to the Company, and (iii)&nbsp;an inducement to continue to provide
effective services to the Company as a director and/or officer thereof, the
Company wishes to provide for the indemnification of the Indemnitee and to
advance expenses to the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and as

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Indemnification.&nbsp; </b>In the event the Indemnitee was or is a
party to or is involved (as a party, witness, or otherwise) in any Proceeding by
reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, whether the basis
of the Proceeding is the Indemnitee's alleged action in an official capacity as
a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or
officer, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL against any and all Expenses, liability, and loss
(including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other charges
imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed on any
director or officer as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments
under this Agreement) (collectively, "<u>Liabilities</u>") reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person in connection with such Proceeding.&nbsp; The Company
shall provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 2 as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 30 days after it receives written demand from the
Indemnitee.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and
except as provided in Section&nbsp;5 below, the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (i) in connection with any Proceeding
initiated by the Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of
the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the initiation of
such Proceeding or (ii) on account of any suit in which judgment is rendered
against the Indemnitee pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act for an
accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of
securities of the Company.</p>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Advancement of Expenses.&nbsp; </b>The Company shall advance
Expenses to the Indemnitee within 30 business days of such request (an "<u>Expense
Advance</u>"); provided, however, that if required by applicable corporate laws
such Expenses shall be advanced only upon delivery to the Company of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company; and provided further, that the Company shall make such advances
only to the extent permitted by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee while
not acting in his/her capacity as a director or officer, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, may be advanced upon such terms and
conditions as the Board, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.</p>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Review Procedure for Indemnification.&nbsp; </b>Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i)&nbsp;the obligations of the Company under Sections&nbsp;2 and 3 above shall
be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not have determined
(in a written opinion, in any case in which the special independent counsel
referred to in Section&nbsp;6 hereof is involved) that the Indemnitee would not be
permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii)&nbsp;the obligation of the
Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 above shall be subject
to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party
determines that the Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under
applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnitee
(who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore
paid; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings
in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5 below to secure a
determination that the Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law,
any determination made by the Reviewing Party that the Indemnitee would not be
permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and the
Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense
Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to
which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed).&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Indemnitee's obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances pursuant
to this Section 4 shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.&nbsp;
If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be selected
by the Board, and if there has been such a Change in Control, other than a
Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board
who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control, the Reviewing
Party shall be the special independent counsel referred to in Section&nbsp;6 hereof.</p>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Enforcement of Indemnification Rights.</b>&nbsp; If the Reviewing
Party determines that the Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be
indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, or if the Indemnitee has
not otherwise been paid in full pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 above within 30
days after a written demand has been received by the Company, the Indemnitee
shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the State of
Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper
to recover the unpaid amount of the demand (an "<u>Enforcement Proceeding</u>")
and, if successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be
paid any and all Expenses in connection with such Enforcement Proceeding.&nbsp; The
Company hereby consents to service of process for such Enforcement Proceeding
and to appear in any such Enforcement Proceeding.&nbsp; Any determination by the
Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the
Indemnitee.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Change in Control</b>.&nbsp; The Company agrees that if there is a
Change in Control of the Company, other than a Change in Control which has been
approved by a majority of the Company's Board who were directors immediately
prior to such Change in Control, then with respect to all matters thereafter
arising concerning the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnity payments and
Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable
law or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws now or hereafter in
effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall
seek legal advice only from special independent counsel selected by the
Indemnitee and approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.&nbsp; Such special independent counsel shall not have otherwise performed
services for the Company or the Indemnitee, other than in connection with such
matters, within the last five years.&nbsp; Such independent counsel shall not include
any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company
or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights under this
Agreement.&nbsp; Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion
to the Company and the Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the
Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.&nbsp; The
Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the special independent counsel
referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all
expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of special independent
counsel pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Establishment of Trust</b>.&nbsp; In the event of a Potential Change
in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by the Indemnitee, create a
trust (the "<u>Trust</u>") for the benefit of the Indemnitee, and from time to
time upon written request of the Indemnitee shall fund such Trust, to the extent
permitted by law, in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses
reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in
connection with investigating, preparing for and defending any Proceeding
relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties
and settlement amounts of any and all Proceedings relating to an Indemnifiable
Event from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or
proposed to be paid.&nbsp; The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust
pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the
Reviewing Party, in any case in which the special independent counsel referred
to in Section 6 is involved.&nbsp; The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a
Change in Control (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof
invaded, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, (ii) the trustee of the
Trust (the "<u>Trustee</u>") shall advance, within ten business days of a
request by the Indemnitee, any and all Expenses to the Indemnitee, to the extent
permitted by law, (and the Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the Trust under
the circumstances under which the Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the
Company under Section 4 of this Agreement), (iii) the Trust shall continue to be
funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above,
(iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee all amounts for which the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise, and (v) all unexpended funds in the Trust shall revert to the Company
upon a final determination by the Reviewing Party or a court of competent
jurisdiction, as the case may be, that the Indemnitee has been fully indemnified
under the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Trustee shall be a bank or trust company
or other individual or entity chosen by the Indemnitee and acceptable to and
approved of by the Company.&nbsp; Nothing in this Section 7 shall relieve the Company
of any of its obligations under this Agreement.&nbsp; All income earned on the assets
held in the Trust shall be reported as income by the Company for federal, state,
local and foreign tax purposes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Partial Indemnity</b>. &nbsp;If the Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a
portion of the Expenses and&nbsp; Liabilities, but not, however, for all of the total
amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the
portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is entitled.&nbsp; Moreover, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Proceedings
relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any
issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, the Indemnitee
shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.&nbsp; In
connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to
whether the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of
proof shall be on the Company to establish that the Indemnitee is not so
entitled. </p>

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Non-exclusivity</b>.&nbsp; The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder
shall be in addition to any other rights the Indemnitee may have under any
statute, provision of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.&nbsp; To the extent that a change in the DGCL permits greater indemnification
by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties
hereto that the Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so
afforded by such change.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Liability Insurance</b>.&nbsp; To the extent the Company maintains an insurance
policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, the

or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director
or officer of the Company.</p>

<b>Settlement of Claims</b>.&nbsp; The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the
Indemnitee under this Agreement (a) for any amounts paid in settlement of any
action or claim effected without the Company's written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) for any judicial award if the Company
was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to
participate in the defense of such action.</p>

<b>No Presumption</b>.&nbsp; For purposes of this Agreement, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the termination of any Proceeding, action, suit or claim, by
judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not
create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of
conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 12.0pt">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

action shall be asserted by or on behalf of the Company or any affiliate of the
Company against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or
personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the
date of accrual of such cause of action, or such longer period as may be
required by state law under the circumstances, and any claim or cause of action
of the Company or its affiliate shall be extinguished and deemed released unless
asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such period; provided,
