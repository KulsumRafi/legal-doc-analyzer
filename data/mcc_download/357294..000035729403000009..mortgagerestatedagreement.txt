continued as a Eurodollar Advance. During the continuance of a
Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the
Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required
Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 9.1 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to reductions in interest rates)
declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the
remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each
Advance (other than those under clause (i) above) and each Swingline
Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate plus 2% per annum; provided that, during the continuance of a
Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances and
Swingline Loans without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender.
2.12 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall
be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant
to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the
Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrowers, on the date
when due by (i) noon (Dallas time) with respect to all Advances other
than Swingline Loans and (ii) 4:00 p.m. (Dallas time) with respect to
Swingline Loans and all such payments shall be applied in accordance
with Section 2.9.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrowers
fail to give the Agent notice of repayment of a Fed Funds Advance
before 10:00 a.m. (Dallas time) on the Business Day that the
Borrowers intend to repay such Fed Funds Advance, any payment of such
Fed Funds Advance received by the Agent on such Business Day shall be
deemed to have been received by the Agent at the opening of business on
the following Business Day. Each payment delivered to the Agent
for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent
to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its
address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending
Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such
Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the
Borrowers maintained with Guaranty Bank for each payment of principal,
interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.
2.13 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.
(i) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to
time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(ii) Subject to Section 2.3, the Agent shall also maintain accounts in
which it will record (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the
Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and
(c) the amo unt of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the
Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof.
(iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with
their terms.
(iv) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a Note. In
such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be
represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee
named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the
extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such
Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once
again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.
2.14 Telephonic Notices. The Borrowers hereby authorize the Lenders and
the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of
Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices
made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith
believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrowers, it being understood
that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow
Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given
telephonically. The Borrowers agree to deliver promptly to the Agent a
written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or
any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer.
If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the
action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and
the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
2.15 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Subject to Section
2.3, interest shall be payable in accordance with the following
provisions. Interest accrued on each Advance other than a Eurodollar
Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the
first such date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the
last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which
the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar
Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three- month interval
during such Interest Period  Interest and Fees shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.
Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for
the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received at the
place of payment prior to the time required for payment as set forth in
Section 2.14. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in
computing interest in connection with such payment.
2.16 Notification by the Agent. Promptly after receipt thereof, the
Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate
Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation
Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. Promptly upon
determination thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender making a
portion of any Eurodollar Advance and the Borrowers of the interest
rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance. When any Fed Funds Advances
or Alternate Base Rate Advances are outstanding or have been
requested, the Agent will give each Lender making or holding any such
Loans and the Borrowers prompt notice of each change in such rates.
2.17 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time.
All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending
Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of such Lending
Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the
Borrowers in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or
additional Lending Installation through which Loans
will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
2.18 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrowers or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on
which it is scheduled to make payment to the
Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or an
Advance or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, a payment of principal
(including but not limited to situations in which the
Borrowers inform the Agent that the Agent will be receiving proceeds of
Collateral on a specific date and that the Borrowers intend to use such
proceeds to make a payment of principal), interest or Fees to the Agent
for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such
payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The
Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or the Borrowers, as the case may be, has
not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such
payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so
made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day
during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made
available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at
a rate per annum. equal to (x) in the case of payment due from a
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first

thereof by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:
(i) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any
Taxes or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with
respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar
Loans, or (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other
than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Ad vances), or
(iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or reduces any
amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or
any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by
reference to the amount of its Eurodollar Loans held or interest
received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Lender or applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its
Eurodollar Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such
Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such
Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then, within 15 days of demand by such
Lender, the Borrowers shall pay such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction in an amount received.
3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender,
any Lend ing Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days

amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return
on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines
is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make
Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to
capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this
Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of
or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or

on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including
transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior
to the date of this Agreement.
3.3 Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders
determine that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match
fund Eurodollar Advances or Fed Funds Advances are not available or
(ii) the interest rate applicable to a Type of Advance does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Advance, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance and require any Advances of the affected Type to be repaid or
converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances, subject to the payment
of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.

or maintain the Eurodollar Advance.

(i) All payments by the Borrowers to or for the account of any Lender
or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrowers shall
be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum
payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums

no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrowers shall make such
deductions, (c) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the
Borrowers shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").
((iii) The Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify the Agent and each
Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under
this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be
made within 30 days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.
(iv) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees
that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Borrowers and the Agent two duly
completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-BEN
or W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of
the Borrowers and the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8
or W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an
exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S.
Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrowers and the
Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor
form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete,
and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional
forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrowers or the Agent. All forms or amendments described in the
preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
(including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation)
has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or
which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any
such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the
Borrowers and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax.
(v) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide
the Borrowers with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation,
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date
on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S.
Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5
with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that,
should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the
Borrowers shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall
reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such
Taxes. (vi) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction
or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
reduced rate.
(vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
authority of the United States or any other country or any political
subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly
completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change
in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding
ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the
Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable to the Agent under this subsection, together with all
costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees
and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be
employees of the Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this
Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement. 3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of
Indemnity. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall
designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its
Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability
of a Type of Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is
not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.
Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the
Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any,
under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set
forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender
determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. Determination
of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar
Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar
Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity
corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate or the Purchase Price applicable to such Loan, whether
in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the
amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be
payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written
statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement.

Collateral Agent. The Borrowers assume the responsibility for loss or
destruction of any such Required Mortgage Documents until
the same are delivered to the Collateral Agent.

least equal to the Coverage Requirement or any payment under Section
2.9 which may be required as a result of such release has been made and
(iii) the release of such Collateral will not create a violation of any
Lending Sublimit or Borrowing Base Sublimit.

the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a "cash collateral" account
of Hovnanian Mortgage, Account #3801990619, and a "cash collateral"
account of Hovnanian American, Account #        (collectively,

transfers from the Funding Account only be released upon the secondary
authorization of the Agent, (iii) requiring the closing agents for such
AP Mortgages to enter into escrow or other agreements regarding the
monies used to fund such AP Mortgages, and (iv) requiring the Borrowers
to provide the Agent and the Lenders with such information regarding
the funding of such AP Mortgages as the Agent may reasonably request.
The Borrowers, at their expense, shall from time to time execute and
deliver to the Agent or the Collateral Agent all such assignments,
certificates, supplemental documents, and financing statements, and
shall do all other acts or things, as the Agent may reasonably request
in order to more fully implement such procedures.

in the enforcement hereof), together with interest thereon at the rate
per annum of 2% plus the Alternate Base Rate from the time of payment
until repaid, shall become a part of the Obligations.
(vii) Following the occurrence of a Default and the acceleration of the
Obligations the Agent shall be entitled to receive and collect all sums
payable to the Borrowers in respect of the Collateral and (a) the
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, may in its own name or
in the name of a Borrower or otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or
receive any money or property at any time payable or receivable on
account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral, (b) the Borrowers
shall receive and hold in trust for the Lenders any amounts thereafter

so received and collected by the Agent either directly or from the

any moneys in the Settlement Accounts and the Funding Accounts
shall be applied by the Agent: FIRST, to the payment of all costs and
expenses of such sale or enforcement, including reasonable compensation
to the Agent's agents and counsel, and all expenses,
liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Agent or any Lender
acting on instructions of the Required Lenders in connection therewith;
SECOND, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the

of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this
Agreement. If the proceeds of any such sale are insufficient to cover
the costs and expenses of such sale, as aforesaid, and the payment in
full of the Obligations, the Borrowers shall remain liable for any
deficiency.
8.9 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a
Default or the inability of the Borrowers to satisfy the conditions
precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.
Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in
writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 9.1, and

term "secured party" as defined in the Texas Uniform Commercial Code as

on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach
of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

taken by the Agent.
10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrowers, the
Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith, whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise
except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.
10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify
(i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with

observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under
any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an
obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (iii) the

genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing
furnished in connection therewith; (vi) the value, sufficiency,
creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral
security; or (vii) the financial condition of the Borrowers or any
guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrowers' or any
such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty
to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be
furnished by the Borrowers to the Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrowers to the Agent (either in its
capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).
10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions
signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on
all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall
be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken
by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the
Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document
unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or
through employees, agents, and attorneys-in- fact and shall not be

of any such agents or attorneys-in- fact selected by it with reasonable
care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning the
contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders and all
matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.
10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent sha ll be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or

selected by the Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Agent.
10.8 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their
respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in
proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination)
(i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Agent
is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents,
(ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the
Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,

connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any
other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions
contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with
any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of
the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan
Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any
of the foregoing is found in, a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any
indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall,
notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the
relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
10.9 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or
the Borrowers referring to this Agreement describing such
Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice
of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a notice, the
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.
10.10 Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other
Loan Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and
the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a
Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in
its individual capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries in which the Borrowers or
such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other
Person. The Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to be
or remain a Lender.
10.11 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any
other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the
Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
10.12 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such
resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent
or, if no successor Agent has been appointed, forty-five days after the
retiring Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
within thirty days after the resigning Agent 's giving notice of its
intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of
the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. Notwithstanding
the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of
the Borrowers or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a
commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder.  If the Agent has
resigned and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may
perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrowers shall
make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable
Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder
until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such
successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained
earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the
effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the resigning Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of an
Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the
Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations to
an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "`Prime
Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or
other analogous rate of the new Agent.
10.13 Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrowers and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to
any of its Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's
directors, officers, agents and employees) which performs duties in
connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits
of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which
the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.
10.14 Collateral Releases. The Lenders hereby empower and authorize the
Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrowers on their behalf any
agreements, documents or instruments as shall be necessary or
appropriate to effect any releases of Collateral which shall be
permitted by the terms hereof or of any other Loan Document or which
shall otherwise have been approved by the Required Lenders (or, if
required by the terms of Section 9.1, all of the Lenders) in
writing.
ARTICLE XI
SETOFF; RATABLE PAYM ENTS
11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law,
11.2 If a Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default
occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether
provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any
other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of such
Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the
Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or
any part hereof, shall then be due.
11.3 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than
that received by any other Le nder, such Lender agrees, promptly
upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other
Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable
proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff
or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders
share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their
Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or
otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be
made.
11.4 Custodial Accounts. The Borrowers agree that funds received and
held by the Borrowers as custodian for FNMA, GNMA or other mortgage
pools which are deposited into accounts with any Lender shall be
clearly identified as custodial accounts, and each Lender
agrees that each provis ion of the foregoing subsections of this
Article XI shall not apply to such custodial accounts. The Borrowers
shall not deposit any of its general funds in any custodial
accounts or otherwise commingle funds in any custodial accounts.
ARTICLE XII
ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS; COMMITMENT INCREASES
12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrowers and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns,
except that (i) the Borrowers shall not have the right to assign its
rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) and assignment
by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. The parties
to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1
relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments
creating security interests, including, without limitation, any pledge
or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided,
however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest
shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder
unless and until the parties hereto have complied with the provisions
of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3,
provided, however, that the Agent may in its discretion (but
shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which
made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to
such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any
Loans or any Note agrees by acceptance of such transfer or
assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the
time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the
owner of the Rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, or assignee of the rights to such Loan.
12.2 Participations.
12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held
by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of
such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by
a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the
owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence
thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable
by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and
the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
the Loan Documents.
12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other
than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives
principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees
payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, extends the
Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled
payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or
Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases all or
substantially all of the Collateral (other than as expressly permitted
pursuant to the Loan Documents).
12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff. The Borrowers agree that each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating
interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan
Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff
provided in Section  11.1 with respect to the amount of participating
interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with
each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right
of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender,
any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff,
such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each
Participant were a Lender.
12.3 Assignments.
12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of
its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part
of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit "J' hereto or in
such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent
of the Borrowers and the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment
becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or
an Affiliate thereof, provided, however, that if a Default has occurred
and is continuing, the consent of the Borrowers shall not be
required. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Each such assignment shall (unless it is to a Lender or an Affiliate
thereof or each of the Borrowers and the Agent otherwise consents) be
in an amount not less than the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 or (ii) the
remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment (calculated as at
the date of such assignment).
12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of a
notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Annex "I"
to Exhibit "J' hereto (a "Notice of Assignment "), together with any
consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee
to the Agent for processing such assignment, such assignment
shall become effective on the effective date specified in such Notice
of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation
by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to
make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable
assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that
the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan
Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the
effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all
purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan
Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the
rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the
same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further
consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent shall be
required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the
percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such
Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and
the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires
that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements
so that new Notes or, as appropriate replacement Notes are issued to
such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement
Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts
reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such
assignment. In addition, within a reasonable time after the
effective date of any assignment, the Agent shall, and is hereby
authorized and directed to, revise Schedule "2' reflecting the revised
commitments and percentages of each of the Lenders and shall distribute
such revised Schedule "2' to each of the Lenders and the
Borrowers, whereupon such revised Schedule shall replace the old
Schedule and become part of this Agreement.
12.4 Commitment Increases.
12.4.1 Increases to Aggregate Commitment. The Borrowers shall have the
right to increase the Aggregate Commitment by obtaining additional
Commitments, either from one or more of the Lenders or another lending
institution provided that (A) the Agent has approved the identity of
any such new Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, (B)
any such new Lender assumes all of the rights and obligations
of a "Lender" hereunder, and (C) the procedure described in Section
12.4.2 has been complied with, provided further that the Aggregate
Commitment shall not at any time exceed $142,000,000 without the
approval of the Agent and all of the Lenders.
12.4.2 Procedure for Increases and Addition of New Lenders. This
Agreement permits certain increases in a Lender's Commitment and the
admission of new Lenders providing new Commitments, none of which
require any consents or approvals from the other Lenders. Any amendment
hereto for such an increase or addition shall be in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit "K" and shall only require the written signatures of
the Agent, the Borrowers and the Lender(s) being added or increasing
their Commitment, subject only to the approval of all Lenders if any
such increase would cause the Aggregate Commitment to exceed
$142,000,000. In addition, within a reasonable time after the effective
date of any increase, the Agent shall, and is hereby authorized and
directed to, revise Schedule "2" reflecting such increase and shall
distribute such revised Schedule to each of the Lenders and the
Borrowers, whereupon such revised Schedule shall replace the old
Schedule and become part of this Agreement. On the Business Day
following any such increase, all outstanding Fed Funds Advances and
Alternate Base Rate Advances shall be reallocated among the Lenders
(including any newly added Lenders) in accordance with the Lenders'
respective revised Primary Commitment Percentages. Eurodollar Advances
shall not be reallocated among the Lenders prior to the expiration of
the applicable Interest Period in effect at the time of any such
increase.
12.5 Dissemination of Information. The Borrowers authorize each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person
acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all
information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness
of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, including without limitation
any information contained in any Reports; provided that each Transferee
and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.12 of
this Agreement.
12.6 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of
Section 3.5(iv).

ARTICLE XV
CHOICE OF LAW, CONSENT TO JURISDICTION, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
15.1 CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE
CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW
OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS
APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.
15.2 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. EACH BORROWER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED
STATES FEDERAL OR TEXAS STATE COURT SITTING IN DALLAS IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
THE BORROWERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT
033544 000195 DALLAS 1532102 4.DOC 75 FIRST RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT
AGREEMENT
OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY
SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE
AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWERS IN
THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE
BORROWERS AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE
AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER
IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN DALLAS, TEXAS.
15.3 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH
LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN
TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO,
OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP
ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.
15.4 No Tri-Party Accounts. Section 346 of the Texas Finance Code
(which regulates certain revolving loan accounts and revolving triparty
accounts) shall not apply to this Agreement or the other loan
documents.
15.5 Limitation on Interest. The Agent, the Lenders, and the Borrowers,
and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in
strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in
effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipula te and agree that
none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall
ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance
or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of
interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time in
effect. Neither the Borrowers nor any present or future guarantors,
endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of
any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest
thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of
the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under applicable law
from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this section shall
control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in
conflict or apparent conflict herewith. The Lenders expressly disavow
any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or
finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation
is accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated
for any reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any
amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of
the legal maximum, or (c) the Lenders or any other holder of any or all
of the Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined
to constitute interest which would otherwise increase the interest on
any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of
that permitted to be charged by applicable law then in effect, then all
such sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal
limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then
outstanding principal of the related Obligations or, at the Lenders' or
such holder's option, promptly returned to each Borrower or the other
payor thereof upon such determination. In determining whether or not
the interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstance, exceeds
the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, the Lenders and the
Borrowers (and any other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent
permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal
payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii)
exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii)
amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest
throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing
the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to
time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to
time in effect under applicable law in order to lawfully charge the
maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law. In the event
applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Section 303 of
the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling.
15.6 NO ORAL AGREEMENTS. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.
THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

its entirety the Original Credit Agreement.]

FORM OF OPINION
March 7, 2003
The Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the
First Restated Revolving Credit Agreement described below.
Gentlemen/Ladies:
We are counsel for K. Hovnanian Mortgage, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation, and K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, L.L.C., a New Jersey
limited liability company (collective, the "Borrowers"), and Hovnanian
Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent "), and
have represented the Borrowers in connection with its execution and
delivery of a First Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of
March 7, 2003 (the "Agreement") among the Borrowers, the Lenders named
therein, and Guaranty Bank, as Agent, and providing for
Advances in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $142,000,000 at
any one time outstanding and the Parent in connection with its
execution and delivery of the First Restated Keep-Well Agreement dated
as of March 7, 2003 and the First Restated Subordination
Agreement dated as of March 7, 2003 related to the Agreement. All
capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.
We have examined the Borrowers' "(describe constitutive documents of
Borrowers and appropriate evidence of authority to enter into the
transaction) ", the Parent's "(describe constitutive documents of
Borrowers and appropriate evidence of authority to enter into the
Transaction)", the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact and
law which we deem necessary in order to render this opinion. Based upon
the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
1. Each of the Parent, the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly and properly
incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to
the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and
has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is cond ucted.
2. A. The execution and delivery by each Borrower of the Loan Documents
to which it is a party and the performance by such Borrower of its
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings on the part of such Borrower and will not:
(a) require any consent of such Borrower's shareholders or members
(other than any such consent as has already been given and remains in
full force and effect);
(b) violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on such Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) such Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or
certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of
partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by- laws, or
operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii)
the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which such
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by
which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a
default thereunder; or
(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in,
of or on the Property of such Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the
terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon such
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
B. The execution and delivery by the Parent of the Loan Documents to
which it is a party and the performance by the Parent of its
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings on the part of the Parent and will not:
(a) require any consent of the Parent's shareholders or members (other
than any such consent as has already been given and remains in full
force and effect);
(b) violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) the Parent's or any of its Subsidiary's articles
or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement,
certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by
laws, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be,
or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to
which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder; or
(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in,
of or on the Property of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
3. A. The Loan Documents to which each Borrower is a party have been
duly executed and delivered by such Borrower and constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against suc
h Borrower in accordance with their terms except to the
extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if
equitable remedies are sought.
B. The Loan Documents to which the Parent is a party have been duly
executed and delivered by the Parent and constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Parent enforceable against the Parent in
accordance with their terms except to the extent the
enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable
remedies are sought.
4. There is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation,
proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the best of our knowledge after
due inquiry, threatened against the Parent, the Borrowers or any of
their Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization,
or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or
exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public
body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been
obtained by the Parent, the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, is
required to be obtained by the Parent, the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement, the payment and
performance by the Borrowers of the Secured Obligations, or the
legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan
Documents.
6. The Secured Obligations constitute senior indebtedness which is
entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions contained in
the Subordination Agreement.
7. The provisions of the Collateral Documents are sufficient to create
in favor of the Lenders a security interest in all right, title and
interest of the Borrowers in those items and types of collateral
described in the Collateral Documents in which a security interest may
be created under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect
from time to time in New Jersey and Delaware, as applicable. Financing
statements on Form UCC-l's have been duly executed by the Borrowers and
have been duly filed in each filing office indicated in Exhibit A
hereto under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in each state in
which said filing offices are located. The description of the
collateral set forth in said financing statements is sufficient to
perfect a security interest in the items and types of collateral
described therein in which a security interest may be perfected by the
filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect from time to time in such states. Such filings are sufficient to
perfect the security interest created by the Collateral Documents in
all right, title and interest of the Borrowers in those items and types
of collateral described in the Collateral Documents in which a security
interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under
the Uniform Commercial Code from time to time in effect in such states,
except that we express no opinion as to personal property affixed to
real property in such manner as to become a fixture under the laws of
any state in which the collateral may be located and we call your
attention tothe fact that the Lenders' security interest in certain of
such collateral may not be perfected by filing financing statements
under the Uniform Commercial Code.
This opinion may be relied upon by the Agent, the Lenders and their
participants, assignees and other transferees.
Very truly yours,

ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT
This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
(the "Assignor") and            (the "Assignee") is dated as of
         , 200 . The parties hereto agree as follows:
1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Assignor is a party to the First Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement (which, as it may be amended, modified,
renewed or extended from time to time is herein called the "Credit
Agreement") described in Item 1 of Schedule 1 attached hereto
("Schedule 1). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit
Agreement.
2. ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to
the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the
Assignor, an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations
under the Credit Agreement such that after giving effect to such
assignment the Assignee shall have purchased pursuant to this
Assignment Agreement the percentage interest specified in Item 3 of
Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and
obligations under the Credit Agreement relating to the facilities
listed in Item 3 of Schedule 1 and the other Loan Documents. The
aggregate Commitment (or Loans, if the applicable Commitment has been
terminated) purchased by the Assignee hereunder is set forth in Item 4
of Schedule 1.
3. EFFECTIVE DATE. The effective date of this Assignment Agreement (the
"Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in Item 5 of
Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by
the Agent) after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of
Annex "I" attached hereto has been delivered to the Agent. Such Notice
of Assignment must include any consents required to be delivered to the
Agent by Section 12.3.1 of the Credit Agreement. In no event will the
Effective Date occur if the payments required to be made by the
Assignee to the Assignor on the Effective Date under Sections 4 and 5
hereof are not made on the proposed Effective Date. The Assignor will
notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective Date no later than the
Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date. As of the
Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall have the rights and obligations
of a Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to the rights and
obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the Assignor
shall relinquish its rights and be released from its corresponding
obligations under the Loan Documents with respect to the rights and
obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder.
4. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. On and after the Effective Date, the Assignee
shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments of principal,
interest and fees with respect to the interest assigned hereby. The
Assignee shall advance funds directly to the Agent with respect to all
Loans and reimbursement payments made on or after the Effective Date
with respect to the interest assigned hereby. **[In consideration for
the sale and assignment of Loans hereunder, (i) the Assignee shall pay
the Assignor, on the Effective Date, an amount equal to the
principal amount of the portion of all Alternate Base Rate Loans
assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) with respect to each
Eurodollar Loan made by the Assignor and assigned to the Assignee
hereunder which is outstanding on the Effective Date, (a) on the last
day of the Interest Period therefor or (b) on such earlier date agreed
to by the Assignor and the Assignee or (c) on the date on which any
such Eurodollar Loan becomes due (by acceleration or otherwise)
(the date as described in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c) being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Date"), the Assignee shall pay
the Assignor an amount equal to the principal amount of the portion of
such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the Assignee which is outstanding on
the Payment Date. If the Assignor and the Assignee agree that the
Payment Date for such Eurodollar Loan shall be the Effective Date, they
shall agree to the interest rate applicable to the portion of such Loan
assigned hereunder for the period from the Effective Date to the end of
the existing Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (the
"Agreed Interest Rate") and any interest received by the Assignee in
excess of the Agreed Interest Rate shall be remitted to the
Assignor. In the event interest for the period from the Effective Date
to but not including the Payment Date is not paid by the Borrowers with
respect to any Eurodollar Loan sold by the Assignor to the Assignee
hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor interest for such
period on the portion of such Eurodollar Loan sold by the Assignor to
the Assignee hereunder at the applicable rate provided by the Credit
Agreement. In the event a prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan which is
existing on the Payment Date and assigned by the Assignor to the
Assignee hereunder occurs after the Payment Date but before the end of
the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, the Assignee
shall remit to the Assignor the excess of the prepayment penalty paid
with respect to the portion of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the
Assignee hereunder over the amount which would have been paid if such
prepayment penalty was calculated based on the Agreed Interest Rate.
The Assignee will also promptly remit to the Assignor (i) any principal
payments received from the Agent with respect to Eurodollar Loans
prior to the Payment Date and (ii) any amounts of interest on Loans and
fees received from the Agent which relate to the portion of the Loans
assigned to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to the Effective
Date, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans or fees, or the Payment
Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and not previously paid by the
Assignee to the Assignor.]** In the event that either party hereto
receives any payment to which the other party hereto is entitled under
this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving such amount shall
promptly remit it to the other party hereto.
**Each Assignor may insert its standard payment provisions in lieu of
the payment terms included in this Exhibit.
5. FEES PAYABLE BY THE ASSIGNEE. The Assignee shall pay to the Assignor
a fee on each day on which a payment of interest or fees is made under
the Credit Agreement with respect to the amounts assigned to the
Assignee hereunder (other than a payment of interest or commitment fees
for the period prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, the Payment Date, which the Assignee is obligated to
deliver to the Assignor pursuant to Section 4 hereof). The amount of
such fee shall be the difference between (i) the interest or fee,
as applicable, paid with respect to the amounts assigned to the
Assignee hereunder and (ii) the interest or fee, as applicable, which
would have been paid with respect to the amounts assigned
to the Assignee hereunder if each interest rate was      of 1% less
than the interest rate paid by the Borrowers or if the commitment fee
was       of 1% less than the commitment fee paid by the
Borrowers, as applicable. In addition, the Assignee agrees to pay    %
of the recordation fee required to be paid to the Agent in connection
with this Assignment Agreement.
6. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNOR; LIMITATIONS ON THE ASSIGNOR'S
LIABILITY. The Assignor represents and warrants that it is the legal
and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and
that such interest is free and clear of any adverse claim created by
the Assignor. It is understood and agreed that the assignment and
assumption hereunder are made without recourse to the Assignor and that
the Assignor makes no other representation or warranty of any kind to
the Assignee. Neither the Assignor nor any of its officers, directors,

security interest in assets of the Borrowers or any guarantor, (ii) any
representation, warranty or statement made in or in connection with any

Loans or (vii) any mistake, error of judgment, or action
taken or omitted to be taken in connection with the Loans or the Loan
Documents.
7. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNEE. The Assignee (i) confirms that it
has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements requested by the Assignee and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Assignment

(iv) agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of
the obligations which by the terms of the Loan Documents are required
to be performed by it as a Lender, (v) agrees that its payment
instructions and notice instructions are as set forth in the attachment
to Schedule 1,
(vi) confirms that none of the funds, monies, assets or other
consideration being used to make the purchase and assumption hereunder
are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that its rights,
benefits and interests in and under the Loan Documents will not be
"plan assets" under ERISA, **[(vii) confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee,]** **[and (viii) attaches the forms prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying that the
Assignee is entitled to receive payments under the Loan Documents
