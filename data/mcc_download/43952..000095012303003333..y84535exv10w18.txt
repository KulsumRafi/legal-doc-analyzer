                                 NOTE AGREEMENT

          THIS THIRD AMENDMENT TO NOTE AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is entered
into as of March 14, 2003 between THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA

          WHEREAS, the Company and Prudential are parties to that certain Note

          WHEREAS, the Company and Prudential have agreed to certain amendments
to the Note Agreement, subject to certain limitations and conditions, as
provided for herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.        Amendments to Note Agreement.      Prudential and the Company hereby
          -----------------------------      agree as follows:


         (a)   Paragraph 5A of the Note Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety, and replaced with the following new Paragraph 5A, in it's entirety:

               "5A. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company covenants that it will
          deliver to each holder of Notes in quadruplicate:

                    (i) as soon as practicable and in any event within 60 days
               after the end of each quarterly period (other than the last
               quarterly period) in each fiscal year, consolidated statements of
               income and cash flows and a consolidated statement of
               stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
               period from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the end
               of such quarterly period, and a consolidated balance sheet of the
               Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of such quarterly
               period, setting forth in each case in comparative form figures
               for the corresponding period in the preceding fiscal year, all in
               reasonable detail and substantially in the same form as at the
               time required for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the
               Securities and Exchange Commission and certified by an authorized
               financial officer of the Company, subject to changes resulting
               from year-end adjustments; provided, however, that delivery
               pursuant to clause (iii) below of copies of the Quarterly Report
               on Form 10-Q of the Company for such quarterly period filed with
               the Securities and Exchange Commission shall be deemed to satisfy
               the requirements of this clause (i);

                    (ii) as soon as practicable and in any event within 90 days
               after the end of each fiscal year, consolidated statements of
               income and cash flows and a consolidated statement of
               stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
<PAGE>

               such year, and a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
               its Subsidiaries as at the end of such year, setting forth in
               each case in comparative form corresponding consolidated figures
               from the preceding annual audit, all in reasonable detail and
               substantially in the same form as at the time required for Annual
               Reports on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
               Commission and reported on by independent public accountants of
               recognized national standing selected by the Company whose report
               shall be without limitation as to the scope of the audit;
               provided, however, that delivery pursuant to clause (iii) below
               of copies of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for
               such fiscal year filed with the Securities and Exchange
               Commission shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
               clause (ii);

                    (iii) promptly upon transmission thereof, copies of all such
               financial statements, proxy statements, notices and reports as it
               shall send to its public stockholders and copies of all
               registration statements (without exhibits) and all reports which
               it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any
               governmental body or agency succeeding to the functions of the
               Securities and Exchange Commission);

                    (iv) promptly upon receipt thereof, a final copy of each
               other report submitted to the Company by independent accountants
               in connection with any annual audit made by them of the books of
               the Company, and notice of the submission by independent
               accountants of any final report in connection with any interim or
               special audit of the books of the Company or any of its
               Subsidiaries; and

                    (v) if such holder is a Significant Holder, with reasonable
               promptness, such other financial data as such Significant Holder
               may reasonably request.

               Together with each delivery of financial statements required by
               clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Company will deliver to each
               holder of Notes an Officer's Certificate demonstrating (with
               computations in reasonable detail) compliance by the Company and
               its Subsidiaries with the provisions of paragraphs 6A
               (identifying the nature of any Liens permitted by the provisions
               of paragraph 6A (vi) or (vii) securing Debt in excess of
               $250,000), 6B, 6C, 6D, 6F and 6G, stating that there exists no
               Event of Default or Default, or, if any Event of Default or
               Default exists, specifying the nature and period of existence
               thereof and what action the Company proposes to take with respect
               thereto, and stating further that, to the best of such officer's
               knowledge, the Company during such period has observed or
               performed all its covenants and other agreements, and satisfied
               every condition contained in this Agreement or the Notes to be
               performed, observed or satisfied by it. Together with each
               delivery of financial statements required by clause (ii) above,
               the Company will deliver to each holder of the Notes a
               certificate of such accountants stating that, in making the audit
               necessary for their report on such financial statements, they
               have obtained no knowledge of any Event of Default or Default,
               or, if they have obtained knowledge of any Event of Default or
               Default, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof.
               Such accountants, however, shall not be liable to anyone by
               reason of their failure to obtain knowledge of any Event of
               Default or Default which would not be disclosed in the course of
               an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing
               standards.

               The Company also covenants that:

                                       2

               knowledge of an Event of Default or Default, it will deliver to
               each holder of Notes an Officer's Certificate specifying the
               nature and period of existence thereof and what action the
               Company proposes to take with respect thereto; and

               (B) it will promptly deliver notice (accompanied in each case by
               an Officer's Certificate specifying the nature and period of
               existence of such event or circumstances and what action the
               Company proposes to take with respect thereto) to each
               Significant Holder of Notes of:

                    (1) any (a) default or event of default under any
               contractual obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary or (b)
               litigation, investigation or proceeding that may exist at any
               time between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Governmental
               Authority, that, in either case, if not cured or if adversely
               determined, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to
               have a material adverse effect on the business, condition
               (financial or otherwise) or operations of the Company and its
               Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                    (2) any litigation or proceeding affecting the Company or
               any Subsidiary (a) in which the amount involved is $10,000,000
               (or the equivalent) or more and not covered by insurance, (b) in
               which injunctive or similar relief is sought, or (c) which
               relates to this Agreement or the Notes; and

                    (3) any development or event that has or could reasonably be
               expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
               condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of the Company
               and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.".

         (b)   Paragraph 5D of the Note Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
the word "corporations" at the end thereof, and replacing it with the following,
in it's entirety: "companies and, to the extent such self insurance is included,
such self insurance shall be maintained and funded, if applicable, in accordance
with the customary practices for such self-insurance programs)".

         (c)   Paragraphs 5F and 5G of the Note Agreement are hereby deleted in
their entirety, and replaced with the following new Paragraphs 5F and 5G, in
their entirety:

               "5F. PAYMENT OF TAXES, CLAIMS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS. The Company

          assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon it or any of
          its properties or assets or in respect of any of its franchises,
          business, income or property, and all of it's other material
          obligations of whatever nature, before any penalty or significant
          interest accrues thereon, and all claims (including, without
          limitation, claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for
          sums which have become due and payable and which by law have or may
          become a Lien upon any of its properties or assets if the failure to
          pay such tax, assessment, charge or claim would result in liability to
          the Company or a Subsidiary and would materially adversely affect the
          business, condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of the
          Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, that no such
          charge or claim need be paid if being contested in good faith by
          appropriate proceedings and if such accrual, reserve or other
          appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required by generally
          accepted accounting principles shall have been made therefor.

          (financial or other) or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
          taken as a whole. The Company will promptly give notice to each
          Significant Holder of any of the following events, in each case as
          soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after the Company
          knows or has reason to know thereof: (i) the occurrence of any
          Reportable Event with respect to any Plan, a failure to make any
          required contribution to a Plan, the creation of any Lien in favor of
          the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (or any successor) or a Plan
          or any withdrawal from, or the termination, Reorganization or
          Insolvency of, any Multiemployer Plan, or (ii) the institution of any
          proceedings or the taking of any other action by the Pension Benefit
          Guaranty Corporation (or any successor) or the Company or any ERISA

          Certificate specifying the nature and period of existence of such
          occurrence and what action the Company proposes to take with respect
          thereto.".

amended by deleting the text "$40,000,000" set forth therein and replacing it
with the following: "$50,000,000".

          (e)  Paragraph 6B of the Note Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety, and replaced with the following new Paragraph 6B, in its entirety:

               "6B. LIMITATION ON TOTAL BORROWED FUNDS. The Company will not at
          any time permit Total Borrowed Funds to exceed 125% of Consolidated
          Net Worth; provided, that, for purposes of determining compliance with
          the foregoing limitation, the amount of `total assets' of the Company
          and its Subsidiaries used to determine Consolidated Net Worth shall be
          adjusted upward to add-back (to the extent otherwise reduced thereby)
          amounts (net of taxes) in respect of non-cash charges relating to
          write-downs of investments in internet-related businesses made prior
          to January 1, 2001; provided further, that, the aggregate amount of
