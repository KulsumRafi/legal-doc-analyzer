                                                                        12/28/02


                          AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     This Amendment is entered into as of December 30, 2002 by and between SIGHT
RESOURCE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and AMERICAN STOCK
TRANSFER & TRUST COMPANY (the "Rights Agent").

     WHEREAS the Company and the Rights Agent have entered into that certain
Rights Agreement, dated as of May 15, 1997 (the "Rights Agreement");

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized and directed
the Company to execute and deliver this Amendment to the Rights Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, the Company and the Rights Agent are authorized to execute and
deliver this Amendment pursuant to the provisions of Section 27 of the Rights
Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

     Section 1. Amendment to Rights Agreement. The definition of "Acquiring
Person" as set forth in Section 1 of the Rights Agreement is amended by deleting
the first two sentences thereof and substituting in lieu thereof the following:

     "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who or which, together with all
     Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of
     15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall
     not include (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any
     employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or
     (iv) any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any
     such employee benefit plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no person
     shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of
     Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares
     outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially
     owned by such Person to 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company
     then outstanding, provided, however, that if a Person shall so become the
     Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then
     outstanding by reason of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company and
     shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial
     Owner of an additional 1% of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company,
     then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person"; (2) if the
     Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person
     who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the
     foregoing provisions of this paragraph, has become such inadvertently, and
     such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of
     Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person,"
     as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then
     such Person shall not be deemed to have become an "Acquiring Person" for
     any purposes of this Agreement; (3) none of Carlyle Venture Partners, L.P.,
     Carlyle U.S. Venture Partners, L.P., C/S Venture





<PAGE>

     Investors, L.P., Carlyle Venture Coinvestment, LLC ("The Carlyle Group")
     nor any of their Affiliates shall be deemed to have become an "Acquiring
     Person" for any purposes of this Agreement solely as the result of the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by Series B Convertible
     Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of October 9, 1997 (the
     "Purchase Agreement"), including, without limitation, the purchase of
     shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
     share, of the Company (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and the issuance of
     Common Shares upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and upon
     the exercise of the warrants issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
     provided, however, that the foregoing exception shall not apply if The
     Carlyle Group or any of its Affiliates becomes the Beneficial Owner of 15%
     or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding in any manner
     other than as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement or approved in advance
     by the Board of Directors of the Company; (4) no Purchaser (as that term is
     defined in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Company,
     eyeshop.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Eyeshop.com") and certain
     purchasers of Company common stock, dated as of May 23, 2001 (the "Stock
     Purchase Agreement")) listed on Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement
     shall be deemed to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of
     this Agreement solely as the result of the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Agreement and Plan of
     Merger, by and among the Company, Eyeshop.com and Eyeshop Acquisition
     Corporation, a Delaware corporation, dated May 23, 2001 (the "Merger
     Agreement"), including, without limitation, the purchase of Common Shares;
     (5) no shareholder of Eyeshop.com who receives shares of Common Shares as a
     result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Stock
     Purchase Agreement and the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to have become
     an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement; (6) no Person
     who, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement between the Company and
     such person entered into between April 2, 2001 and September 30, 2001,
     purchases Common Shares for up to, but not exceeding, $2,500,000 shall be
     deemed to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this
     Agreement; (7) no Person who, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
     between the Company and such Person entered into between December 30, 2002
     and January 31, 2003, purchases Common Shares for up to, but not exceeding,
     $3,000,000 shall thereby be deemed to have become an "Acquiring Person" for
     any purposes of this Agreement; (8) neither The Carlyle Group nor any of
     its Affiliates shall be deemed to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any
     purposes of this Agreement upon the issuance of Common Shares (i) in
     payment of dividends owing on the Series B Preferred Stock, or (ii) upon
     conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into Common Shares; and (9) no
     Person who, pursuant to a certain Put and Right of First Refusal Agreement
     to be executed between December 30, 2002 and January 31, 2003 among certain
     stockholders (or their affiliates) of the Company, purchases Common Shares
     shall thereby be deemed to have become an Acquiring Person for any purposes
     of this Agreement. Common Shares acquired by any Person or group of Persons
     pursuant to the transactions described in clauses (3) through (9) shall,
     for purposes of determining whether any Person or group of Persons is an
     Acquiring


                                       2

     Person, be excluded in the determination of the number of Common Shares of
     which such Person or group is the Beneficial Owner.

     Section 2. Rights Agent. In accordance with the provisions of Section 27 of
the Rights Agreement, upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate
officer of the Company that states that this Amendment is in compliance with the
terms of Section 27 of the Rights Agreement, the Rights Agent shall execute this
Amendment, shall be under no obligation to investigate such compliance, and
shall be fully protected hereunder and thereunder by so doing.

     Section 3. Effect of Amendment. The parties hereby ratify and confirm all
of the provisions of the Rights Agreement, as amended hereby, and agree and
acknowledge that the Rights Agreement as so amended remains in full force and
effect.
