                            MOCON INCENTIVE PAY PLAN


              RESOLUTION OF THE MOCON, INC. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     WHEREAS, the current MOCON Incentive Pay Plan covering 1999 and future
years was adopted on January 11, 1999; and

     WHEREAS, the Company has made acquisitions since the adoption of the
current Incentive Pay Plan, and it has been determined that it is desirable to
modify the Incentive Pay Plan for 2003 and future years.

     NOW, THEREFORE, be it hereby resolved, that the MOCON Incentive Pay Plan
for 2003 and subsequent years is as set forth in the following provisions, with
the proviso that these provisions shall be reviewed and modified by the
Compensation Committee as considered necessary;

     1)   This Incentive Pay Plan (the "Plan") covers employees of MOCON, Inc.
          and its subsidiaries who do not have a variable compensation component
          based on sales.

     2)   The incentive as a percentage of salary at goal for all MOCON, Inc.
          officers will be determined by the Compensation Committee; the actual
          incentive paid will be based on the percentage of goal achieved, up to
          a maximum of one hundred fifty percent.

     3)   The profit goal amounts for the CEO and all other MOCON, Inc. officers
          will be determined annually by the Compensation Committee.

     4)   The incentive as a percentage of salary at goal for all participants
          in this Plan who are not an officer of MOCON, Inc. will be determined
          by the CEO; the actual incentive paid will be based on the percentage
          of goal achieved, up to a maximum of one hundred fifty percent.

     5)   The goals for all non-MOCON, Inc. officer Company employees will be
          determined by the CEO.

     6)   The incentives, if any, for the CEO and all other MOCON, Inc. officers
          who are not in charge of specific business units, will be paid
          annually on or before March 15th of the year following the end of each
          Plan year. The frequency and timing of the incentive payments for all
          other participants in this Plan will be determined by the CEO.

     7)   The combined total of all incentives paid each year under this Plan to
          the CEO, other MOCON, Inc. officers, and all participants who are not
          officers of MOCON, Inc. shall not exceed eleven percent of the
          Company's consolidated actual net income before income taxes and
          before incentives for the year to which the incentives relate. If the
          total of all incentives, before adjustment, exceeds eleven percent,
          the total annual incentive amounts for all employees will be reduced,
          on a pro rata basis, to the extent necessary to meet the eleven
          percent limit.


Effective date:  January 1, 2003
