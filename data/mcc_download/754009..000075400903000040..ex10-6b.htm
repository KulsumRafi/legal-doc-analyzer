<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<P align=center>Purpose</P>
<P>The purpose of this Plan is to provide specified benefits to a select group
of management or highly compensated Employees who contribute materially to the
continued growth, development and future business success of the Sierra Health
Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries (including lower-tier
subsidiaries), if any, that sponsor this Plan. This Plan shall be unfunded for

(i) the Deferral Account plus (ii) the Vested Company Matching Account plus
(iii) the Vested Company Restoration Account. This account shall be a
bookkeeping entry only and shall be utilized solely as a device for the
measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to a Participant
pursuant to this Plan.</P>
<P>1.2 "Annual Bonus" shall mean any annual cash compensation in addition to
Base Annual Salary relating to services performed during any calendar year,
whether or not paid in such calendar year or included on the Federal Income Tax

any Employer's annual bonus and incentive plans, including any such bonuses
payable to physician employees.</P>
<P>1.3 "Annual Company Matching Amount" for any one Plan Year shall be the
amount determined in accordance with Section 3.5.</P>
<P>1.4 "Annual Company Restoration Amount" for any one Plan Year shall be the
amount determined in accordance with Section 3.6.</P></DIR></DIR>

Year, such year's Annual Deferral Amount shall be the actual amount withheld
prior to such event.</P>

Salary shall be calculated before reduction for compensation voluntarily
deferred or contributed by the Participant pursuant to all qualified or
non-qualified plans and shall be calculated to include amounts not otherwise
included in the Participant's gross income under Code Sections 125, 402(e)(3),
or 402(h) pursuant to plans established by any Employer; provided however that
all such amounts will be included in compensation only to the extent that, had
there been no such plan, the amount would have been payable in cash to the
Employee.</P>
<P>1.7 "Beneficiary" shall mean one or more persons, trusts, estates or other
entities, designated in accordance with Article 9, that are entitled to receive
benefits under this Plan upon the death of a Participant.</P>
<P>1.8 "Beneficiary Designation Form" shall mean the form, established from time
to time by the Committee, that a Participant completes, signs and returns to the
Committee to designate one or more Beneficiaries.</P>
<P>1.9 "Board" shall mean the board of directors of the Company.</P>

50% of the voting power of outstanding voting securities of the Company.</P>
<P>1.11 "Claimant" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 14.1.</P>

amended from time to time.</P>

12.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>1.14 "Company" shall mean Sierra Health Services, Inc., a Nevada
corporation.</P>
<P>1.15 "Company Matching Account" shall mean the sum of all of a Participant's
Annual Company Matching Amounts plus amounts credited and debited in accordance
with all the applicable crediting provisions of this Plan, less all
distributions made to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary pursuant to this
Plan that relate to his or her Company Matching Account. This account shall be a
bookkeeping entry only and shall be utilized solely as a device for the
measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to the Participant
pursuant to this Plan.</P>
<P>1.16 "Company Restoration Account" shall mean the sum of all of a
Participant's Annual Company Restoration Amounts plus amounts credited and
debited in accordance with all the applicable provisions of the Plan, less all
distributions made to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary pursuant to the
Plan that relate to his or her Company Restoration Account. This account shall
be a bookkeeping entry only and shall be utilized solely as a device for the
measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to the Participant
pursuant to this Plan.</P>
<P>1.17 "Deferral Account" shall mean the sum of all of a Participant's Annual
Deferral Amounts, plus amounts credited and debited in accordance with all the

amounts to be paid to the Participant pursuant to this Plan.</P>
<P>1.18 "Deduction Limitation" shall mean the following described limitation on
a benefit that may otherwise be distributable pursuant to the provisions of this
Plan. Except as otherwise provided, this limitation shall be applied to all
distributions that are "subject to the Deduction Limitation" under this Plan. If
an Employer determines in good faith prior to a Change in Control that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any compensation paid to a Participant for a
taxable year of the Employer would not be deductible by the Employer solely by
reason of the limitation under Code Section 162(m), then to the extent deemed
necessary by the Employer to ensure that the entire amount of any distribution
to the Participant pursuant to this Plan prior to the Change in Control is
deductible, the Employer may defer all or any portion of a distribution under
this Plan. Any amounts deferred pursuant to this limitation shall be credited
and debited with additional amounts in accordance with Section 3.8 below, even
if such amount is being paid out in installments. The amounts so deferred
adjusted to reflect amounts credited and debited thereon shall be distributed to
the Participant or his or her Beneficiary (in the event of the Participant's
death) at the earliest possible date, as determined by the Employer in good
faith, on which the deductibility of compensation paid or payable to the
Participant for the taxable year of the Employer during which the distribution
is made will not be limited by Section 162(m), or if earlier, the effective date
of a Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan,
the Deduction Limitation shall not apply to any distributions made after a
Change in Control.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>1.19 "Disability" shall mean a period of disability during which a
Participant qualifies for disability benefits under the Participant's Employer's
long-term disability plan, or, if a Participant does not participate in such a
plan, a period of disability during which the Participant would have qualified
for disability benefits under such a plan had the Participant been a participant
in such a plan, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. If the
Participant's Employer does not sponsor such a plan, or discontinues to sponsor
such a plan, Disability shall be determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion.</P>
<P>1.20 "Disability Benefit" shall mean the benefit set forth in Article 8.</P>
<P>1.21 "Election Form" shall mean the form established from time to time by the
Committee that a Participant completes, signs and returns to the Committee to

Company.</P></DIR></DIR>

<DIR>
<P>1.26 "Monthly Installment Method" shall be an installment payment method over
the duration selected by the Participant in accordance with this Plan,
calculated as follows: The Participant's Account Balance, as of the date of the
Participant's Retirement, death, Disability or Termination of Employment, shall
be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 1 and the denominator of
which is the number of periods over which the installment payments shall be
paid. The result of this multiplication shall be the amount of each installment
payment for the Plan Year in which the Participant Retired, died, suffered a
Disability or experienced a Termination of Employment and this amount shall be
paid starting on the first day of the month following the Participant's
Retirement, Death, Disability or Termination of Employment and shall continue to
be paid on the first day of each month thereafter during that Plan Year. For
each subsequent Plan Year during the installment payment period, the
Participant's Account Balance shall be determined as of January 1 of that Plan
Year, in accordance with Section 3.8, after taking into account all previous
installment payments, and such balance shall be multiplied by the fraction
described above, except that the denominator shall be the number of remaining
periods over which the installment payments are to be paid. The resulting amount
shall be the amount of each installment payment for the Plan Year, which amount
shall be paid on the first day of each month during the Plan Year. If a
Participant has a positive Account Balance after the end of the elected
installment payment period, the remaining Account Balance shall be paid in a
lump sum on the first day of the month following the month in which the
installment period ends. If any installment, if paid, would reduce the
Participant's Account Balance to zero or below, that installment payment shall
be reduced so that the Participant's Account Balance does not go below zero and
all future installment payments shall cease.</P>

to participate in the Plan, (ii) who elects to participate in the Plan, (iii)
who signs a Plan Agreement, an Election Form and a Beneficiary Designation Form,

Participant shall not be treated as a Participant in the Plan, even if he or she
has an interest in the Participant's benefits under the Plan under applicable
law or as a result of property settlements resulting from legal separation or
divorce.</P>
<P>1.28 "Plan" shall mean the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, which shall
be evidenced by this instrument and by each Plan Agreement, as they may be
amended from time to time.</P>
<P>1.29 "Plan Agreement" shall mean a written agreement, as may be amended from

Participant. The terms of any Plan Agreement may vary any of the terms set forth
in this Plan and such changes shall be binding on the Employer and the
Participant if the Plan Agreement is signed by the Participant and accepted by
the Employer. The Plan Agreement executed by a Participant and accepted by the
Employer shall provide for the entire benefit to which such Participant is
entitled under the Plan; should there be more than one Plan Agreement, the Plan
Agreement bearing the latest date of acceptance by the Employer shall supersede
all previous Plan Agreements in their entirety and shall govern the agreement
between the parties.</P>

emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the Participant that
would result in severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from (i)
a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or a dependent of
the Participant, (ii) a loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or
(iii) such other extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a
result of events beyond the control of the Participant, all as determined in the
sole discretion of the Committee.</P>

<P align=center>ARTICLE 2 </P>
<P>
<P align=center>Selection, Enrollment, Eligibility</P>
<DIR>

<P>2.1 <U>Selection by Committee</U>. Participation in the Plan shall be limited
to a select group of management or highly compensated Employees of the
Employers, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. From that
group, the Committee shall select, in its sole discretion, Employees to
participate in the Plan. For this purpose, the term "highly compensated" shall
be interpreted in a manner consistent with regulations and other guidance under
the Code.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>2.2 <U>Enrollment Requirements</U>. As a condition to participation, each
selected Employee shall complete, execute and return to the Committee, within 30
days of selection, a Plan Agreement, an Election Form and a Beneficiary
Designation Form. In addition, the Committee shall establish from time to time
such other enrollment requirements as it determines in its sole discretion are
necessary.</P>
<P>2.3 <U>Eligibility; Commencement of Participation</U>. Provided an Employee
selected to participate in the Plan has met all enrollment requirements set
forth in this Plan and required by the Committee, including returning all
required documents to the Committee within 30 days of selection, that Employee
shall commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the next month
which begins following the date the Employee completes all enrollment
requirements. If an Employee fails to meet all such requirements within the
required 30 day period, that Employee shall not be eligible to participate in
the Plan until the first day of a month during the Plan Year following the
delivery to and acceptance by the Committee of the required documents.</P>
<P>2.4 <U>Termination of Participation and/or Deferrals</U>. If the Committee
determines in good faith that a Participant no longer qualifies as a member of a
select group of management or highly compensated employees, as membership in
such group is determined in accordance with Section 2.1 or otherwise under
Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, the Committee shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to (i) terminate any deferral election the
Participant has made for the Plan Year in which the Participant's membership
status changes, (ii) prevent the Participant from making future deferral
elections and/or (iii) immediately distribute the Participant's then Account
Balance, determined as if there has occurred a Termination of Employment and
terminate the Participant's participation in the Plan. If the Committee chooses
to terminate the Participant's participation in the Plan, the Committee may, in
its sole discretion, reinstate the Participant to full Plan participation at
such time in the future as the Participant again becomes a member of the select
group described above. The foregoing notwithstanding, if the Participant ceases
to qualify as "highly compensated" under Section 2.1, the Committee may permit
the Participant to continue participation for a reasonable period thereafter in
order to permit the Participant an opportunity to reattain "highly compensated"
status.</P>

Annual Deferral Amount, Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus that accrue after
the date of entry into the Plan, a dollar amount up to an amount equal to the
limits set forth in Section 3.2(a) above multiplied by such Participant's total
amount of Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus for the entire Plan
Year.</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>3.3 <U>Election to Defer; Effect of Election Form</U>.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(a) <U>First Plan Year</U>. In connection with a Participant's commencement
of participation in the Plan, the Participant shall make an irrevocable deferral
election for the Plan Year in which the Participant commences participation in
the Plan, along with such other elections as the Committee deems necessary or
desirable under the Plan. For these elections to be valid, the Election Form
must be completed and signed by the Participant, timely delivered to the
Committee (in accordance with Section 2.3 above), and accepted by the
Committee.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<OL type=a start=2>
  <OL type=a><U>
    <LI>Subsequent Plan Years</U>. For each succeeding Plan Year, an irrevocable
    deferral election for that Plan Year, and such other elections as the
    Committee deems necessary or desirable under the Plan, shall be made by
    timely delivering to the Committee, in accordance with its rules and
    procedures, before the end of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year for
    which the election is made, a new Election Form. If no such Election Form is
    timely delivered for a Plan Year, no Annual Deferral Amount shall be
    withheld for that Plan Year.</LI></OL></OL><U>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR></U>
<P>A Participant may amend his or her Election Form for a particular Plan Year
to increase the amount of deferral, one time during the Plan Year, only as
provided in this paragraph. For the amended Election Form to be valid, the
amended Election Form must be completed and signed by the Participant, delivered
to the Committee, and accepted by the Committee. The Committee has sole
discretion to accept, reject, or otherwise rule on the amended Election Form.
The deferral amount or percentage that the Participant includes on his or her
reused Election Form, shall be limited to the portion of such Participant's Base
Annual Salary not yet earned by the Participant as of the date the Participant
submits the revised Election Form to the Committee for
acceptance.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>3.4 <U>Withholding of Annual Deferral Amounts</U>. For each Plan Year, the
Base Annual Salary portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld in
equal amounts from each regularly scheduled Base Annual Salary payroll,
commencing at the earliest practicable payroll after participation begins. The
Annual Bonus portion of the Annual Deferral Amount shall be withheld at the time
the Annual Bonus is or otherwise would be paid to the Participant, whether or
not this occurs during the Plan Year itself.</P>
<P>3.5 <U>Annual Company Matching Amount</U>. With respect to Plan Years prior
to and including the 1999 Plan Year, if, and only if, a Participant participates
in the 401(k) Plan to the maximum extent possible under the limits applicable to
the Plan for the Plan Year, the Participant's Annual Company Matching Amount for
such Plan Year shall be equal to 50% of the Participant's Annual Deferral Amount
for such Plan Year, up to an amount that does not exceed the lesser of 5% of the
Participant's Base Annual Salary or 50% of the IRC 402(g)(i) limit in the effect
for the Plan Year, reduced by the amount of any Company matching contributions
made to the 401(k) Plan on his or her behalf for the plan year of the 401(k)
Plan that corresponds to the Plan Year. The Annual Company Matching Amount shall
be credited to the Participant's Company Matching Account as of the first day of
February of the Plan Year following the Plan Year to which it relates.
Notwithstanding the above, if a Participant is not employed by an Employer as of
the last day of a Plan Year other than by reason of his or her Retirement,
Disability or death, the Annual Company Matching Amount for such Plan Year shall
be zero. In the event of Retirement, Disability or death, a Participant shall be
credited with the Annual Company Matching Amount for the Plan Year in which he
or she Retires, dies or becomes disabled. The foregoing notwithstanding, for any
Plan Year beginning after 1999, no Annual Company Matching Amount shall be
credited to the Participant's Company Matching Account, although prior Annual
Company Matching Amounts credited to such Account shall remain subject to the
Plan. </P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>3.6 <U>Annual Company Restoration Amount</U>. The Participant's Annual
Company Restoration Amount for each Plan Year beginning on or after January 1,
1997 shall be equal to the amount of employer contributions other than matching
contributions under the 401(k) Plan which would have been made on the
Participant's behalf and allocated to the Participant's account on or after July
1, 1997 for such Plan Year but for one or more limitations imposed by the 401(k)
Plan pursuant to the Code, including but not limited to any such amounts
resulting from the application of the compensation limitations contained in Code
Section 401(a)(17) or the limitations contained in Code Section 415. For
purposes of this Section 3.6, employer contributions under the 401(k) Plan
exclude contributions resulting from the cash or deferred arrangement under the
401(k) Plan but include contributions resulting from the reallocation of prior
employer contributions (other than matching contributions) forfeited by other
401(k) Plan participants. The Annual Company Restoration Amount shall be
credited to the Participant's Company Restoration Account as of the date or
dates such amounts would have been allocated to the Participant's account(s)
under the 401(k) Plan if such amounts had in fact been allocated under the
401(k) Plan. The foregoing notwithstanding the above, if a Participant is not
employed by an Employer as of the last day of a Plan Year other than by reason
of his or her Retirement, Disability or death, the Annual Company Restoration
Amount for such Plan Year shall be zero. In the event of Retirement, Disability
or death, a Participant shall be credited with the Annual Company Restoration
Amount for the Plan Year in which he or she Retires, dies or becomes disabled.
The Participant's Annual Company Restoration Amount for each Plan Year prior to
the Plan Year beginning January 1, 1997 shall be zero. It is understood that the
Company will discontinue employer contributions other than matching
contributions under the 401(k) Plan in Plan Years after 1999, so that no amount
will be credited as an Annual Company Restoration Amounts in respect of such
Plan Years.</P>
<P>3.7 <U>Vested Company Matching Account, Vested Company Restoration Account
and Deferral Account</U>. With respect to all benefits under this Plan other
than the Termination Benefit, a Participant's Vested Company Matching Account
shall equal 100% of such Participant's Company Matching Account and a
Participant's Vested Company Restoration Account shall equal 100% of such
Participant's Company Restoration Account. With respect to the Termination
Benefit, in the case of a Termination of Employment prior to July 1, 1999, the
vesting of a Participant's Company Matching Account and Company Restoration
Account shall be governed by the terms of this Plan as in effect at the time of
such Termination of Employment. With respect to the Termination Benefit, in the
case of a Termination of Employment on or after July 1, 1999, a Participant's
Company Matching Account and Company Restoration Account shall vest on the basis
of the Participant's Years of Service at the time the Participant experiences a
Termination of Employment, in accordance with the following schedule for
balances resulting from Company Matching Amounts and Company Restoration Amounts
for the Plan Year after 1999:</P></DIR></DIR>

Vested Company Matching Account shall equal 100% of such Participant's Company
Matching Account and a Participant's Vested Company Restoration Account shall

Deferral Account shall always be 100% vested.</P>
<P>3.8 <U>Crediting/Debiting of Account Balances</U>. In accordance with, and
subject to, the rules and procedures that are established from time to time by
the Committee, in its sole discretion, amounts shall be credited or debited to a
Participant's Account Balance (and to the Participant's Unvested Accrued
Amounts) in accordance with the following rules:</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(a) <U>Election of Measurement Funds</U>. A Participant, in connection with
his or her initial deferral election in accordance with Section 3.3(a) above,
shall elect, on the Election Form, one or more Measurement Fund(s) (as described
in Section 3.8(c) below) to be used to determine the additional amounts to be
credited or debited to his or her Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued Amounts)
from the date on which the Participant commences participation in the Plan and
continuing thereafter, unless changed in accordance with the next sentence.
Commencing with the January 1 or July 1 ("Investment Election Date") that
follows the Participant's commencement of participation in the Plan and on each
subsequent Investment Election Date during which the Participant participates in
the Plan, no later than the day before an Investment Election Date, the
Participant may (but is not required to) elect, by submitting an Election Form
to the Committee that is accepted by the Committee, to add or delete one or more
Measurement Fund(s) to be used to determine the amounts to be credited or
debited to his or her Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued Amounts), or to
change the portion of his or her Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued Amounts)
allocated to each previously or newly elected Measurement Fund. If an election
is made in accordance with the previous sentence, it shall apply to the next
Investment Election Date and continue thereafter, unless changed in accordance
with the previous sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum transfer
that may be made from the Declared Rate Measurement Fund to another Measurement
Fund in any one Plan Year cannot exceed 20% of the maximum balance in the
Participant's account in the Declared Rate Measurement Fund in the current Plan
Year and the four prior Plan Years, provided that this restriction shall no
longer apply upon termination of the Declared Rate Measurement Fund in
accordance with Section 3.8(c).</P>
<P>(b) <U>Proportionate Allocation</U>. In making any election described in
Section 3.8(a) above, the Participant shall specify on the Election Form, in
whole percentage points (1%), the percentage of his or her Account Balance (and
Unvested Accrued Amounts) to be allocated to a Measurement Fund (as if the
Participant was making an investment in that Measurement Fund with that portion
of his or her Account Balance and Unvested Accrued
Amounts).</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(c) <U>Measurement Funds</U>. The Participant may elect one or more
measurement funds, based on certain mutual funds (the "Measurement Funds"), for
the purpose of crediting or debiting amounts to his or her Account Balance (and
Unvested Accrued Amounts). The Committee shall select the mutual funds that are
to be used as Measurement Funds. As necessary, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a Measurement Fund at any time. Each
such action will take effect as of the first day of the calendar quarter that
follows by thirty (30) days the day on which the Committee gives Participants
advance written notice of such change. In addition, a Declared Rate Measurement
Fund shall be maintained until December 31, 1999, under which interest shall be
credited at a rate as specified by the Company on the November 1 of the year
prior to the Plan Year for which the amount of interest is being determined;
provided, however, that as of January 1, 2000, the Declared Rate Measurement
Fund will be terminated and all balances therein shall be transferred to such
other Measurement Funds as may have been elected by the Participant or, in the
absence of any election, to a Measurement Fund consisting of one or more
Guaranteed Interest Contracts.</P>
<P>(d) <U>Crediting or Debiting Method</U>. The performance of each selected
Measurement Fund (either positive or negative) will be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion based on the performance of the Measurement
Funds themselves or, in the case of the Declared Rate Measurement Fund (prior to
its termination), based on the amount of accrued interest credited to the fund.
A Participant's Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued Amounts) shall be credited
or debited based on such performance of the Measurement Funds as determined by
the Committee in its sole discretion. As of each Investment Election Date, the
Committee shall distribute to the Participants a statement of their respective
Account Balances (and Unvested Accrued Amounts). Furthermore, in the event of a
Participant's termination of employment or any other event requiring a
determination of the Participant's Benefit or the value of a Participant's
Account Balance, the Account Balance shall be determined based on the
performance of the relevant Measurement Fund(s) through the last date of the pay
period during which the event occurs and shall not be further adjusted
thereafter.</P>
<P>(e) <U>No Actual Investment</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Measurement Funds are to be
used for measurement purposes only, and a Participant's election of any such
Measurement Fund, the allocation to his or her Account Balance (and Unvested
Accrued Amounts) thereto, the calculation of additional amounts and the
crediting or debiting of such amounts to a Participant's Account Balance (and
Unvested Accrued Amounts) shall not be considered or construed in any manner as
an actual investment of his or her Account Balance (or Unvested Accrued Amounts)
in any such Measurement Fund. In the event that the Company or the Trustee (as
that term is defined in the Trust), in its own discretion, decides to invest
funds in any or all of the Measurement Funds, no Participant shall have any
rights in or to such investments themselves. Without limiting the foregoing, a
Participant's Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued Amounts) shall at all times
be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his
or her behalf by the Company or the Trust; the Participant shall at all times
remain an unsecured creditor of the Company.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>3.9 <U>FICA, Withholding and Other Taxes</U>. For each Plan Year in which an
Annual Deferral Amount is being withheld or an Annual Company Matching Amount or
Annual Company Restoration Amount is credited to a Participant, the
Participant's Employer(s) shall withhold from that portion of the Participant's
Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus that is not being deferred, in a manner
determined by the Employer(s), the Participant's share of FICA and other
employment taxes. If necessary, the Committee shall reduce the Annual Deferral
Amount in order to comply with this Section 3.9. In addition, the Participant's
Employer(s) or the Trust, shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant
under this Plan all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes
required to be withheld in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a
manner to be determined in the sole discretion of the Employer(s) or the
Trust.</P>
<P>3.10 <U>Rollovers From Prior Deferred Compensation Plan</U>. A Participant
who participated in the Company's prior nonqualified deferred compensation plan
shall have the right, under such rules and at such times as are prescribed by
the Committee, to roll over the benefit that the Participant is entitled to
receive pursuant to such prior nonqualified deferred compensation plan so that
such amount shall be held and administered pursuant to the terms of this Plan
and shall be received at the same time that benefits are received pursuant to
this Plan.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>4.1 <U>Short-Term Payout</U>. In connection with each election to defer an
Annual Deferral Amount, a Participant may elect to receive a future "Short-Term
Payout" from the Plan with respect to that Annual Deferral Amount. Subject to
the Deduction Limitation, the Short-Term Payout shall be a lump sum payment in
an amount that is equal to the Annual Deferral Amount plus amounts credited or
debited in the manner provided in Section 3.8 above on that amount, determined
at the time of the Short-Term Payout becomes payable. If the Annual Deferral
Amount is deferred in the 1999 Plan Year or an earlier Plan Year, each
Short-Term Payout elected shall be paid, subject to the Deduction Limitation,
within 60 days of the first day of the Plan Year that is at least four years
after the last day of the Plan Year in which the Annual Deferral Amount is
actually deferred, subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan. If the
Annual Deferral Amount is deferred after the 1999 Plan Year, each Short-Term
Payout elected shall be paid, subject to the Deduction Limitation, within 60
days of the first day of the Plan Year elected by the Participant that is two or
more years after the last day of the Plan Year in which the Annual Deferral
Amount is actually deferred, subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan.
By way of example, if a Short-Term Payout is elected for amounts that are
deferred in the Plan Year commencing January 1, 1997, the Short-Term Payout
becomes payable within 60 days after January 1, 2002; if a Short-Term Payout is
elected for amounts that are deferred in the Plan Year commencing January 1,
2000, the earliest that the Participant could elect to receive such Short-Term
Payout would be 60 days after January 1, 2003 (although the Participant would be
permitted to elect a greater number of years of deferral for the Short-Term
Payout).</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>4.2 <U>Other Benefits Take Precedence Over Short-Term Payout</U>. Should an
event occur that triggers a benefit under Articles 5, 6, 7 or 8 or Section
16.14, any Annual Deferral Amount, plus amounts credited or debited thereon,
that is subject to a Short-Term Payout election under Section 4.1 shall not be
paid in accordance with Section 4.1 but shall be paid in accordance with the
other applicable Article or Section.</P>
<P>4.3 <U>Withdrawal Payout/Suspensions for Unforeseeable Financial
Emergencies</U>. If the Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Financial
Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to (i) suspend any
deferrals required to be made by a Participant and/or (ii) receive a partial or
full payout from the Plan. The payout shall not exceed the lesser of the
Participant's Account Balance, calculated as if such Participant were receiving
a Termination Benefit, or the amount reasonably needed to satisfy the
Unforeseeable Financial Emergency. If, subject to the sole discretion of the
Committee, the petition for a suspension and/or payout is approved, suspension
shall take effect upon the date of approval and any payout shall be made within
60 days of the date of approval. The payment of any amount under this Section
4.3 shall not be subject to the Deduction Limitation.</P>
<P>4.4 <U>Withdrawal Election</U>. A Participant may elect, at any time, to
withdraw all of his or her Account Balance, less a withdrawal penalty equal to
7% of such amount (the net amount shall be referred to as the "Withdrawal
Amount"). This election can be made at any time, before or after Retirement,
Disability, death or Termination of Employment, and whether or not the
Participant (or Beneficiary) is in the process of being paid pursuant to an
installment payment schedule. If made before Retirement, Disability or death, a
Participant's Withdrawal Amount shall be his or her Account Balance calculated
as if there had occurred a Termination of Employment as of the day of the
election. No partial withdrawals of the Withdrawal Amount shall be allowed. The
Participant shall make this election by giving the Committee advance written
notice of the election in a form determined from time to time by the Committee.
The Participant shall be paid the Withdrawal Amount within 60 days of his or her
election. Once the Withdrawal Amount is paid, the Participant's participation in
the Plan shall terminate, the Participant's Unvested Accrued Amounts will be
forfeited and the Participant shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan
until the first month that begins more than one year after his or her
participation in the Plan terminated, at which time he or she will be eligible
to reenroll on terms similar to those applicable to a newly hired employee. The
payment of this Withdrawal Amount shall not be subject to the Deduction
Limitation.</P>

<P>5.2 <U>Payment of Retirement Benefit</U>. A Participant, in connection with
his or her commencement of participation in the Plan, shall elect on an Election
Form to receive the Retirement Benefit in a lump sum or pursuant to a Monthly
Installment Method of 60, 120 or 180 months. The Participant may annually change
his or her election to an allowable alternative payout period by submitting a
new Election Form to the Committee, provided that any such Election Form is
submitted at least one year prior to the Participant's Retirement and is
accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Election Form most
recently accepted by the Committee shall govern the payout of the Retirement
Benefit. If a Participant does not make any election with respect to the payment
of the Retirement Benefit, such benefit shall be payable in a lump sum. The lump
sum payment shall be made, or installment payments shall commence, no later than
60 days after the date the Participant Retires, subject to Section 10.3 (which
delays commencement of payment of the Retirement Benefit if the Participant
enters into a consulting arrangement with the Company following the
Participant's Retirement). Any payment made shall be subject to the Deduction
Limitation.</P>
<P>5.3 <U>Death Prior to Completion of Retirement Benefit</U>. If a Participant
dies after Retirement but before the Retirement Benefit is paid in full, the
Participant's unpaid Retirement Benefit payments shall continue and shall be
paid to the Participant's Beneficiary (a) over the remaining number of months
and in the same amounts as that benefit would have been paid to the Participant
had the Participant survived, or (b) in a lump sum, if requested by the
Beneficiary and allowed in the sole discretion of the Committee, that is equal
to the Participant's unpaid remaining Account Balance.</P>

Contributions and Vested Company Restoration Contributions) if a Participant
experiences a Termination of Employment prior to his or her Retirement, death or
Disability.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>7.2 <U>Payment of Termination Benefit</U>. The Termination Benefit shall be
paid in a lump sum within 60 days of the Termination of Employment, subject to
Section 10.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may elect either (i)
upon his election to participate in the Plan or (ii) at any time at least one
year prior to Termination of Employment to receive the Termination Benefit in
three, five, or ten annual installments. In such case, the Termination Benefit
shall be paid in the applicable number of installments, commencing no later than
60 days after the Participant's Termination of Employment, subject to Section
10.3 (which delays commencement of payment of the Termination Benefit if the
Participant enters into a consulting arrangement with the Company following the
Participant's Termination of Employment). Any payment made shall be subject to
the Deduction Limitation. The Participant may annually change his or her
election to an allowable alternative payout period by submitting a new Election
Form to the Committee, provided that any such Election Form is submitted at
least one year prior to the Participant's Termination of Employment and is
accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion. </P>

<P>(a) <U>Waiver of Deferral</U>. A Participant who is determined by the
Committee to be suffering from a Disability shall be excused from fulfilling
that portion of the Annual Deferral Amount commitment that would otherwise have
been withheld from a Participant's Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus for
the Plan Year during which the Participant first suffers a Disability. During
the period of Disability, the Participant shall not be allowed to make any
additional deferral elections, but will continue to be considered a Participant
for all other purposes of this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Disability is determined by the Committee to be expected to be of a short term
duration, the Annual Deferral Amount shall continue to be withheld from a
Participant's Base Annual Salary and/or Annual Bonus.</P>
<P>(b) <U>Return to Work</U>. If a Participant returns to employment with an
Employer, after a Disability ceases, the Participant may elect to defer an
Annual Deferral Amount for the Plan Year following his or her return to
employment or service and for every Plan Year thereafter while a Participant in
the Plan; provided such deferral elections are otherwise allowed and an Election
Form is delivered to and accepted by the Committee for each such election in
accordance with Section 3.3 above.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>8.2 <U>Continued Eligibility; Disability Benefit</U>. A Participant suffering
a Disability shall, for benefit purposes under this Plan, continue to be
considered to be employed, and shall be eligible for the benefits provided for
in Articles 4, 5, 6 or 7 in accordance with the provisions of those Articles.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee shall have the right to, in its sole
and absolute discretion and for purposes of this Plan only, and must in the case
of a Participant who is otherwise eligible to Retire if either clause (i) or
(ii) of this sentence applies, deem the Participant to have experienced a
Termination of Employment, or in the case of a Participant who is eligible to
Retire, to have Retired, at any time (or in the case of a Participant who is
eligible to Retire, as soon as practicable) after such Participant (i) is
determined to be permanently disabled under the Participant Employer's long-term
disability plan (or would have been determined to be permanently disabled had he
or she participated in that plan), or (ii), if such a plan does not exist, is
determined to be permanently disabled by the Committee in its sole discretion,
or (iii) is determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to have
suffered a partial disability of such a nature that the Participant is unable to
perform the material duties of his or her position. In such a case (whether
under clause (i), (ii) or (iii)), the Participant shall receive a Disability
Benefit equal to his or her Account Balance at the time the Committee's
determination. The Disability Benefit shall be paid in the same manner and at
the same time as specified in the election made by the Participant pursuant to
Section 5.2, unless the Committee in its sole discretion elects at any time to
pay such amount or any remaining amount in a lump sum payment. Any payment made
shall be subject to the Deduction Limitation. If a Participant is deemed to have
a Termination of Employment under this Section 8.2, a subsequent event that
would also constitute a Termination of Employment will be disregarded, and any
resumption of full duties shall result in reinstatement to participation under
the Plan only on such terms, as the Committee may then approve, that avoid
duplication of benefits hereunder.</P>

to designate his or her Beneficiary(ies) (both primary as well as contingent) to
receive any benefits payable under the Plan to a beneficiary upon the death of a
Participant. The Beneficiary designated under this Plan may be the same as or
different from the Beneficiary designation under any other plan of an Employer
in which the Participant participates.</P>
<P>9.2 <U>Beneficiary Designation; Change; Spousal Consent</U>. A Participant
shall designate his or her Beneficiary by completing and signing the Beneficiary
Designation Form, and returning it to the Committee or its designated agent. A
Participant shall have the right to change a Beneficiary by completing, signing
and otherwise complying with the terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and
the Committee's rules and procedures, as in effect from time to time. If the
Participant names someone other than his or her spouse as a Beneficiary for more
than 50% of the Participant's benefits, a spousal consent, in the form
designated by the Committee, must be signed by that Participant's spouse and
returned to the Committee (subject to any procedural requirements as may be
imposed by the Committee). Upon the acceptance by the Committee of a new
Beneficiary Designation Form, all Beneficiary designations previously filed
shall be cancelled. The Committee shall be entitled to rely on the last
Beneficiary Designation Form filed by the Participant and accepted by the
Committee prior to his or her death.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>9.3 <U>Acknowledgment</U>. No designation or change in designation of a
Beneficiary shall be effective until received, accepted and acknowledged in
writing by the Committee or its designated agent.</P>
<P>9.4 <U>No Beneficiary Designation</U>. If a Participant fails to designate a
Beneficiary as provided in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 above or, if all designated
Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to complete distribution
of the Participant's benefits, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary
shall be deemed to be his or her surviving spouse. If the Participant has no
surviving spouse, the benefits remaining under the Plan to be paid to a
Beneficiary shall be payable to the executor or personal representative of the
Participant's estate.</P>
<P>9.5 <U>Doubt as to Beneficiary</U>. If the Committee has any doubt as to the
proper Beneficiary to receive payments pursuant to this Plan, the Committee
shall have the right, exercisable in its discretion, to cause the Participant's
Employer to withhold such payments until this matter is resolved to the
Committee's satisfaction.</P>
<P>9.6 <U>Discharge of Obligations</U>. The payment of benefits under the Plan
to a Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge the Company, all Employers
and the Committee from all further obligations under this Plan with respect to
the Participant, and that Participant's Plan Agreement shall terminate upon such
full payment of benefits.</P>

<P>
<P align=center>Leave of Absence; Consulting</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>10.1 <U>Paid Leave of Absence</U>. If a Participant is authorized by the
Participant's Employer for any reason to take a paid leave of absence from the
employment of the Employer, the Participant shall continue to be considered
employed by the Employer and the Annual Deferral Amount shall continue to be
withheld during such paid leave of absence in accordance with Section 3.3.</P>
<P>10.2 <U>Unpaid Leave of Absence</U>. If a Participant is authorized by the
Participant's Employer for any reason to take an unpaid leave of absence from
the employment of the Employer, the Participant shall continue to be considered
employed by the Employer and the Participant shall be excused from making
deferrals until the earlier of the date the leave of absence expires or the
Participant returns to a paid employment status. Upon such expiration or return,
deferrals shall resume for the remaining portion of the Plan Year in which the
expiration or return occurs, based on the deferral election, if any, made for
that Plan Year. If no election was made for that Plan Year, no deferral shall be
withheld.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>10.3 <U>Consulting Arrangements</U>. Other provisions of the Plan
notwithstanding, if the Company enters into a consulting arrangement with a
Participant effective upon the Participant's Retirement or Termination of
Employment, the payment of the Retirement Benefit or Termination Benefit shall
be delayed. In this case, the Participant will be treated as though employment
continued until the consulting arrangement terminates for purposes of
determining the time at which payment of the Retirement Benefit or Termination
Benefit will commence. This provision will not limit the Participant's
withdrawal rights under Section 4.3 or 4.4 during the pendency of the consulting
arrangement, but the Participant will not be permitted to defer compensation
payable in connection with such consulting arrangement under the Plan. Any
determination of whether the Participant's severance from employment constitutes
a Retirement or Termination of Employment shall be determined based on his or
her circumstances at the time employment terminates, without regard to any
continued service pursuant to the consulting arrangement. </P>

<P align=center>ARTICLE 11</P>
<P>
<P align=center>Termination, Amendment or Modification</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>11.1 <U>Termination</U>. Each Employer reserves the right to terminate the
Plan at any time with respect to any or all of its Participants by the actions
of its board of directors. Upon the termination of the Plan with respect to any
Employer, the Plan Agreements of the affected Participants who are employed by
that Employer shall terminate and their Account Balance, determined as if they
had experienced a Termination of Employment on the date of Plan termination or,
if Plan termination occurs after the date upon which a Participant was eligible
to Retire, then with respect to that Participant as if he or she had Retired on
the date of Plan termination, shall be paid to the Participants as follows:
Prior to a Change in Control, if the Plan is terminated with respect to all of
its Participants, an Employer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and
notwithstanding any elections made by the Participant, to pay such benefits in a
lump sum promptly after termination or pursuant to a Monthly Installment Method
of up to 15 years, with amounts credited and debited during the installment
period as provided herein, except that, if the Plan is terminated with respect
to less than all of its Participants, an Employer shall be required to pay such
benefits in a lump sum promptly after termination. After a Change in Control,
the Employer shall be required to pay such benefits in a lump sum except that,
if a Participant has elected, upon his election to participate in the Plan or at
least one year prior to such termination of the Plan, to receive the benefits in
three, five, or ten annual installments under Section 7.2, the Employer shall
pay such benefits in the applicable number of annual installments commencing
promptly after such termination. The termination of the Plan shall not adversely
affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of
any benefits under the Plan prior to such termination; provided however, that
the Employer shall have the right to accelerate installment payments by paying
the Account Balance in a lump sum or pursuant to a Monthly Installment Method
using fewer months (except following a Change in Control in the case of
Participant who has elected under Section 7.2 to receive the benefits in a
three, five or ten annual installments).</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>11.2 <U>Amendment</U>. Any Employer may, at any time, amend or modify the
Plan in whole or in part with respect to that Employer by the actions of its
board of directors; provided, however, that no amendment or modification shall
be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a Participant's Account
Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made,
calculated as if the Participant had experienced a Termination of Employment as
of the effective date of the amendment or modification, or, if the amendment or
modification occurs after the date upon which the Participant was eligible to
Retire, the Participant had Retired as of the effective date of the amendment or
modification. The amendment or modification of the Plan shall not affect any
Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of benefits
under the Plan as of the date of the amendment or modification; provided,
however, that the Employer shall have the right to accelerate installment
payments by paying the Account Balance in a lump sum or pursuant to a Monthly
Installment Method using fewer months.</P>
<P>11.3 <U>Plan Agreement</U>. Despite the provisions of Sections 11.1 and 11.2
above, if a Participant's Plan Agreement contains benefits or limitations that
are not in this Plan document, the Employer may only amend or terminate such
provisions with the consent of the Participant.</P>
<P>11.4 <U>Effect of Payment</U>. The full payment of the applicable benefit
under Section 4.4 or Articles 5, 6, 7 or 8 of the Plan shall completely
discharge all obligations to a Participant and his or her designated
Beneficiaries under this Plan and the Participant's Plan Agreement shall
terminate.</P>

<P>
<P align=center>Claims Procedures</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>14.1 <U>Presentation of Claim</U>. Any Participant or Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant (such Participant or Beneficiary being referred to below as
a "Claimant") may deliver to the Committee a written claim for a determination
with respect to the amounts distributable to such Claimant from the Plan. If
such a claim relates to the contents of a notice received by the Claimant, the

<P>
<P align=center>Trust</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>15.1 <U>Establishment of the Trust</U>. The Company shall establish the
Trust, and each Employer shall at least annually transfer over to the Trust such
assets as the Employer determines are necessary to provide, on a present value
basis, for its future liabilities created with respect to all Annual Deferral
Amounts, Company Matching Amounts and Company Restoration Amounts for such
Employer's Participants for all periods prior to the transfer, as well as the
credits and debits to the Participants' Account Balance (and Unvested Accrued
Amounts) for all periods prior to the transfer, taking into consideration the
value of the assets in the trust at the time of the transfer.</P>
<P>15.2 <U>Interrelationship of the Plan and the Trust</U>. The provisions of
the Plan and the Plan Agreement shall govern the rights of a Participant to
receive distributions pursuant to the Plan. The provisions of the Trust shall
govern the rights of the Employers, Participants and the creditors of the

times remain liable to carry out its obligations under the Plan.</P>
<P>15.3 <U>Distributions From the Trust</U>. Each Employer's obligations under

<P align=center>ARTICLE 16</P>
<P>
<P align=center>Miscellaneous</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>16.1 <U>Unsecured General Creditor</U>. Participants and their Beneficiaries,
heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests
or claims in any property or assets of an Employer. For purposes of the payment
of benefits under this Plan, any and all of an Employer's assets shall be, and
remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Employer. An
Employer's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and
unsecured promise to pay money in the future. If any right of a Participant
under the Plan would cause such Participant to be in constructive receipt or
have the economic benefit of any funds or other assets such that the Participant
would be subject to federal income taxation in respect of such funds or other
assets prior to the Participant's actual receipt thereof as a Termination or
Retirement Benefit or other payout of benefits under the Plan, such right of the
Participant shall be restricted to the extent necessary so that the Participant
does not have such constructive receipt or economic benefit.</P>
<P>16.2 <U>Employer's Liability</U>. An Employer's liability for the payment of
benefits shall be defined only by the Plan and the Plan Agreement, as entered
into between the Employer and a Participant. An Employer shall have no
obligation to a Participant under the Plan except as expressly provided in the
Plan and his or her Plan Agreement.</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>16.3 <U>Nonassignability</U>. Neither a Participant nor any other person
shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate,
mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in
advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part
thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be,
unassignable and non-transferable, except that the foregoing shall not apply to
any family support obligations set forth in a court order. No part of the
amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure,
attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts,
judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other
person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's
or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.</P>
<P>16.4 <U>Not a Contract of Employment</U>. The terms and conditions of this
Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the
Company or any Employer and the Participant. Such employment is hereby
acknowledged to be an "at will" employment relationship that can be terminated
at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or
without notice, unless expressly provided in a written employment agreement.
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be
retained in the service of the Company or any Employer or to interfere with the
right of the Company or any Employer to discipline or discharge the Participant
at any time.</P>
<P>16.5 <U>Furnishing Information</U>. A Participant or his or her Beneficiary
will cooperate with the Committee by furnishing any and all information
requested by the Committee and take such other actions as may be requested in
order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and the payments of benefits
hereunder, including but not limited to taking such physical examinations as the
Committee may deem necessary.</P>
<P>16.6 <U>Terms</U>. Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they
shall be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where they
would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the
plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the
singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.</P>
<P>16.7 <U>Captions</U>. The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs
of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of any of its provisions.</P>
<P>16.8 <U>Governing Law</U>. Subject to ERISA, the provisions of this Plan
shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State
of Nevada without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.</P>
<P>16.9 <U>Notice</U>. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to
the Committee under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and
hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address
below:</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>Sierra Health Services Deferred </P>
<P>Compensation Plan Committee </P>
<P>P.O. Box 15645 </P>
<P>Las Vegas, Nevada 89114-5645</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery
is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for
registration or certification.</P>
<P>Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under
this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by mail,
to the last known address of the Participant.</P>
<P>16.10 <U>Successors</U>. The provisions of this Plan shall bind and inure to
the benefit of the Participant's Employer and its successors and assigns and the
Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiaries.</P>
<P>16.11 <U>Spouse's Interest</U>. The interest in the benefits hereunder of a
spouse of a Participant who has predeceased the Participant shall automatically
pass to the Participant and shall not be transferable by such spouse in any
manner, including but not limited to such spouse's will, nor shall such interest
pass under the laws of intestate succession.</P>
<P>16.12 <U>Validity</U>. In case any provision of this Plan shall be illegal or
invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidly shall not affect the
remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.</P>
<P>16.13 <U>Incompetent</U>. If the Committee determines in its discretion that
a benefit under this Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared
incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that
person's property, the Committee may direct payment of such benefit to the
guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such
minor, incompetent or incapable person. The Committee may require proof of
minority, incompetency, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate
prior to distribution of the benefit. Any payment of a benefit shall be a
payment for the account of the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, as
the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the
Plan for such payment amount.</P>
<P>16.14 <U>Court Order</U>. The Committee is authorized to make any payments
directed by court order in any action in which the Plan or the Committee has
been named as a party. In addition, if a court determines that a spouse or
former spouse of a Participant has an interest in the Plan as the result of a
property settlement or otherwise, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall
have the right, notwithstanding any election made by a Participant and
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.3, to take actions it deems
necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the order of the court. In such
case, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the following rules will
apply:</P></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(a) If the court's order directs immediate payment to or for the benefit of
the spouse or former spouse (or a dependent family member), the Participant's
Deferral Account or portion thereof subject to such order shall be valued as of
the date of the court order and paid out in accordance therewith as a lump sum
within 60 days thereafter. </P>
<P>(b) If the court's order directs payment to or for the benefit of the spouse
or former spouse (or a dependent family member) at a future date, the
Participant's Deferral Account shall be segregated, as of the date of the court
order, into two subaccounts, one representing the portion subject to the court's
order for payment to the spouse or former spouse (the "Court Order Subaccount")
and the other representing the portion that is not or will not thereafter be
required to be paid to such spouse or former spouse (the "Non-Court Order
Subaccount"). Both of these Subaccounts shall be maintained in the name of the
Participant. The Court Order Subaccount shall be reallocated, as of the date of
the court order, to the Measurement Fund that is a money market or other cash
equivalent fund, and shall remain in such Measurement Fund without reallocation
until such Subaccount is paid out. The Court Order Subaccount shall be paid, to
or for the benefit of the spouse or former spouse (or dependent family member)
or otherwise in accordance with the court order, at the earlier of the time
specified in the court order or the time that portion of the Deferral Account
otherwise would have been paid under the Plan; provided, however, that if an
event occurs that triggers a payout or benefit under Article 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8,
the Court Order Subaccount shall be paid in accordance with the such applicable
Article, and provided further, that the Court Order Subaccount shall remain
subject to any vesting and other restrictions under the Plan. The Non-Court
Order Subaccount shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan
without limitation.</P>
<P>(c) The Committee shall send written notice to the Participant explain the
actions and rights under this Section 16.14 with respect to the Participant's
Deferral Account, including (i) the reallocation of the Court Order Subaccount
to the money market or cash equivalent Measurement Fund, (ii) the federal income
tax consequence to the Participant upon payment of the Court Order Subaccount,
and (iii) any aspect of the court order with which the Company cannot
comply.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(a) <U>In General</U>. If, for any reason, all or any portion of a
Participant's benefit under this Plan becomes taxable to the Participant prior
to receipt, a Participant may petition the Committee before a Change in Control,
or the trustee of the Trust after a Change in Control, for a distribution of
that portion of his or her benefit that has become taxable. Upon the grant of
such a petition, which grant shall not be unreasonably withheld (and, after a
Change in Control, shall be granted), a Participant's Employer shall distribute
to the Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to the taxable
portion of his or her benefit (which amount shall not exceed a Participant's
Account Balance under the Plan). If the petition is granted, the tax liability
distribution shall be made within 90 days of the date when the Participant's
petition is granted. Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the benefits to
be paid under this Plan.</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>(b) <U>Trust</U>. If the Trust terminates in accordance with Section 3.7(e)
of the Trust and benefits are distributed from the Trust to a Participant in
accordance with that Section, the Participant's benefits under this Plan shall
be reduced to the extent of such distributions.</P></DIR></DIR>
<P>16.16 <U>Legal Fees To Enforce Rights After Change in Control</U>. The
Company and each Employer is aware that upon the occurrence of a Change in
Control, the Board or the board of directors of the Employer (which might then
be composed of new members) or a shareholder of the Company or the Employer, or
of any successor corporation might then cause or attempt to cause the Company,
the Employer or such successor to refuse to comply with its obligations under
the Plan and might cause or attempt to cause the Company or the Employer to
institute, or may institute, litigation seeking to deny Participants the
benefits intended under the Plan. In these circumstances, the purpose of the
Plan could be frustrated. Accordingly, if, following a Change in Control, it
should appear to any Participant that the Company, its Employer or any successor
corporation has failed to comply with any of its obligations under the Plan or
any agreement thereunder or, if the Company, such Employer or any other person
takes any action to declare the Plan void or unenforceable or institutes any
litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish or to recover from
any Participant the benefits intended to be provided, then the Company and the
Employer irrevocably authorize such Participant to retain counsel of his or her
choice at the expense of the Company and the Employer (who shall be jointly and
severally liable) to represent such Participant in connection with the
initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or
against the Company, the Employer or any director, officer, shareholder or other
person affiliated with the Company, the Employer or any successor thereto in any
jurisdiction.</P></DIR></DIR>
