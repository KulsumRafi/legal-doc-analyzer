was for Cause (as hereinafter defined) or (ii)&nbsp;if the Executive terminates
employment during the Term on his own volition, (other than after a breach of
this agreement by the Company), from, directly or indirectly, (a)&nbsp;engaging on
his own behalf in the Investigative and Intelligence Business (as hereinafter
defined), or (b)&nbsp;owning any interest in or engaging in or performing any
service for any person, firm, corporation or other entity, either as a partner,
owner, employee, consultant, agent officer, director or shareholder that (A)
derives a meaningful portion of its revenues from the Investigative and

business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Section&nbsp;4.2(d),
the term &#147;Term&#148; shall not include any month-to-month extensions of this

customer or any other person or concern dealing with or in any way associated
with the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate or to modify in any
other fashion to the detriment of the Company or any of its affiliates such
association with the Company or any of its affiliates. The Executive
represents that his experience and capabilities are such that the provisions of
this paragraph will not prevent him from earning a livelihood. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Section&nbsp;4.2(d), (i)&nbsp;it shall not be a violation of this
Section&nbsp;4.2(d) for the Executive to own two percent (2%) or less of a public
company, provided that the Executive does not exert or have the power to exert
any management or other control over such public company, and (ii)&nbsp;the
Executive shall not be required to sell or transfer the Executive&#146;s ownership
interest in any company involved in the Company&#146;s business which the Executive
owns as of the date of this Agreement. The &#147;Investigative and Intelligence
Business&#148; is defined as the business of private investigations, executive
