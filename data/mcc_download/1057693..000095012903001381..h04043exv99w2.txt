                                R E C I T A L S

           WHEREAS, NATCO's board of directors ("Board") has approved, and
considers it advisable and in the best interests of NATCO's shareholders to
consummate, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the
Ancillary Agreements ("Transactions"), on the terms and conditions in this
Agreement;

           NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

waiver of all the conditions to the Closing (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or on such other date and/or at
such other place as the Parties agree. The "Closing Date" is the date the
Closing occurs.

           (b) Transactions at the Closing: At the Closing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement:

           (i)        NATCO shall issue to Purchaser 15,000 Convertible

                                  ARTICLE II

                     NATCO'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  NATCO represents and warrants to Purchaser that:

           2.1 Organization and Authorization.

           (a) Power to Enter into the Agreement: Each of NATCO and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. NATCO has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and
each other document to be executed and delivered by it under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, and to consummate the Transactions to which it is a
party.

           (b) Authorization: All corporate action required on the part of
NATCO (including its directors and stockholders) to authorize NATCO's execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and each other
document to be executed and delivered by it under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, and NATCO's consummation of the Transactions to which it
is a party, has been taken (including

                                       2
<PAGE>
actions required under any rules of the New York Stock Exchange). NATCO has
given Purchaser evidence of such authorization.

           (c) Takeover Statutes: The Board and NATCO have taken any action
required on the part of NATCO so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or similar statute or regulation under state or federal laws
in the United States (including section 203 of the DGCL) applies to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
or the consummation of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, such
action shall include an approval for purposes of section 203 of the DGCL of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Transactions, the conversion
of the Convertible Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares and the exercise of
the Warrant into Warrant Shares.

           (d) Execution of the Agreement: NATCO has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement. NATCO has, or by the time of execution and delivery
by NATCO at or before the Closing will have, duly executed and delivered (or,
in the case of the Certificate of Designations, will have duly executed and
filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware) each Ancillary
Agreement and each other document to be executed and delivered by it under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

           (e) Agreement Binds NATCO: Assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the parties not affiliated with NATCO, this Agreement is (and each
Ancillary Agreement, and each other document purporting to impose an obligation
on NATCO to be executed and delivered by NATCO under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by NATCO, will be) a legally
valid and binding obligation of NATCO enforceable against NATCO in accordance
with its terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

           (f) Power to Do Business: Each of NATCO and its Subsidiaries has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each of NATCO and
its Subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation or other entity, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which it owns real property or in which the nature of the business it conducts
requires such qualification or licensing, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing does not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a NATCO Material Adverse Effect.

           2.2 Capitalization.

           (a) Authorized and Issued Capital: As of the Closing Date, NATCO's
authorized capital stock will consist of 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock and

                                       3
<PAGE>
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 500,000 is designated as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock and 15,000 will be designated as Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock. At the close of business on March 13, 2003:

           (i)        15,803,797 shares of Common Stock were issued and
                      outstanding; and

           (ii)       no Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and no
                      Convertible Preferred Shares had been issued.

All outstanding shares of capital stock of NATCO and its Subsidiaries are, and
all shares of capital stock of NATCO and its Subsidiaries which are issued
before the Closing will be, when issued and paid for in accordance with their
respective terms, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and not subject to preemptive rights.

           (b) No Other Securities or Rights: Other than (w) the shares of
Common Stock outstanding on March 13, 2003 as described in Section 2.2(a)(i),
(x) the shares of capital stock of NATCO's Subsidiaries owned by NATCO or one

Agreements to issue the Convertible Preferred Shares and the Warrant, and to
issue the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares on conversion of the
Convertible Preferred Shares or exercise of the Warrant, and (z) as disclosed
in Disclosure Schedule 2.2, there are not issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding:

           (i)        any shares of capital stock or voting securities of NATCO
                      or its Subsidiaries;

           (ii)       securities of NATCO or its Subsidiaries convertible into,
                      or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital
                      stock or voting securities of NATCO or its Subsidiaries;
                      or

           (iii)      warrants, options or other rights to buy from NATCO or
                      its Subsidiaries, or any obligation of NATCO or its
                      Subsidiaries to issue or cause to be issued, any shares
                      of capital stock, voting securities, or securities,
                      warrants, options or other rights convertible into, or
                      exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock
                      or voting securities of NATCO or its Subsidiaries.

           (c) No Repurchase Rights: Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, none of NATCO or its Subsidiaries is
obligated to repurchase, redeem or otherwise buy any securities or other rights
described in Section 2.2(b).

                                       4
<PAGE>
           (d) No Phantom Equity Rights: There are no outstanding phantom
equity, equity appreciation or similar rights enabling a Person to participate
in the residual equity value of, or appreciation in the equity value of, NATCO
or its Subsidiaries, or any agreements, commitments, understandings or other
arrangements relating to these.

           (e) No Arrangements Affecting Ownership: Except for the
Organizational Documents of NATCO and its Subsidiaries, to NATCO's Knowledge
there are no agreements or other arrangements establishing or affecting
ownership interests in NATCO or its Subsidiaries, or the rights and obligations
of the owners of those interests (including voting trusts or similar
arrangements).

           (f) Issuance of Convertible Preferred Shares: As of the Closing,
NATCO will have authorized 15,000 Convertible Preferred Shares. As of the
consummation of the Closing, the Convertible Preferred Shares then sold will be
duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding and, assuming Purchaser pays
for them, fully paid and nonassessable. The issuance of the Convertible
Preferred Shares is not subject to preemptive, subscription or similar rights
of any NATCO shareholder or any other Person. The Convertible Preferred Shares
will have the voting and other rights specified in the Certificate of
Designations, and all such rights shall be enforceable in accordance with their
terms.

           (g) Issuance of Conversion Shares: NATCO has authorized and reserved
for issuance solely on conversion of the Convertible Preferred Shares a number
of shares of Common Stock sufficient to permit the conversion in full of the
Convertible Preferred Shares into shares of Common Stock ("Conversion Shares").
On conversion of any Convertible Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares in
accordance with the Certificate of Designations, such Conversion Shares will be
validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and will have the
voting and other rights of Common Stock.

           (h) Issuance of Warrant Shares: NATCO has authorized and reserved
for issuance solely on exercise of the Warrant a number of shares of Common
Stock sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the Warrant for shares of
Common Stock ("Warrant Shares"). Assuming Purchaser pays the exercise price
(whether in cash or by way of a "cashless exercise"), on exercise of the
Warrant for Warrant Shares in accordance with the Warrant's terms, such Warrant
Shares will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable,
and will have the voting and other rights of Common Stock.

           2.3 Subsidiaries and Ownership Interests.

           (a) Subsidiaries: Disclosure Schedule 2.3 lists NATCO's Subsidiaries
and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization. NATCO
beneficially

                                       5
<PAGE>
owns, directly or indirectly, all the outstanding shares of capital stock (or
equivalent equity interests of entities other than corporations) of its
Subsidiaries.

           (b) Other Ownership Interests: Neither NATCO nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of, or
equity interest in, any Person (other than the Subsidiaries), or is obligated
to make a capital contribution to or other equity investment in such a Person.

           2.4 No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals.

           (a) Transactions Will Not Create Conflicts: Assuming that all of the
Consents and Permits listed in Disclosure Schedule 2.4 are obtained at or
before the Closing, neither NATCO's execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and each other document to be executed and delivered
by it under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, nor its consummation of
the Transactions, will:

           (i)        conflict with, or result in a breach of, NATCO's or any
                      of its Subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation, bylaws
                      or other organizational documents ("Organizational

                      increase in the amount of compensation or a benefit
                      payable under, a Material Contract or, to NATCO's
                      Knowledge, under any other Contract or other obligation
                      to which NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
                      by which any of them or any of their assets is bound;

           (iii)      conflict with, or result in a breach of, the Law; or

           (iv)       result in the termination, modification or nonrenewal of
                      a Permit.

           (b) No Third Party Approvals: Except for the Consents and Approvals
listed in Disclosure Schedule 2.4, no Consent of a Government Authority or
other Person required to be obtained by NATCO or Affiliates of NATCO is needed
in connection with NATCO executing, delivering and performing this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or any other document to be executed and delivered by
it under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or consummating any of the
Transactions.

all material respects with the terms of those Permits. To NATCO's Knowledge,
there is no basis on which a Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be
renewed in the ordinary course of business.

                      business for sums not yet due or being contested in good
                      faith and which do not constitute, individually or in the
                      aggregate, a NATCO Material Adverse Effect;

                      the lessee or sublessee under that lease to any such

<PAGE>
                      and in the aggregate, do not materially and adversely

                      Material Adverse Effect.

           2.10 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for (x) liabilities
specifically disclosed in the 2002 Balance Sheet or in the notes to the 2002
Balance Sheet (but only to the extent so disclosed) and (y) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2002 that do not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a NATCO Material Adverse Effect,
NATCO and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (whether known or
unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to
become due) that would have to be reflected or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet of NATCO prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied with the 2002 Balance Sheet (and notes to the 2002 Balance
Sheet).

           2.11 No Adverse Changes. Since December 31, 2002:

           (i)        no event, occurrence, fact, condition, change,
                      development or effect exists or has occurred or, to
                      NATCO's Knowledge, is threatened that, individually or in
                      the aggregate, constitutes a NATCO Material Adverse
                      Effect;

           (ii)       NATCO and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
                      operations only in the ordinary course consistent with
                      past practice; and

           (iii)      NATCO and its Subsidiaries have not taken, or omitted to
                      take, any action that, if that action or omission had
                      occurred after the date of this Agreement and before the
                      Closing, would breach Section 5.1 or Section 5.2.

           2.12 Material Contracts.

           (a) Material Contracts: Disclosure Schedule 2.12 lists the Contracts
that NATCO would have to disclose in an exhibit list to its Annual Report on
Form 10-K if that Annual Report were required to be filed on the date of this
Agreement ("Material Contracts"). NATCO has made available to Purchaser a copy
of each Material Contract.

           (b) No Breaches under Material Contracts: Each Material Contract is
in full force and effect and is enforceable against NATCO and, to NATCO's
Knowledge, the other parties to it in accordance with its terms (subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally

                                       9
<PAGE>
and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding in equity or at law). Neither NATCO nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to NATCO's Knowledge, any other Person, is in breach of, or
default under, a Material Contract and no event has occurred that, with notice
or passage of time or both, would constitute a breach of or default under a
Material Contract by NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries or, to NATCO's Knowledge,
any other Person (except for breaches and defaults that do not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a NATCO Material Adverse Effect). To NATCO's
Knowledge, no party to a Material Contract intends to terminate, or not renew,
a Material Contract.

           (c) Registration Rights Agreements: Disclosure Schedule 2.12 lists
each Contract NATCO has entered into under which a Person has the right to
request or to cause NATCO to effect registrations under the Securities Act of
securities issued by NATCO and the number of demand registration rights
outstanding under that Contract on the date of this Agreement. NATCO has given
Purchaser a copy of each such Contract.

           2.13 Employee Benefit Plans.

           (a) Plans: Each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(3)

bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, stock option or other equity based,
termination, change in control, retention, vacation, medical, dental, life,
disability or other welfare, profit-sharing, retirement, pension,
post-retirement benefits, or other compensation or benefit plan, agreement,
policy or arrangement in respect of which NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries has
material liability ("Plans") is listed in Disclosure Schedule 2.13(a). Except
as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule 2.13(a):

           (i)        none of the Plans nor any employee benefit plan
                      maintained by an ERISA Affiliate is subject to Title IV
                      of ERISA;

           (ii)       neither NATCO nor an ERISA Affiliate has, during the past
                      six years, maintained, contributed to, or had any
                      liability that, individually or in the aggregate, is
                      material with respect to, any employee benefit plan that
                      is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA;

           (iii)      no Plan nor any plan maintained by an ERISA Affiliate is
                      a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section
                      4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a "multiple employer plan" within
                      the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA; and

           (iv)       with respect to any of the Plans, neither NATCO nor its
                      Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur

                                      10
<PAGE>
                      any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, is
                      material under the funding, penalty, or excise tax
                      provisions of the Code relating to employee plans or
                      similar Laws of a foreign jurisdiction.

           (b) Plan Liabilities: Each Plan has been administered in material
compliance with its terms and the Law. Except as disclosed in Disclosure
Schedule 2.13(b) and based on reasonable actuarial assumptions, no Plan has
liabilities that exceed assets by more than $100,000, and Schedule 2.13(b)
discloses the amount of each such liability. To the extent that liabilities
under a Plan exceed the assets of that Plan, full reserves have been
established for that Plan in accordance with Law and the accounting rules of
the applicable jurisdiction, and those reserves are reflected on the 2002
Balance Sheet.

           (c) Effect of the Transactions: None of NATCO or its Subsidiaries
will, as a result of the Transactions (either alone or together with other
events), make or become obligated to make an "excess parachute payment" as
defined in section 280G of the Code or a payment that is not deductible under
section 162(m) of the Code. No current or former employee, director, agent,
independent contractor or officer of NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries is or
will become entitled to severance pay or unemployment compensation, additional
or new compensation, benefits or other compensatory payment, or an increase in
the amount of compensation, benefits or other compensatory payment, in
connection with or as a result of consummating the Transactions. Neither the
vesting nor the timing of the payment of any such compensation, benefit or
other compensatory payment in respect of any such employee, director or other
Person has been or will be accelerated in connection with or as a result of
consummating the Transactions.

           2.14 Labor Matters.

           (a) No Collective Bargaining Agreements: Except as disclosed in
Disclosure Schedule 2.14, neither NATCO nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by, and none of its employees is subject to, a collective
bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding or other written document or
arrangement relating to the terms and conditions of employment for a group of
employees organized for collective bargaining or other similar purposes. There
are no labor unions or other organizations representing, or, to NATCO's
Knowledge, purporting or attempting to represent, employees employed by NATCO
or its Subsidiaries.

           (b) No Strikes, etc.: Since January 1, 2001, there has not occurred
or been threatened a strike, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage, concerted
refusal to work overtime or other similar labor activity with respect to any
employees of NATCO or its Subsidiaries. There are no material labor or
employment disputes currently subject to a grievance procedure, arbitration or
litigation with respect to any employee of NATCO or its Subsidiaries.

                                      11
<PAGE>
           (c) Employment Laws: NATCO and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with the Law relating to the employment or termination of
employment of their employees (including those relating to labor relations,
equal employment opportunities, fair employment practices, prohibited
discrimination and other similar employment activities).

           2.15 Intellectual Property.

           (a) NATCO's Intellectual Property: NATCO and its Subsidiaries own
(beneficially and as of record), or possess valid and legally enforceable
licenses to use, the material Intellectual Property needed to conduct their
business and operations as currently conducted ("NATCO Intellectual Property").
NATCO has, in the ordinary course of business and in a timely manner, taken the
actions needed to fully protect the NATCO Intellectual Property. Without
limiting the generality of the previous sentence, the NATCO Intellectual
Property owned by NATCO has been registered with, filed in or issued by, or is
subject to a pending application for registration with, filing in or issuance
by, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and United States Copyright
Office or other domestic or foreign filing offices to the extent needed to
fully protect it under the Law. These registrations, filings and issuances are
in full force and effect.

           (b) No Infringement of NATCO's Rights: To NATCO's Knowledge, no
Person is infringing or allegedly infringing any NATCO Intellectual Property.

           (c) No Infringement of Third Party Rights: To NATCO's Knowledge, the
conduct of the business of NATCO and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
does not infringe or conflict with any Person's Intellectual Property. Neither
NATCO nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice, or to NATCO's
Knowledge unwritten notice, or otherwise has Knowledge of, any such
infringement or conflict.

           (d) No Claims: To NATCO's Knowledge, no Person has made or
threatened a claim or demand challenging the rights of NATCO or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of NATCO Intellectual Property or asserting that NATCO
or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise in conflict with
Intellectual Property. None of the NATCO Intellectual Property is or has been
the subject of Litigation within the last five years (whether or not resolved
in favor of NATCO or any Subsidiary).

           (e) No Loss of Rights: NATCO's execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and consummation of the Transactions, will not result in the loss
of, or the creation of a Lien on, the rights of NATCO or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any NATCO Intellectual Property.

           (a) Tax Returns: Each of NATCO, its Subsidiaries, and any
Consolidated Group has duly and timely filed all material Tax Returns that it
must file and has duly and timely paid all material Taxes shown on those Tax
Returns. Those Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects.

           (b) No Audits or Deficiencies: No audits or other administrative
proceedings or court proceedings are pending with regard to any Taxes or a Tax

Knowledge, none of NATCO or its Subsidiaries has received a notice of

           (i)        to NATCO's Knowledge, there is no liability for Taxes
                      (other than Taxes of NATCO and its Subsidiaries) for
                      which NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries would be held
                      liable solely by reason of section 1.1502-6 of the
                      Treasury Regulations or comparable provisions of any
                      other Tax law or as a successor or transferee; and

           (ii)       neither NATCO nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,

                      arrangement entered into with any Person (other than
                      NATCO and its Subsidiaries).

("Environmental Laws"). NATCO and its Subsidiaries are in possession of, and in
material compliance with, all Permits required under the Environmental Laws;

           (ii)       neither NATCO nor any of its Subsidiaries has caused or
                      taken any action that will result in, and neither NATCO

<PAGE>
                      nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to, any material
                      liability or obligation under any Environmental Law or
                      any liability or obligation for environmental
                      investigation, compliance, clean-up, removal, remediation
                      or damage (including with respect to the off-site
                      disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials);

           (iii)      no material work, repair, construction or capital
                      expenditure is required or planned by NATCO or any of its
                      Subsidiaries pursuant to or to comply with any
                      Environmental Law; and

           (iv)       NATCO has made available to Purchaser all environmental
                      information (including all site assessments, compliance
                      audits, notices of violation, allegations of
                      non-compliance, studies and test results) in NATCO's or
                      any of its Subsidiaries' possession, custody or control,
                      or otherwise known to NATCO or any of its Subsidiaries.

           (b) Environmental Litigation: There is no Litigation pending nor, to
NATCO's Knowledge, threatened that alleges a material violation by NATCO or its
Subsidiaries of any Environmental Law relating to their properties or other
assets, to the use or ownership of those properties or assets, or to their
businesses and operations.

           2.18 Litigation. Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule 2.18,
there is no Litigation pending, or to NATCO's Knowledge threatened, against
NATCO or its Subsidiaries, or any of their assets, that is either material or
related to asbestos. Neither NATCO nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to a
settlement or similar agreement with a Government Authority, or an order,
judgment, decree, injunction or award of a Government Authority.

insurance that are adequate to protect the business of NATCO and its
Subsidiaries and in amounts customarily carried by Persons conducting similar
business to NATCO and its Subsidiaries. These policies are in full force and
effect, and all premiums due on them have been paid. NATCO and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with those policies. To NATCO's
Knowledge, there is no reason to believe that an insurer would not renew any of
these policies on substantially the same terms and conditions, (except for
generally applicable market-based increases in premiums) or would not do so if
it knew of an event within NATCO's Knowledge but not known to the insurer.

representations and warranties in this Agreement, in the Ancillary Agreements
(not including the Rights Agreement Amendment) and in the documents referred to

respect to NATCO and its Subsidiaries.

obligation on Purchaser to be executed and delivered by Purchaser under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by Purchaser,
will be) a legally valid and binding obligation of Purchaser enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with its terms (subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

           3.2 No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals.

           (a) Transactions Will Not Create Conflicts: Neither Purchaser's
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and each
other document to be executed and delivered by it under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, nor its consummation of the Transactions, will:

           3.3 Litigation. There is no Litigation pending, or to Purchaser's
Knowledge threatened, against Purchaser which, individually or in the
aggregate, if determined adversely to Purchaser, would constitute a LR Material
Adverse Effect. Purchaser is not subject to a settlement or similar agreement
with a Government Authority, or an order, judgment, decree, injunction or award
of a Government Authority, that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes
a LR Material Adverse Effect.

           3.4 Brokers. No broker, finder, investment banker or other
intermediary is entitled to a brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in
connection with the Transactions, based on arrangements made by or on behalf of
Purchaser, that is or will be payable by NATCO or its Subsidiaries.

           3.5 Accredited Investor; Investment Purpose. Purchaser is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under
the Securities Act. Purchaser is buying the Convertible Preferred Shares, the
Warrant, the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares for its own account and
solely for investment, with no intention to resell or distribute those
securities in breach of the Securities Act.

           3.6 Restrictions on Transfer. Purchaser understands that the
Convertible Preferred Shares, the Conversion Shares, the Warrant and the
Warrant Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act (or the
securities laws of any state) and that they may only be sold or otherwise
disposed of in one or more transactions registered under the Securities Act
(and, where applicable, such state laws) or as to which an exemption from the
registration requirements is available.

           3.7 No Ownership of Stock. Lime Rock Partners II, L.P. does not
beneficially own (as determined under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act or
section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement) any capital stock of NATCO, nor is it
party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any capital stock of NATCO or any
security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, capital stock of
NATCO (except this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements).

              PURCHASER'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS SECURITYHOLDER

           4.1 Transfer of Securities; Legends.

           (a) Transfers Before the First Anniversary: Before the first
anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly offer,
sell, assign, transfer, grant a participation interest in, pledge, encumber or
otherwise dispose of (including any disposition of voting or investment control
over), or place in trust (voting or otherwise)

                                      17
<PAGE>
("Transfer") any Convertible Preferred Shares or the Warrant (or any interest
in the Warrant) without NATCO's prior written consent.

           (b) Transfers On or After the First Anniversary: On and after the
first anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly
Transfer any Convertible Preferred Shares or the Warrant (or any interest in
the Warrant) without NATCO's prior written consent. NATCO shall not
unreasonably withhold its consent if Purchaser proposes to Transfer Convertible
Preferred Shares or the Warrant (or an interest in the Warrant) to an
Institutional Investor.

           (c) Transfer of Right to Elect a Director: Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly
Transfer the right to vote in the election or appointment of a director under
section 4(c) of the Certificate of Designations without NATCO's prior written
consent. NATCO shall not unreasonably withhold its consent if Purchaser
proposes to Transfer Convertible Preferred Shares to an Institutional Investor.
Before Transferring Convertible Preferred Shares to any Person in respect of
whom NATCO has not granted such consent, Purchaser shall agree to such changes
in the Certificate of Designations or to such grant or retention of proxies as
shall be reasonably requested by NATCO to ensure that the Transferee does not
have the right to vote in electing or appointing a director under section 4(c)
of the Certificate of Designations.

           (d) Exceptions: Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(b) and Section 4.1(c)
shall not apply to any Transfer:

           (i)        consisting of a conversion under section 8 or section 11
                      of the Certificate of Designations;

           (ii)       to NATCO on a redemption under section 10 of the
                      Certificate of Designations;

           (iii)      to NATCO on Purchaser's exercise of any of its rights
                      under section 11 of the Certificate of Designations; or

           (iv)       to Purchaser's general and limited partners on
                      Purchaser's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or
                      otherwise in a distribution to those partners, if in each
                      case those partners agree in writing to be bound by
                      Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement and the
                      Ancillary Agreements.

           (e) Warrant Transferred with Convertible Preferred Shares: Purchaser
may only Transfer Convertible Preferred Shares or the Warrant (or an interest
in the Warrant) if, at the same time, it Transfers to the Transferee an
interest in the Warrant or Convertible Preferred Shares, as the case may be,
such that, after the Transfer, the ratio of

                                      18
<PAGE>
the number of Purchaser's Convertible Preferred Shares to the number of Warrant
Shares for which the interest in the Warrant held by Purchaser is exercisable
is the same as such ratio immediately before the Transfer.

           (f) Attempted Transfers. Attempts to Transfer Convertible Preferred
Shares or the Warrant (or any interest in the Warrant) in breach of this
Section 4.1 shall be void ab initio, and neither NATCO nor any transfer agent
shall give effect in NATCO's stock records to such attempted Transfers.

           (g) Legends:

           (i)        Each certificate representing Convertible Preferred
                      Shares, Conversion Shares or Warrant Shares and each
                      Warrant (except those which have been transferred in a
                      transaction registered under the Securities Act or exempt
                      from the registration requirements of the Securities Act)
                      shall bear the following legend:

                                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
                                  [CERTIFICATE] [WARRANT] HAVE NOT BEEN
                                  REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
                                  OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY
                                  NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT
                                  PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
                                  STATEMENT UNDER THAT ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE
                                  SECURITIES LAWS OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION TO
                                  THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THAT ACT AND
                                  THOSE LAWS."

           (ii)       In addition, each certificate representing Convertible
                      Preferred Shares and each Warrant shall bear the
                      following legend:

                                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
                                  [CERTIFICATE][WARRANT] ARE SUBJECT TO
                                  RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND CAN BE
                                  TRANSFERRED ONLY PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF A
                                  SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
                                  MARCH 13, 2003 AMONG THE COMPANY AND LIME
                                  ROCK PARTNERS II, L.P."

           (h) Unlegended Securities: At Purchaser's request, NATCO will
exchange certificates or the Warrant with the legend in Section 4.1(g)(i) for
certificates or a Warrant without this legend at any time after:

                                      19
<PAGE>
           (i)        the securities represented by those certificates or
                      Warrant have been sold to the public under an effective
                      registration statement under the Securities Act or Rule
                      144;

           (ii)       the issuance is otherwise permitted under the Securities
                      Act, the holder of those securities has given NATCO an
                      opinion of counsel to this effect and that holder
                      requests such a certificate or Warrant from NATCO; or

           (iii)      those securities represented by that certificate or the
                      Warrant have been beneficially owned by a Person for a
                      period of at least two years (or such shorter period
                      applying under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or
                      any successor to it), and as of the date of determination
                      of that two year period, that Person has not been an
                      affiliate of NATCO for at least three months, all as
                      determined under Rule 144.

           4.2 Directors Appointed by Purchaser.

           (a) Clayton Act: Purchaser shall not elect or appoint any person to
the Board under the Certificate of Designations if that person's inclusion on
the Board would violate section 8 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.ss.19.

           (b) Directors' Rights and Benefits: NATCO shall ensure that, once
elected or appointed to the Board, directors elected or appointed by Purchaser
under the Certificate of Designations receive the rights and benefits granted
to the other non-management NATCO directors, on terms at least as favorable as
those applying to such other NATCO directors (including rights to fees,
reimbursement of expenses, indemnification and grants of stock and options).

           4.3 Board Observer and Information.

           (a) Right to Appoint Board Observer and to Consult Management: If
the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares are no longer entitled to elect or
appoint a director under section 4(c) of the Certificate of Designations then,
for so long as Purchaser owns Convertible Preferred Shares and shares of Common
Stock that together represent 50% or more of the number of shares of Common
Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date
were convertible (as adjusted to reflect any stock split, combination,
reclassification or similar event) and no merger, consolidation or
recapitalization constituting a Change of Control has occurred, then Purchaser
is entitled to:

           (i)        appoint an observer to the Board (and to remove this
                      person, and to appoint another person in his or her place
                      from time to time); and

                                      20
<PAGE>
           (ii)       discuss NATCO's and its Subsidiaries' significant affairs
                      with, and to make proposals and give advice with respect
                      to these matters to, NATCO's principal officers to the
                      same extent that NATCO's non-management directors may do
                      so.

Each observer appointed by Purchaser shall enter into a confidentiality
agreement with NATCO on customary terms.

           (b) Board Observer: NATCO will ensure that the observer that
Purchaser appoints to the Board under Section 4.3(a):

           (i)        receives notice of, and has the right to attend, Board
                      meetings;

           (ii)       receives materials distributed to members of the Board in
                      connection with Board meetings;

           (iii)      does not count in determining whether there is a quorum
                      present at a Board meeting; and

           (iv)       is not entitled to vote on matters voted on by the Board.

           (c) Rights Personal to Purchaser: Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser may not assign any of its rights under
this Section 4.3, and any such assignment shall be void ab initio.

           4.4 Bylaws. NATCO shall take, or cause to be taken, all lawful
action needed to ensure that its bylaws do not conflict with this Agreement and
the Transactions.

           4.5 Remedies for Default in Paying Dividends on Convertible
Preferred Shares. While the Domestic Loan Agreement remains in effect, the sole
remedies of the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares by reason of the
commencement of the Default Period (as defined in the Certificate of
Designations) are the increase of the dividend rate under section 3(a) and
section 3(e) of the Certificate of Designations, the right to elect or appoint
a direction under section 4(d) of the Certificate of Designations and the
restrictions in section 3(d) and section 5 of the Certificate of Designations.

                      and its Subsidiaries that Purchaser from time to time
                      reasonably requests (and copies of any of these documents
                      or this information that Purchaser requests);

                                      23
<PAGE>
           (ii)       give Purchaser copies of the press releases and public
                      filings made by NATCO and its Subsidiaries after the date
                      of this Agreement; and

           (iii)      use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Purchaser
                      generally informed about the business of NATCO and its
                      Subsidiaries.

           5.4 Reservation of Common Stock for Conversion and Exercise.

           (a) NATCO shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance on the
conversion of the Convertible Preferred Shares and exercise of the Warrant, the
number of Conversion Shares issuable on conversion of the outstanding
Convertible Preferred Shares not previously converted and the number of Warrant
Shares for which the Warrant may still be exercised.

           (b) On any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock into
which the Convertible Preferred Shares are convertible, NATCO shall take such
steps as may be necessary to authorize, and shall reserve, a sufficient number
of additional shares of Common Stock solely to permit the conversion in full of
the Convertible Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares. On conversion of any
Convertible Preferred Shares into Conversion Shares in accordance with the
Certificate of Designations, such Conversion Shares will be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and will have the voting and other
rights of Common Stock.

           (c) On any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock for
which the Warrant is exercisable, NATCO shall take such steps as may be
necessary to authorize, and shall reserve, a sufficient number of additional
shares of Common Stock solely to permit the exercise in full of the Warrant
into Warrant Shares. Assuming Purchaser pays the exercise price (whether in
cash or by way of a "cashless exercise"), on exercise of the Warrant for
Warrant Shares in accordance with the Warrant's terms, such Warrant Shares will
be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and will have
the voting and other rights of Common Stock.

           5.5 Listing. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, NATCO shall
file a supplemental listing application for the issuance of the Conversion
Shares and the Warrant Shares, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the New York Stock Exchange's written confirmation that it has approved
the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares for listing (subject to official
notice of issuance).

           5.6 Constructive Distributions.

           (a) Subject to later determinations under the Law, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that it is their present intent to treat the Convertible
Preferred Shares as not

                                      24
<PAGE>
giving rise to constructive distributions under section 305(c) of the Code by
reason of Treasury Regulation section 1.305-5(b) as a result of any difference
between the issue price and redemption price of the Convertible Preferred
Shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if any such constructive
distributions are found to exist by any taxing authority, Purchaser shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless NATCO from and against, and pay or
reimburse NATCO for, any withholding taxes imposed as a result of NATCO's
failure to withhold with respect to such constructive distribution (including
any interest and penalties on such withholding tax). NATCO will give Purchaser
the opportunity to contest any such finding by any taxing authority and will
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in that connection. So long as the
Convertible Preferred Shares are outstanding, any indemnity for such
withholding taxes shall be funded in the manner contemplated by the last
sentence in Section 5.6(d) (or, to the extent necessary, as provided in Section
5.6(e)).

           (b) If either Party subsequently determines in good faith that it is
required under the Law (x) to treat the Convertible Preferred Shares as giving
rise to constructive distributions under section 305(c) of the Code or (y) to
treat any amounts paid to Purchaser in respect of the Convertible Preferred
Shares as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or withhold any
amounts from the amounts paid to Purchaser in respect of the Convertible
Preferred Shares) other than cash dividends that are declared by the Board and
paid as provided in section 3(a) of the Certificate of Designations, then such
Party shall notify the other Party of that determination promptly after making
that determination.

           (c) NATCO will withhold from each payment to Purchaser any amount
required by Law unless NATCO is not required to withhold as a result of
Purchaser providing the appropriate IRS Form (e.g., W-8, W-8IMY or W-9) duly
executed and accompanied by any required supporting documentation. However,
NATCO will not withhold with respect to any action or event that could result
in a constructive distribution under section 305(c) of the Code by reason of
Treasury Regulation section 1.305-5(b) to the extent that Purchaser provides
NATCO with an opinion reasonably satisfactory to NATCO from nationally
recognized tax counsel that withholding is not required with respect to such
action or event or that there is no constructive distribution.

           (d) If NATCO withholds with respect to any constructive distribution
under section 305(c) of the Code, NATCO shall fund the amount of such required
withholding in cash and timely pay such amount to the appropriate taxing
authority. With respect to withholding required with respect to any
constructive distribution under section 305(c) of the Code that is reflected in
or increases the Face Value (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of
or accrued dividends on the Convertible Preferred Shares, at the election of
NATCO, (x) either the Face Value or the amount of any accrued dividends with
respect to the Convertible Preferred Shares (to the extent so reflected or
increased), or (y) future cash distributions to Purchaser, shall be reduced by
the amount of such

                                      25
<PAGE>
withholding, and the Parties shall treat the amount withheld as if it had
actually been distributed with respect to the Convertible Preferred Shares.
However, in lieu of reducing the Face Value or accrued dividends, Purchaser may
elect by providing notice to NATCO to pay the amount of such withholding in
cash within 90 days from the date that such withholding was required to be paid
to the relevant taxing authority (together with interest at 10% per annum from
such date to the date of payment by Purchaser). With respect to withholding
required with respect to any other constructive distribution, NATCO shall be
permitted to reduce future cash distributions to Purchaser by the amount of
such withholding.

           (e) If the Convertible Preferred Shares are converted into Common
Stock before NATCO has recovered the full amount owed to NATCO as a result of
its payment to the taxing authority under this Section 5.6, then the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable to Purchaser on conversion shall be reduced
by a number of shares of Common Stock having a value (valued at the Current Per
Share Market Price as defined in the Certificate of Designations) equal to the
unpaid balance.

           5.7 Number of Convertible Preferred Shares Redeemed.

           (a) If NATCO requests a redemption of any Convertible Preferred
Shares under section 10 of the Certificate of Designations, at the written
request of Purchaser, NATCO will, in connection with each such redemption,
redeem no fewer than the number of shares certified to by Purchaser as being
the minimum amount necessary to cause the redemption to qualify as
"substantially disproportionate" within the meaning of section 302(b)(2) of the
Code (and Purchaser shall provide such documentation as is reasonably
satisfactory to NATCO to support Purchaser's determination of such minimum
amount).

           (b) If, in the case of any such redemption, Purchaser determines
that a redemption of all the Convertible Preferred Shares would not so qualify
(and Purchaser provides such documentation as is reasonably satisfactory to
NATCO to support Purchaser's determination), NATCO will repurchase from
Purchaser (at a price equal to the excess of the value of the underlying shares
of Common Stock (valued at the Current Per Share Market Price as defined in the
Certificate of Designations) over the exercise price) that part of the Warrant
representing the right to buy that number of shares certified to by Purchaser
as being the minimum amount necessary to cause the redemption to qualify as
"substantially disproportionate" within the meaning of section 302(b)(2) of the
Code.

           (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.7(a) and Section 5.7(b), NATCO may
redeem a number of Convertible Preferred Shares or repurchase part of the
Warrant representing the right to buy a number of Warrant Shares, as the case
may be, less than the amount certified to by Purchaser if NATCO provides an
opinion from nationally recognized tax

                                      26
<PAGE>
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that a redemption of the lesser
amount will result in exchange treatment for Purchaser under section 302(b) of
the Code.

           (d) If any proposed redemption of Convertible Preferred Shares by
NATCO cannot be made to qualify as "substantially disproportionate" within the
meaning of section 302(b) of the Code as described in this Section 5.7, or
NATCO does not deliver the opinion of counsel described in Section 5.7(c) with
respect to such proposed redemption, such redemption shall not be made without
Purchaser's consent.

                                  ARTICLE VI

                        COVENANTS OF NATCO AND PURCHASER

           6.1 Public Announcements.

           (a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, NATCO shall
distribute to the press a press release, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Purchaser, announcing the general terms of the Transactions.

           (b) Except as required by Section 6.1(a), before the Closing, except
as required by the Law, neither Party shall (and shall ensure that its
Affiliates, stockholders, partners and Representatives do not) make a public
announcement or public disclosure in respect of this Agreement or the
Transactions without the other Party's prior consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld). If a Party is required by Law to make such a public announcement or
public disclosure, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with
the other Party on the announcement or disclosure before it is made.

           6.2 Further Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to do the
things needed or appropriate to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
possible, including:

           (i)        filing or supplying the applications, notifications and
                      information that it must file or supply under the Law,
                      and give reasonable undertakings in connection with
                      these;

           (ii)       obtaining the Consents needed or appropriate to
                      consummate the Transactions; and

           (iii)      coordinating and cooperating with the other Party in
                      exchanging the information and supplying the reasonable
                      assistance reasonably requested by the other Party.


                                      27
<PAGE>
           6.3 Notification of Certain Matters. Through the Closing:

           (i)        each Party ("Notifying Party") shall give prompt notice
                      to the other Party of:

                      (A)        the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event
                                 which would cause a representation or warranty
                                 of the Notifying Party in this Agreement to be
                                 inaccurate in a material respect at a Closing
                                 Date, or a condition in ARTICLE VII not to be
                                 satisfied;

                      (B)        a material failure of the Notifying Party to
                                 perform an obligation that it must perform
                                 under this Agreement; and

           (ii)       NATCO shall give prompt notice to Purchaser of matters
                      that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
                      NATCO Material Adverse Effect or breaches of Section 5.1
                      or Section 5.2; and

           (iii)      Purchaser shall give prompt notice to NATCO of matters
                      that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a LR
                      Material Adverse Effect.

           6.4 Supplemental Disclosure. NATCO has the right, from time to time,
at any time at least two Business Days before the Closing, to give Purchaser
supplements to the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter that arises
after the date of this Agreement and that would have been required or permitted
to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules had the matter existed as of the
date of this Agreement. This supplemental disclosure will be disregarded in
determining whether the conditions to the Closing have been satisfied as of the
Closing Date, but will be given effect for the purposes of determining whether
NATCO has breached its representations and warranties for the purposes of
ARTICLE IX.

           6.5 Confidentiality.

           (a) General Confidentiality Obligation: If the Closing occurs, and
subject to Section 6.5(b), Section 6.5(c) and Section 6.5(d), each of Purchaser
and NATCO agrees that it will, and will cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives to:

           (i)        keep confidential the information, documents and
                      instruments delivered to it by the other Party and the
                      other Party's Affiliates and Representatives, whether
                      before, on or after the date of this Agreement, in
                      connection with negotiating, preparing, executing and
                      delivering this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
                      and performing the Parties' obligations under this
                      Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; and

                                      28
<PAGE>
           (ii)       only disclose such information, documents and instruments
                      to those of its Affiliates and Representatives that have
                      a need to know such information, documents and
                      instruments and have been informed of their confidential
                      nature.

           (b) General Exceptions: Section 6.5(a) does not apply to any
information, document or instrument that:

           (i)        is already in the receiving Party's possession when it
                      receives it from the disclosing Party, or becomes
                      available to the receiving Party from a source other than
                      the disclosing Party (provided that it was lawfully
                      obtained and is not known by the receiving Party to be
                      subject to another confidentiality agreement with, or
                      other obligation of secrecy to, the disclosing Party or
                      another Person); or

           (ii)       becomes generally available to the public other than
                      directly or indirectly as a result of a disclosure by the
                      receiving Party or any of the receiving Party's
                      Affiliates or Representatives.

           (c) Disclosure Required by Law: If a Party is requested or is
required by Law (including by way of interrogatories, requests for information
or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose information, documents and instruments required to be kept
confidential under Section 6.5(a), it shall to the extent permitted by Law give
the other Party prompt notice of this request or requirement so that the other
Party may consider seeking a protective order. If, in the absence of a
protective order, the Party requested or required to disclose is, in the
opinion of its independent counsel, compelled to disclose such information,
documents or instruments to a tribunal or to any other Person or else be in
breach of the Law, stand liable for contempt or suffer other material censure
or penalty, that Party may disclose such information, documents or instruments
to the tribunal or other Person.

           (d) Disclosure under Treasury Regulations: Each Party authorizes the
other to disclose the information, documents and instruments regarding the
structure and tax aspects of the Transactions to the extent required by section
6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations under the Code in order to avoid
the Transactions being treated as a "Confidential Transaction" as defined by
the Treasury Regulations.

6.6 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each Party shall sign and
deliver the additional documents and take the other actions needed, or
otherwise reasonably requested by the other Party, to confirm and assure the
rights and obligations in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to
make the consummation of the Transactions effective.

                               CLOSING CONDITIONS

           7.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligations. Each Party's obligation
to consummate the Transactions to be consummated at the Closing is subject to
the fulfillment, on or before the Closing Date, of the following conditions
(any or all of which may be waived, in whole or in part, in writing to the
extent permitted by Law):

           (i)        No Injunction, etc.: Consummation of the Transactions has
                      not been restrained, enjoined or otherwise prohibited or
                      made illegal by the Law. No Government Authority has
                      enacted a Law making the consummation of the Transactions
                      illegal, and no proceeding with respect to the
                      application of such a Law is pending.

           (ii)       Consents: All Consents of Government Authorities and
                      other third parties needed to consummate the Transactions
                      (including all Consents listed in Disclosure Schedule
                      2.4) have been obtained and are in full force and effect.

           (iii)      Listing Approval: The New York Stock Exchange has given
                      NATCO written confirmation that it has approved the
                      Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares for listing,
                      subject to official notice of issuance.

           (iv)       Registration Rights Agreement: The Parties have entered
                      into a registration rights agreement in form and
                      substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties which
                      remains in full force and effect ("Registration Rights
                      Agreement").

           (v)        Rights Agreement Amendment: NATCO and ChaseMellon
                      Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as rights agent, have
                      entered into an amendment to the Rights Agreement, dated
                      as of May 15, 1998, ("Rights Agreement Amendment") in
                      form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties
                      which, among other things, permits Purchaser to be the
                      beneficial owner (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of
                      20% of the shares of Common Stock without being an
                      "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement)
                      and which remains in full force and effect, and NATCO has
                      given Purchaser a copy of the executed Rights Agreement
                      Amendment.

<PAGE>
           7.2 Conditions to Purchaser's Obligations. Purchaser's obligation to
consummate the Transactions to be consummated at the Closing is subject to the
fulfillment (or waiver by Purchaser), on or before the Closing Date, of the
following additional conditions, which NATCO agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be fulfilled:

           (i)        NATCO's Representations and Warranties: NATCO's
                      representations and warranties in this Agreement and in
                      the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party are true
                      and correct in all respects (in the case of
                      representations and warranties with a materiality
                      qualification) or in all material respects (in the case
                      of other representation and warranties) as of the date of
                      this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same
                      effect in each case as though made on and as of the
                      Closing Date (except in each case for representations and
                      warranties expressly relating only to an earlier date,
                      which are instead so measured on and as of such earlier
                      date).

           (ii)       NATCO's Obligations: NATCO has performed in all material
                      respects the obligations under this Agreement that it
                      must perform before the Closing.

           (iii)      Form 10-K: NATCO has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K
                      for the 2002 fiscal year which contains an audited
                      balance sheet for NATCO and its Subsidiaries as of
                      December 31, 2002 and audited consolidated statements of
                      income and cash flow for the twelve months ended December
                      31, 2002, and notes to those statements, that are, in all
                      material respects, the same as those given to Purchaser
                      under Section 2.8(b). That Annual Report on Form 10-K
                      contains all certifications of officers required under
                      the Law which have been made by each person occupying the
                      office of chief executive officer or chief financial
                      officer during the 2002 fiscal year.

           (iv)       Board of Directors: The Board includes a director
                      nominated or designated by Purchaser.

           (v)        Certificate of Designations: The Certificate of
                      Designations is in full force and effect and has been
                      filed with the Secretary of State for the State of

           (viii)     Other Parties: Since the date of this Agreement, no
                      Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) has
                      disclosed in a Schedule 13D or similar document filed
                      with the SEC that it has acquired beneficial ownership of
                      more than 15% of NATCO's outstanding voting securities
                      nor, to NATCO's Knowledge, has any such Person or "group"
                      acquired beneficial ownership of more than 15% of NATCO's
                      outstanding voting securities. Since the date of this
                      Agreement, no Person has entered into an agreement or
                      arrangement with NATCO (whether or not legally binding)
                      with respect to a tender or exchange offer for any shares
                      of Common Stock or a merger, consolidation or other
                      business combination involving NATCO or any of its
                      Subsidiaries or has commenced or announced an intention
                      to commence a tender or exchange offer for any shares of
                      Common Stock.

           (ix)       Officer's Certificate: An officer or officers of NATCO
                      have executed and delivered to Purchaser a certificate or
                      certificates certifying the matters in Section 7.2(i),
                      Section 7.2(ii), Section 7.2(iv) and Section 7.2(viii).

           (x)        No NATCO Material Adverse Effect: Since the date of this
                      Agreement, no event, occurrence, fact, condition, change,
                      development or effect has occurred that constitutes a
                      NATCO Material Adverse Effect (but, solely for the
                      purpose of this Section 7.2(x), disregarding the
                      exceptions in the definition of NATCO Material Adverse
                      Effect that refer to a state of facts, event, change or
                      effect generally applying to the United States economy or
                      securities, financial or capital markets).

           7.3 Conditions to NATCO's Obligations. NATCO's obligation to
consummate the Transactions to be consummated at the Closing is subject to the
fulfillment (or waiver by NATCO), on or before the Closing Date, of the
following additional conditions, which Purchaser agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be fulfilled:

<PAGE>
           (i)        Purchaser's Representations and Warranties: Purchaser's
                      representations and warranties in this Agreement and in
                      the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party are true
                      and correct in all respects (in the case of
                      representations and warranties with a materiality
                      qualification) or in all material respects (in the case
                      of other representations and warranties) as of the date
                      of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the
                      same effect in each case as though made on and as of the
                      Closing Date (except in each case for representations and
                      warranties expressly relating only to an earlier date,
                      which are instead so measured on and as of such earlier
                      date).

           (ii)       Purchaser's Obligations: Purchaser has performed in all
                      material respects the obligations under this Agreement
                      that it must perform before the Closing.

           (iii)      Officer's Certificate: An officer or officers of
                      Purchaser have executed and delivered to NATCO a
                      certificate or certificates certifying the matters in
                      Section 7.3(i) and Section 7.3(ii).

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                  TERMINATION

           8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated before the Closing
Date:

           (i)        Mutual Agreement: by the written agreement of the
                      Parties;

           (ii)       Lapse of Time: by either Party giving notice to the other
                      Party after May 13, 2003 if the Closing has not occurred
                      by then (unless due to a material breach of this
                      Agreement by the Party giving notice); or

           (iii)      Material Breach: by either Party giving notice to the
                      other Party if the other Party has materially breached
                      any of its representations, warranties or obligations
                      under this Agreement and (if not a willful breach) has
                      not cured this breach within 15 Business Days of
                      receiving notice of the breach from the Party seeking to
                      terminate, and the Party giving notice to terminate is
                      not itself in material breach of its representations,
                      warranties or obligations under this Agreement.

                                      33

           8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement terminates under
Section 8.1, this Agreement will be void and have no effect, without any
liability to any Person in respect of this Agreement or of the Transactions on
the part of a Party, or its Affiliates, stockholders, partners or
Representatives, except for ARTICLE X and except for any liability resulting
from the Party's breach of this Agreement before this Agreement terminated.
However, except in the case of fraud or a willful breach of covenant, a Party's
liability if this Agreement terminates under Section 8.1 is limited to the
amount of the other Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement before the termination or incurred in connection
with the termination of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                                INDEMNIFICATION

           9.1 Indemnification by NATCO. From and after the Closing Date, NATCO
shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and
partners, and all such Persons' Representatives ("LR Indemnitees") from and
against, and pay or reimburse the LR Indemnitees for, any liabilities,
obligations, losses, commitments, costs, deficiencies or damages (whether
absolute, accrued, conditional or otherwise and whether or not resulting from
third party claims), including out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, accountants, consultants and expert witnesses incurred
in investigating or defending these or in asserting any of their rights under
this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, ("Losses") resulting from or arising
out of:

           (i)        a breach of a representation or warranty when made or
                      deemed made by NATCO under this Agreement or an Ancillary
                      Agreement; or

           (ii)       a breach of an obligation of NATCO under this Agreement
                      or an Ancillary Agreement.

           9.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless NATCO, its Affiliates and
stockholders, and all such Persons' Representatives ("NATCO Indemnitees") from
and against, and pay or reimburse the NATCO Indemnitees for, any Losses
resulting from or arising out of:

           (i)        a breach of a representation or warranty when made or
                      deemed made by Purchaser under this Agreement or an
                      Ancillary Agreement; or

                                      34
<PAGE>
           (ii)       a breach of an obligation of Purchaser under this
                      Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement.

           9.3 Third Party Claims. If a third party asserts a claim against a
Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement ("Indemnified Party"):

           (i)        Notice of Claim: The Indemnified Party shall give notice
                      to the Party required to provide indemnification
                      ("Indemnifying Party") promptly after gaining actual
                      knowledge of the claim as to which indemnity may be
                      sought. If the Indemnified Party does not give this
                      notice, the Indemnifying Party must still fulfill its
                      indemnification obligations except to the extent that
                      this failure actually and materially prejudices the
                      Indemnifying Party.

           (ii)       Indemnifying Party Defends Claim: Subject to Section
                      9.3(v), the Indemnifying Party (at its own expense) may
                      assume the defense of the claim or Litigation resulting
                      from the claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
                      the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may
                      participate in that defense at its own expense.

           (iii)      Settlements: Subject to Section 9.3(v), the Indemnifying
                      Party shall not consent to entry of a judgment, or enter
                      into a settlement, without the Indemnified Party's prior
                      written consent, unless:

                      (A)        the judgment or settlement is only for
                                 monetary damages which the Indemnifying Party
                                 pays in full;

                      (B)        the Indemnifying Party does not admit
                                 responsibility on the Indemnified Party's
                                 behalf; and

                      (C)        each claimant or plaintiff unconditionally
                                 releases the Indemnified Party from all
                                 liability to it arising from the matter which
                                 is the subject of the claim.

           (iv)       Indemnifying Party Does Not Defend: If the Indemnifying
                      Party does not accept the defense of any matter as
                      provided above, the Indemnified Party may defend against
                      the claim and may settle the claim with the Indemnifying
                      Party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
                      withheld).

           (v)        Indemnified Party Assumes Control of Defense: The
                      Indemnified Party may take over and assume control of the
                      defense of the claim or Litigation resulting from the
                      claim, or seek a settlement, if, in its reasonable
                      judgment and in the written opinion of its counsel:

                                      35
<PAGE>
                      (A)        there is a conflict of interest between the
                                 Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
                                 in conducting the defense or seeking the
                                 settlement through use of a single counsel; or

                      (B)        the Indemnified Party has defenses and
                                 counterclaims different from, or additional
                                 to, the Indemnifying Party's defenses and
                                 counterclaims and which could be materially
                                 adverse to the Indemnifying Party,

                      and the Indemnifying Party must pay the reasonable fees
                      and expenses of one (but no more than one) such counsel
                      to all Indemnified Parties in respect of that claim or
                      litigation.

           (vi)       Cooperation: Each Party shall cooperate in defending any
                      claim or Litigation subject to this Section 9.3 and make
                      its records relating to the defense available to the
                      others (except communications subject to attorney-client
                      privilege or otherwise subject to a pre-existing
                      confidentiality obligation).

           9.4 Tax Treatment of Adjustments. For all Tax purposes, Purchaser
and NATCO shall treat any indemnity payment made under Section 9.1 or Section
9.2 as an adjustment to the purchase price paid under Section 1.1. However, to
the extent that the receipt of an indemnity payment under this Agreement is not
treated as a purchase price adjustment, the Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified and held harmless for any Tax consequences arising from the receipt
or accrual of an indemnity payment under this Agreement (including any payment
under this Section 9.4).

           9.5 Tax Adjustments.

           (a) Any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be reduced (at the time and in the manner discussed in Section
9.5(b)) by any actual Tax Benefit arising from the payment of the claim that
gave rise to the Party making an indemnity payment. If an Indemnified Party
realizes any such Tax Benefit, then the Indemnified Party shall pay an amount
to the Indemnifying Party equal to the Tax Benefit realized, provided that if
an amount payable by the Indemnified Party is reduced by the amount of such Tax
Benefit and there is a disallowance of such Tax Benefit by a taxing authority
(based on a reasonable and good faith determination by the Indemnified Party)
such that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to all or any portion of such
Tax Benefit, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party the
amount of the Tax Benefit that was disallowed.

           (b) A Tax Benefit will be considered to be realized for purposes of
this Section 9.5 on (x) the date on which the Tax Benefit is received as a
refund of Taxes, or

                                      36
<PAGE>
(y) to the extent that the Tax Benefit is not received as a refund of Taxes but
rather is claimed as an item that reduces liability for Taxes (on a with and
without basis), the due date (including extensions) of the Tax Return that
reflects such change in liability for Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall determine whether, for
purposes of this Section 9.5, a Tax Benefit is available to the Indemnified
Party in respect of the relevant indemnifiable claim, provided that such
determination shall be reasonable and shall be made in good faith. The
Indemnifying Party shall have opportunity to reasonably review the Indemnified
Party's calculation of the Tax Benefit realized (including a calculation
pursuant to which it is determined that there is no Tax Benefit available to
the Indemnified Party), provided that such review shall in no event relate to
the Indemnified Party's determination of how to report any items on its Tax
Return. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will
provide a letter from the Indemnified Party's accountants stating that the
Indemnified Party's calculation is consistent with the reporting of the
relevant items on the Indemnified Party's Tax Return.

           9.6 Time in Which to Bring Representation and Warranty Claims.

           (a) Expiration Dates: The representations and warranties in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any
examination by or on behalf of the Parties and the completion of the
Transactions, and expire as follows:

           (i)        the representations and warranties in Section 2.1
                      (Organization and Authorization), Section 2.2
                      (Capitalization), Section 2.3 (Subsidiaries and Ownership
                      Interests), Section 2.7 (Offering Valid), Section 3.1
                      (Organization and Authorization) and Section 3.5
                      (Accredited Investor; Investment Purpose) will survive
                      indefinitely;

           (ii)       the representations and warranties in Section 2.16
                      (Taxes) will expire 30 days after the statute of
                      limitations period;

           (iii)      the representations and warranties in Section 2.17
                      (Environmental Matters) will expire five years after the
                      date of this Agreement; and

           (iv)       the other representations and warranties in this
                      Agreement (except those in Section 5.4) will expire 14
                      months after the Closing Date.

           (b) Effect of Expiration Dates: No LR Indemnitee nor NATCO
Indemnitee can bring a claim under Section 9.1(i) or Section 9.2(i) in respect
of a breach of a representation or warranty after that representation or
warranty has expired under Section 9.6(a). After that expiration date, a LR
Indemnitee or NATCO Indemnitee can

                                      37
<PAGE>
continue to pursue a claim brought or noticed before the expiration date. The
expiration dates in Section 9.6(a) supersede any statutes of limitation that
otherwise apply.

           9.7 Limitations on Indemnification. Neither Party is obligated to
indemnify LR Indemnities or NATCO Indemnitees, as the case may be, under this
ARTICLE IX unless the aggregate amount of Losses sustained by the LR
Indemnitees or the NATCO Indemnitees, as the case may be, exceeds $250,000 and,
in such event, the indemnifying Party shall indemnify only for Losses in excess
of $250,000. In no event shall the total indemnification to be paid by a Party
under this ARTICLE IX exceed $15,000,000.

           9.8 Limits on Consequential Damages. Neither Party is liable to LR
Indemnitees or NATCO Indemnitees, as the case may be, for consequential,
special or punitive damages (except where an LR Indemnitee or NATCO Indemnitee
is liable for such damages to a third party and except for fraud and except
that the remedies in section 5.6 apply to the matters in Section 5.6).

           9.9 Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided for in this ARTICLE IX
are the sole and exclusive remedies for claims made after the Closing for
breach of this Agreement (except for claims for equitable remedies and claims
for fraud and except that the remedies in Section 5.6 apply to the matters in
Section 5.6).

with this Agreement and consummating the Transactions (including legal fees).

10.3     Amendments; Waivers, etc.

           (a) Writing: Subject to Section 8.1, no amendment or termination of
this Agreement, and no waiver under it, shall be binding unless made in writing
and duly signed by the Party against whom enforcement is sought.

           (b) Effect of Written Waiver: A waiver waives only the specific
matter described in the writing and does not impair the rights of the Party
granting the waiver in other respects or at other times. A Party's waiver of a
breach of or a default under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of a
similar breach or default.

           (c) Failure to Enforce is Not a Waiver: A Party's failure, on one or
more occasions, to enforce a provision of this Agreement, or to exercise a
right or privilege under this Agreement, does not constitute a waiver of that
provision, right or privilege.

           (d) Effect of Other Representations: A Party's rights and remedies
based on, arising out of or otherwise in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty or obligation, or failure to fulfill a condition, is
not limited by the fact that the act, omission,

                                      40
<PAGE>
occurrence or other state of facts on which the claim is based is also the
subject matter of another representation, warranty or obligation which is not
breached, or of a condition which is fulfilled.

           (e) Effect of Investigations: NATCO's representations and warranties
are not affected by investigations made by or on behalf of Purchaser (including
by its Representatives) or, subject to Section 6.4, because Purchaser (or its
Representatives) knew or should have known that the representation or warranty
is or might be inaccurate.

           10.4 Specific Performance. Purchaser and NATCO acknowledge that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents are not performed in accordance with their terms or are
otherwise breached. Therefore, the Parties are entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
and to specifically enforce their provisions in any court of the United States,
or any state of the United States, having jurisdiction (in addition to any
other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or equity).

           10.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is inoperative
or unenforceable for any reason, this shall not make the provision inoperative
or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or make any
other provision invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable. The Parties intend that
they would have entered into the remaining provisions.

           10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement is governed in all respects
(including as to validity, interpretation and effect) by the internal laws of
the state of New York without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules to
the extent those rules do not mandatorily apply by statute and would require or
permit the application of another jurisdiction's law.

           10.7 Jurisdiction. Each Party:

           (i)        irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                      courts of the state of New York and the United States
                      District Court for the Southern District of New York in
                      respect of Litigation directly or indirectly arising out
                      of or relating to this Agreement or documents
                      contemplated by this Agreement (including as to validity,
                      interpretation and effect), and in respect of the
                      Transactions;

           (ii)       waives and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such
                      Litigation, that the Litigation may not be brought or is
                      not maintainable in those courts, that the venue is not
                      appropriate or that those courts cannot enforce this
                      Agreement or that document; and

                                      41
<PAGE>
           (iii)      consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over
                      that Party and over the subject matter of any such
                      dispute and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by
                      Law, that the mailing of process or other papers in
                      connection with the Litigation in the manner provided in
                      Section 10.2, or in such other manner as may be permitted
                      by Law, shall be valid and sufficient service of that
                      process or paper.

           10.8 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY DISPUTE
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES. THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT HAS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR DOCUMENTS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING AS TO VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND
EFFECT), OR IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT:

           (i)        NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY
                      HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE OTHER
                      PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
                      ENFORCE THIS WAIVER;

           10.9 Successors and Assigns.

           (a) General: This Agreement binds and inures to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

           (b) Before Closing: Before the Closing, Purchaser may assign some or
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement only to (x) an entity

beneficial ownership or (y) a fund or similar investment vehicle exclusively
managed by Lime Rock Management LP, or by principals of Lime Rock Management
LP, provided that, in each case, the entity, fund or vehicle agrees in writing
to be bound by Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement and to make

Agreement.

           (d) Other: Except for assignments to the surviving entity in a
transaction contemplated by section 9(a)(v) or section 11 of the Certificate of
Designations, NATCO shall not assign any of its rights and obligations under

breach of this Section 10.9 shall be void ab initio.

           10.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in ARTICLE IX

Agreement.

           10.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including its Exhibits and
Schedules (including the Disclosure Schedules)), together with the Ancillary
Agreements, contains the Parties' entire understanding with respect to the
Transactions except for the Confidentiality Agreement between NATCO and Lime
Rock Management LP dated January 14, 2003.

           10.12 No Inconsistent Agreements. NATCO shall not enter into any
agreement, arrangement or other transaction which is inconsistent with the
rights granted to Purchaser by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

effective when each Party has signed and delivered a counterpart to the other
Party.

           10.14 Schedules; Exhibits. The Disclosure Schedules delivered under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall qualify NATCO's representations
and warranties in ARTICLE II, obligations in Section 5.2 and the definitions in
Section 11.1 as if they were fully incorporated into and made a part of this
Agreement although they need not be attached to each copy of this Agreement.
The mere inclusion of an item in one Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by NATCO that the
item represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that
the item constitutes a NATCO Material Adverse Effect.

         (i)      any period during which dividends on any Convertible

                  thereon and ending when all accrued and unpaid dividends for
                  all previous dividend periods on all Convertible Preferred

                  Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant and held by the
                  holder as of the date of such redemption

         exceeds

         (ii)     the aggregate consideration such holder paid to exercise the
                  Warrant prior to the date of such redemption (provided that
                  the consideration on a cashless exercise shall be deemed to
                  be zero).

         2. Designation and Amount. There shall be a series of Preferred Stock
that shall be designated as "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock," and the
number of shares constituting such series shall be 15,000. Such number of
shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board; provided,
however, that no decrease shall reduce the number of Convertible Preferred
Shares to less than the number of Convertible Preferred Shares then issued and
outstanding plus the number of Convertible Preferred Shares issuable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange of outstanding rights, options, warrants or
other securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for,
Convertible Preferred Shares.

         3. Dividends and Distributions.

         (a) Dividend Rate. Subject to the prior and superior rights of the
holders of any shares of Senior Stock, the holders of Convertible Preferred
Shares, in preference to the holders of any Junior Stock, shall be entitled to
receive, when declared by the Board out of funds legally available for the
purpose, semi-annual dividends payable in cash on each Semi-Annual Dividend
Payment Date, at the rate of 10.0% per share per annum of the Face Value
(subject to adjustment during a Default Period under Section 3(e)) (except that
the semi-annual dividend otherwise payable on June 15, 2003 shall not be

                                       7
<PAGE>

payable until July 1, 2003). Except as set forth in this Section 3, the
Convertible Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to receive dividends.

         (b) Periods in Which Dividends Accrue. Dividends shall begin to accrue
and be cumulative on outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares, whether or not
there are funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of such
dividend, from the issue date of such Convertible Preferred Shares (except that
dividends on any dividends added to the Face Value in accordance with Section
3(d) shall accrue from the date such amounts are added to the Face Value)
through the date on which the Convertible Preferred Shares are converted into
Common Stock or the date of redemption (unless on the date of redemption the
Corporation fails to pay or set apart for payment in accordance with Section
10(d)(ii) the redemption price, in which case dividends shall continue to
accrue and be cumulative through the date that the Corporation pays or sets
apart for payment in accordance with Section 10(d)(ii) the redemption price).

         (c) Record Date for Dividends. The Board may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of Convertible Preferred Shares entitled to receive
payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall
be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

         (d) Unpaid Dividends. If the amount of dividends paid in cash on the
Convertible Preferred Shares on a Semi-Annual Dividend Payment Date is less
than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such
shares (or that would be payable if the Corporation had funds legally available
for payment), (x) the dividends paid shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all Convertible Preferred Shares at the time
outstanding, (y) the accrued and unpaid dividends shall be added to the Face
Value on the Semi-Annual Dividend Payment Date and shall thereafter, until such
accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid in cash in full, be treated as part
of the Face Value and accrue additional dividends in respect thereof at the
rate determined in accordance in Section 3(a) and Section 3(e), and (z) until
all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid in cash in full, the
Corporation shall not, after that Semi-Annual Dividend Payment Date, declare or
pay any dividend on, make any other distribution on, or redeem or purchase or
otherwise acquire for consideration (or pay or make available any money for a
sinking fund for the redemption of) any Junior Stock.

         (e) Default Dividend Rate. At the commencement of a Default Period,
the dividend rate shall rise to 10.25% per annum. At the end of the Default
Period, the dividend rate shall return to 10% per annum.

         4. Voting Rights. The holders of Convertible Preferred Shares shall
have the following voting rights:

                                       8
<PAGE>
         (a) Numbers of Votes. On all matters submitted to a vote or consent of
the stockholders of the Corporation, or to a group of stockholders consisting
of or including the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares, unless provided
otherwise in this Certificate of Designations, each Convertible Preferred Share
shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such Convertible Preferred Share would
convert pursuant to Section 8(a) if converted on the record date for such vote
or, if no such record date is established, on the date such vote is taken or
such consent is obtained. Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the
holders of Convertible Preferred Shares and the holders of shares of Common
Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders of the Corporation.

         (b) Approval Rights. While any Convertible Preferred Shares are
outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the vote of the holders of a
majority or more of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares voting
separately as a class with one vote per share:

         (i)      amend, repeal or waive the application of (including in
                  connection with a merger, consolidation, combination or
                  otherwise) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation
                  or the By-Laws of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
                  or of this Certificate of Designations, in any manner, or
                  enter into any agreement or take any corporate action (or
                  permit any of its subsidiaries to enter into any agreement or
                  take any corporate action) which would materially alter or
                  change the powers, preferences or special rights of the
                  Convertible Preferred Shares so as to affect them adversely;
                  or

         (ii)     authorize or issue any class or series of stock of the
                  Corporation ranking senior to, or on a parity with, the
                  Convertible Preferred Shares in respect of dividends or in
                  respect of rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution
                  of the Corporation, or any additional Convertible Preferred
                  Shares.

         (c) Right to Elect a Director. For so long as more than 50% of the
Convertible Preferred Shares issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement
remain outstanding, the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares shall have the
right, voting separately as a class with one vote per share, to elect or
appoint one director at any annual or special meeting of stockholders or in a
written consent pursuant to Section 228 of the General Corporation Law, in
accordance with the procedures in Section 4(e).

         (d) Additional Right to Elect a Director During a Default Period.
During each Default Period, the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares, shall
have the right, voting

                                       9
<PAGE>
separately as a class with one vote per share, to elect or appoint a director
(not including the director elected or appointed under Section 4(c)) at any
annual or special meeting of stockholders or in a written consent pursuant to
Section 228 of the General Corporation Law in accordance with the procedures in
Section 4(e).

         (e) Procedures for Appointing Directors. The following procedures
shall apply to the election or appointment of directors by the holders of
Convertible Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 4(c) or Section 4(d):

         (i)      Such voting rights under Section 4(c) or Section 4(d) may be
                  exercised initially at a special meeting of holders of
                  Convertible Preferred Shares called pursuant to Section
                  4(e)(iv), at any annual meeting of stockholders or in any
                  written consent pursuant to Section 228 of the General
                  Corporation Law, and thereafter at annual meetings of
                  stockholders or in such written consents, provided that
                  neither such voting rights under Section 4(c) or Section 4(d)
                  nor the right to increase under Section 4(e)(iii), in certain
                  cases, the authorized number of directors shall be exercised
                  at a meeting unless the holders of one-third in number of the
                  Convertible Preferred Shares shall be present in person or by
                  proxy.

         (ii)     The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall
                  not affect the exercise by the holders of Convertible
                  Preferred Shares of such voting rights at a meeting.

         (iii)    In any case in which the holders of Convertible Preferred
                  Shares shall exercise such voting rights, they shall have the
                  right, voting as a class with one vote per share, to elect or
                  appoint directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the
                  Board as may then exist, up to one director pursuant to
                  Section 4(c) and one director pursuant to Section 4(d) or, if
                  such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect that
                  number of directors. The holders of the Convertible Preferred
                  Shares shall also have the right to require such increase in
                  the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit them
                  to elect or appoint one or two directors, as the case may be.

         (iv)     Unless the holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares have
                  previously exercised their right to elect or appoint one or
                  two directors, as the case may be, the Board may order, or
                  any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not
                  less than ten percent of the total number of Convertible
                  Preferred Shares may request, the calling of a special

                                      10
<PAGE>
                  meeting of the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares, which
                  meeting shall thereupon be called by the Chairman of the
                  Board, the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of
                  the Corporation.

         (v)      A meeting called pursuant to Section 4(e)(iv) shall be called
                  for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60
                  days after such order or request or, in default of the
                  calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or
                  request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any
                  stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less
                  than ten percent of the total number of Convertible Preferred
                  Shares (except that no such special meeting shall be called
                  during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the
                  date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders).

         (vi)     Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 4(e)(iv), and
                  of any annual meeting at which holders of Convertible
                  Preferred Shares are entitled to vote pursuant to Section
                  4(c) and/or Section 4(d), shall be given to each holder of
                  record of Convertible Preferred Shares by mailing a copy of
                  such notice by first class prepaid mail to such holder at his
                  or her last address as it appears on the books of the
                  Corporation.

         (f) Rights of Common Stock to Appoint. The holders of Common Stock,
and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to
be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of
Convertible Preferred Shares shall have exercised their right to elect or
appoint one director pursuant to Section 4(c) and, if applicable, one director
pursuant to Section 4(d).

         (g) Term of Office of Directors Appointed by Holders of Convertible
Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 4(h) and Section 4(i), the directors
elected or appointed by the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares pursuant to
Section 4(c) and Section 4(d) shall continue in office until their successors
shall have been elected by such holders. Subject to Section 4(e), any vacancy
in the Board may be filled by a vote of a majority of the remaining directors
theretofore elected or appointed by the holders of the class of stock which
elected or appointed the director whose office shall have become vacant.
References in this Section 4 to directors elected or appointed by the holders
of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected or appointed by
such directors to fill vacancies as provided in this Section 4(g).

         (iii)    the number of directors shall be the number provided for in
                  the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws irrespective of
                  any increase made pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii) in respect of
                  the director elected or appointed under Section 4(c) (such
                  number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any
                  manner provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation
                  or By-Laws); and

         (i)      the right of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares
                  to elect or appoint a director under Section 4(d) shall cease

                  Period);

         (ii)     the term of any director elected or appointed by the holders

         (iii)    the number of directors shall be the number provided for in

                  any increase made pursuant to Section 4(e)(iii) in respect of
                  the director elected or appointed under Section 4(d) (such
                  number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any
                  manner provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation
                  or By-Laws); and

         (iv)     any vacancy in the Board effected by Section 4(i)(ii) and

         5. Certain Restrictions.

         (a) Restrictions on the Corporation. During a Default Period, the
Corporation shall not:

         (i)      declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on,
                  or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
                  (or pay or make available any money for a sinking fund for
                  the redemption of) any Junior Stock, provided that the
                  Corporation may at any time declare and pay dividends and
                  make other distributions payable in shares of Common Stock;

         (ii)     declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions
                  on any Parity Stock, except dividends and distributions paid
                  ratably on the Convertible Preferred Shares and all such
                  Parity Stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in
                  proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all
                  such shares are then entitled; or

         (iii)    redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration (or
                  pay or make available any money for a sinking fund for the
                  redemption of) any Parity Stock, provided that the
                  Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise
                  acquire shares of any Parity Stock in exchange for shares of
                  Common Stock.

         (b) Restrictions on Subsidiaries. The Corporation shall not permit any
subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation
could, under Section 5(a), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such
time and in such manner.

         6. Reacquired Shares. Any Convertible Preferred Shares converted,
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner
whatsoever, including pursuant to Section 8, Section 10 or Section 11, shall be
retired and canceled promptly after the conversion, redemption, purchase or
other acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part
of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions
of the Board, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth
herein.

         7. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (a) Upon any liquidation
(voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no
distribution shall be made

                                      13
<PAGE>
to holders of shares of Junior Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of
Convertible Preferred Shares shall have received the Liquidation Preference for
each of their Convertible Preferred Shares.

         (b) If, however, there are not sufficient assets available to permit
payment in full of the aggregate Liquidation Preference for all outstanding
Convertible Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 7 and the liquidation
preferences of all other shares of Parity Stock, then such remaining assets
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such Convertible Preferred
Shares and such shares of Parity Stock in proportion to their respective
liquidation preferences.

         (c) The Corporation shall not declare as a dividend any payments
pursuant to this Section 7.

         8. Conversion.

         (a) Conversion at Holders' Option. Each Convertible Preferred Share
shall be convertible at the option of the holder under this Section 8, at any
time and from time to time, in whole or in part, into (x) a number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, free of liens and not subject
to preemptive rights, equal to the then Face Value of such Convertible
Preferred Share divided by the Conversion Price and (y) an amount, payable in
cash, equal to the amount of the dividends on such Convertible Preferred Share
that have accrued since the prior Semi-Annual Dividend Payment Date and have
not been paid in cash, whether or not earned or declared. The Board shall not
declare as a dividend any payments pursuant to this Section 8.

         (b) Procedure for Conversion at Holders' Option. Each holder of
Convertible Preferred Shares who wishes to convert some or all of such shares
into shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for
such shares, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation and give written
notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert a
specified number of Convertible Preferred Shares. A holder of Convertible
Preferred Shares may give an effective conversion notice even if the
Corporation has given notice of redemption under Section 10(c). The Corporation
shall then promptly issue and deliver to such holder (x) a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled as a result of the conversion, (y) if fewer than all the Convertible
Preferred Shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are converted,
a new certificate representing the Convertible Preferred Shares which were not
converted, and (z) any cash payment due to such holder pursuant to Section 8(a)
or Section 8(c).

         (c) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing
fractions of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Convertible
Preferred Shares. Instead of any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock
that would otherwise be

                                      14
<PAGE>
deliverable upon the conversion of Convertible Preferred Shares, the
Corporation shall pay an amount in cash equal to such fractional interest
multiplied by the Current Per Share Market Price of the Common Stock on the day
such Convertible Preferred Shares are deemed to have been converted.

         (d) No Charge for Certain Conversion Costs. The issuance of
certificates for shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Convertible
Preferred Shares shall be made without charge to the holders of such shares for
any issuance tax or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with
such conversion and/or the issuance of shares of Common Stock, except for any
tax payable in respect of any transfer into a name other than that of the
holder of record of the converted Convertible Preferred Shares.

         (e) Date of Conversion. Any conversion pursuant to this Section 8
shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on
the date of the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the
Convertible Preferred Shares to be converted, and the Person in whose name any
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock is issuable upon such
conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

         (f) Reservation of Shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall at
all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the conversion of the
Convertible Preferred Shares, such number of shares of Common Stock as may be
issued upon conversion of all outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares not
previously converted.

         9. Anti-Dilution Adjustments.

         (a) Dividends, Splits, Reorganizations etc. If the Corporation at any
time after the date of the first issuance of Convertible Preferred Shares:

         (i)      fixes a record date for a dividend or distribution on shares
                  of Common Stock payable in Common Stock;

         (ii)     subdivides or splits the outstanding shares of Common Stock;

         (iii)    combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
                  smaller number of shares;

         (iv)     changes the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by
                  reclassifying its Common Stock; or

         (v)      consolidates with, or merges with or into any other person,
                  or engages in any reorganization, reclassification or
                  recapitalization, in which the holders of Common Stock are

                                      15
<PAGE>
                  entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or other assets
                  with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock,

then the Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date for a
dividend or distribution, or on the effective date of such subdivision split,
combination, consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification or
recapitalization, shall remain outstanding (or, in a consolidation, merger or
other transaction in which the Corporation is not the surviving entity, shall
be exchanged for preferred stock, or other equivalent ownership interests, in
the surviving entity with equivalent rights to those of the Convertible
Preferred Shares), and the Conversion Price and the kind and amount of stock,
securities, cash or other assets issuable upon conversion of such Convertible
Preferred Shares (or other preferred stock or ownership interests, as the case
may be) shall be adjusted so that the conversion after such time shall entitle
the holder to receive the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, or stock,
securities, cash and other assets, which, if the Convertible Preferred Shares
had been converted immediately prior to such time, such holder would have been
entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, distribution, subdivision,
split, combination, consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification or
recapitalization. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the
effective date, retroactive to the record date in the case of a dividend or
distribution. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such
event occurs. This Section 9(a) shall not apply to any transaction to which
Section 11 applies.

         (b) Extraordinary Dividends and Distributions. If the Corporation at
any time after the date of the first issuance of Convertible Preferred Shares
fixes a record date for a dividend or distribution to all holders of its
outstanding Common Stock of evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, cash,
assets or securities (except Common Stock and Excluded Securities), and whether
by way of dividend, spin-off, reclassification, recapitalization, similar
corporate reorganization or otherwise (other than cash dividends which, in any
fiscal year, do not in the aggregate exceed 20% of the Corporation's net income
in the prior fiscal year) ("Other Distribution"), then the Corporation shall
make adequate provision so that each holder of Convertible Preferred Shares
will receive, in addition to shares of Common Stock upon conversion of its
Convertible Preferred Shares, at the election of the holders of a majority of
the Convertible Preferred Shares, either:

         (i)      the Other Distribution to which such holder would have been
                  entitled as a holder of shares of Common Stock if such holder
                  had converted its Convertible Preferred Shares immediately
                  prior to the record date for the Other Distribution; or

         (ii)     the cash equivalent of the Other Distribution.

                                      16
<PAGE>
Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such dividend is paid
or distribution occurs, and shall become effective on the date of the dividend
or distribution and be retroactive to the record date for the dividend or
distribution.

         (c) Sales Below the Current Per Share Market Price. Except to the
extent that an adjustment has already been made under Section 9(a), if the
Corporation at any time after the date of the first issuance of Convertible
Preferred Shares issues or sells any shares of Common Stock (except Excluded
Securities) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than
the Current Per Share Market Price on the date of such issuance or sale, the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted, as of the close of business on the date of
such issuance or sale, to an amount equal to the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or sale multiplied by the following
adjustment factor:

   Adjustment  =  (Current Common Shares  x  Current Price)  +  Consideration
      Factor      -----------------------------------------------------------
                            Resulting Common Shares x Current Price

   where:

   "Consideration" means the aggregate consideration paid or payable for
   the shares of Common Stock being issued or sold.

   "Current Common Shares" means the number of shares of Common Stock
   issued and outstanding immediately before the issuance or sale giving
   rise to the adjustment.

   "Current Price" means the Current Per Share Market Price on the day of
   the issuance or sale giving rise to the adjustment.

    "Resulting Common Shares" means the sum of the Current Common Shares
   and the number of shares of Common Stock included in the issuance or
   sale giving rise to the adjustment.

Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such issuance or sale
occurs.

         (d) Equity-Linked Securities. Except to the extent that an adjustment
has already been made under Section 9(a) or Section 9(b), if the Corporation at
any time after the date of the first issuance of Convertible Preferred Shares
issues, sells or grants any Equity-Linked Securities (except Excluded
Securities) and the sum of the aggregate consideration paid or payable for the
issuance, sale or grant of such Equity-Linked Securities plus the minimum
consideration payable to exercise, convert or exchange all such Equity-Linked
Securities for shares of Common Stock, all divided by the maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of all
such Equity-Linked Securities, is less than the Current Per Share Market Price
on the date of such issuance, sale or grant:

                                      17
<PAGE>
         (i)      subject to Section 9(d)(ii), the maximum number of shares of
                  Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
                  of all such Equity-Linked Securities shall be deemed to have
                  been issued as of the date of the issuance, sale or grant of
                  such Equity-Linked Securities and the Conversion Price shall
                  be adjusted pursuant to Section 9(c) as though the
                  Corporation had issued such maximum number of shares of
                  Common Stock and received as consideration for the issuance
                  of such shares of Common Stock an amount equal to the sum of
                  the aggregate consideration paid or payable for the issuance,
                  sale or grant of such Equity-Linked Securities plus the
                  minimum consideration payable to exercise, convert or
                  exchange all such Equity-Linked Securities for shares of
                  Common Stock;

         (ii)     if, over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of
                  specified events (except by reason of anti-dilution
                  adjustments similar to those in this Certificate of
                  Designations), the minimum consideration payable to exercise,
                  convert or exchange such Equity-Linked Securities for shares
                  of Common Stock is reduced, or the maximum number of shares
                  of Common Stock to which holders of such Equity-Linked
                  Securities are entitled upon exercise, conversion or exchange
                  is increased, the amount of consideration deemed to be
                  received by the Corporation, or the number of shares of
                  Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
                  of such Equity-Linked Securities, shall be recalculated upon
                  the occurrence or non-occurrence of such events using such
                  reduced minimum consideration amount or such increased
                  maximum share number (although, if the minimum consideration
                  payable to exercise, convert or exchange all such
                  Equity-Linked Securities for shares of Common Stock is
                  subsequently increased, or the maximum number of shares of
                  Common Stock to which holders are entitled upon exercise,
                  conversion or exchanged of all such Equity-Linked Securities
                  is subsequently decreased, the amount of consideration deemed
                  to be received, or number of shares of Common Stock deemed to
                  have been issued, by the Corporation shall again be
                  recalculated using the increased minimum consideration amount
                  or such decreased maximum share number); and

         (iii)    if any such Equity-Linked Securities expire unexercised, the
                  Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion
                  Price which would then be in effect had an adjustment been
                  made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so
                  issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually

                                      18
<PAGE>

                  issued or sold upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
                  such Equity-Linked Securities, and such shares of Common
                  Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the aggregate
                  consideration received upon such exercise, conversion or
                  exchange plus the aggregate consideration, if any, received
                  for the issuance or sale of all such Equity-Linked
                  Securities, whether or not exercised, converted or exchanged.

Adjustments under this Section 9(d) shall be made successively whenever the
Corporation issues, sells or grants Equity-Linked Securities. Except as
provided in Section 9(d)(iii), no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock on
the exercise, conversion or exchange of such Equity-Linked Securities.

         (e) Rights Distributed Under the Rights Agreement. While the Rights
Agreement remains in effect:

         (i)      holders who convert Convertible Preferred Shares before the
                  Distribution Date will receive, in addition to the shares of
                  Common Stock issued on the conversion, one Right for each
                  such share of Common Stock;

         (ii)     if the Distribution Date occurs, the Rights that become
                  exercisable will be treated as having been issued for no
                  consideration as of the Distribution Date, and Rights issued
                  after the Distribution Date will be treated as having been
                  issued for no consideration as of their issue date and,
                  except as provided in Section 9(e)(iv), an adjustment will be
                  made accordingly under Section 9(d) or, if applicable,
                  Section 9(f) and Section 9(g);

         (iii)    no adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made under this
                  Section 9 for the issuance of Rights except as provided in
                  Section 9(e)(ii); and

         (iv)     no adjustment will be made under this Section 9 for the
                  benefit of a holder of Convertible Preferred Shares (or any
                  of its "Affiliates" or "Associates" as defined in the Rights
                  Agreement) where that holder became an "Acquiring Person"
                  under the Rights Agreement and, as a result, caused the
                  Rights to become exercisable.

         (f) Other Dilutive Securities. The Corporation shall not (i) issue,
sell or grant equity securities (except Common Stock and Equity-Linked
Securities) that participate with shares of Common Stock in dividends,
distributions or other rights ("Other Dilutive

                                      19
<PAGE>
Securities"), or (ii) declare or pay dividends or distributions (whether of
evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, cash, assets or securities) in
respect of Other Dilutive Securities or Equity-Linked Securities unless, in
each case, this Section 9 is first amended to preserve without dilution, on a
basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in
Section 9, the conversion rights of the Convertible Preferred Shares.

         (g) Other Dilutive Events. If any event occurs to which Section 9 does
not strictly apply but as to which the failure to make an adjustment would not
fairly protect the conversion rights in respect of the Convertible Preferred
Shares in accordance with the essential intent and principles of Section 9,
then the Corporation shall appoint a firm of independent certified public
accountants of recognized national standing to give their opinion on the
adjustment needed to preserve without dilution, on a basis consistent with the
essential intent and principles established in Section 9, the conversion rights
of the Convertible Preferred Shares. On receiving this opinion, the Corporation
will promptly mail a copy of it to each holder of Convertible Preferred Shares
and shall make the adjustments described in it.

         (h) Valuation of Consideration and Non-Cash Distributions. If any of
the consideration received or to be received by the Corporation in respect of
shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities is in a form other than
cash, or the Corporation or any other person distributes assets (other than
cash) or securities to securityholders, the fair market value of such
consideration, assets or securities will be used in determining adjustments
under this Section 9. The fair market value shall be determined in good faith
by the Board unless holders of a majority of the outstanding Convertible
Preferred Shares object to the Board's determination, in which case the Board
shall retain an independent appraiser reasonably satisfactory to such holders
to determine the fair market value. If the fair market value so determined by
the independent appraiser is more than 90% (in the case of non-cash
consideration received or to be received by the Corporation) or is less than
110% (in the case of distributions of non-cash assets or securities) of the
fair market value determined by the Board, the objecting holders shall pay the
independent appraiser's fees and expenses. When the Corporation issues, sells
or grants shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities, the amount of
consideration paid or payable to the Corporation in respect of such shares or
securities and taken into account under this Section 9 shall not include any
amounts paid for accrued dividends or accrued interest.

         (i) Allocating Consideration. If shares of Common Stock or
Equity-Linked Securities are issued, sold or granted together with other stock
or securities or other assets of the Corporation for an aggregate consideration
that covers both, the consideration paid or payable to the Corporation for the
shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities shall be the portion of the
aggregate consideration paid or payable to the Corporation that may be
reasonably determined in good faith by the Board to be allocable to such shares
of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities unless holders of a majority of the


                                      20
<PAGE>
outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares object to the Board's determination,
in which case the Board shall retain an independent appraiser reasonably
satisfactory to such holders to determine the allocation. If the amounts
allocated to the shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities as
determined by the independent appraiser do not differ by 10% or more from the
allocation determined by the Board, the objecting holders shall pay the
independent appraiser's fees and expenses.

         (j) Notice of Adjustments. Calculations under this Section 9 shall be
made to the nearest four decimal points. The Corporation shall notify holders
of Convertible Preferred Shares promptly after making any adjustment under this
Section 9, and include reasonable detail on the event requiring such adjustment
and the calculation of such adjustment. On a holder's request at any time, the
Corporation shall promptly deliver to such holder a notice stating the then
Conversion Price (and showing how it was calculated) and the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount of any other stock, securities, cash or other
assets which would at that time be received on converting the holder's
Convertible Preferred Shares.

         (k) New York Stock Exchange Rules. No adjustment shall be made
pursuant to this Section 9 if such adjustment would constitute a material
violation of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other securities
exchange on which any of the Corporation's securities are listed or admitted to
trading.

         (l) Adjustments to Other Shares. If, as a result of this Section 9,
holders of Convertible Preferred Shares upon subsequent conversion shall become
entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than
Common Stock, the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion
shall be subject to adjustment on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to
those in this Section 9.

         10. Redemption.

         (a) Redemption at Corporation's Election. On or at any time after the
fifth anniversary of the first issue of Convertible Preferred Shares, the
Corporation may elect to redeem for cash the outstanding Convertible Preferred
Shares in whole or in part from time to time, at a redemption price per share
equal to the Face Value, plus the amount of dividends on such Convertible
Preferred Share that have accrued since the prior Semi-Annual Dividend Payment
Date and which have not been paid in cash (whether or not earned or declared),
as of the last Trading Day before the redemption date.

         (b) Redemption of Less than All Convertible Preferred Shares. Subject
to the Securities Purchase Agreement, if fewer than all the outstanding
Convertible Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be
redeemed shall be determined by the Board and the shares to be redeemed shall
be

                                      21
<PAGE>
determined by lot or pro rata as may be determined by the Board or by any
other method that may be determined by the Board in its sole discretion to be
equitable.

         (c) Notice of Redemption. Notice of any such redemption shall be given
by mailing to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares to be redeemed a
notice of such redemption, by first class prepaid mail, not later than the
twentieth day and not earlier than the sixtieth day before the date fixed for
redemption, at their last address as shall appear upon the books of the
Corporation. Each such notice shall state:

         (i)      the redemption date;

         (ii)     the number of shares to be redeemed and, if fewer than all
                  the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number
                  of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;

         (iii)    the redemption price;

         (iv)     the place or places where certificates for such shares are to
                  be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and

         (v)      that, on the close of business on such redemption date,
                  dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue
                  and such shares will be deemed to be no longer outstanding
                  (unless the Corporation does not on the redemption date
                  either pay the redemption price or set aside the redemption
                  price for payment in accordance with Section 10(d)(ii)).

Failure to duly give such notice by first class prepaid mail, or any defect in
such notice, to any holder of Convertible Preferred Shares shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of Convertible Preferred Shares
held by any other holder.

         (d) Consequences of Redemption Date. From the redemption date,
dividends will cease to accrue on the Convertible Preferred Shares being
redeemed, and such Convertible Preferred Shares shall be deemed to be no longer
outstanding, and all rights of the holders of such Convertible Preferred Shares
(except the right to receive from the Corporation the redemption price and any
interest under Section 10(e)) shall cease provided that:

         (i)      the holders of such Convertible Preferred Shares have
                  received the notice mailed in accordance with Section 10(c);
                  and

         (ii)     on or before the redemption date, the Corporation has set
                  aside the funds necessary for such redemption, separate and
                  apart from its other funds in trust for the pro rata benefit
                  of the holders of such Convertible Preferred Shares, so as to
                  be, and to continue to be, available for that purpose.

                                      22
<PAGE>
         (e) Surrender of Certificate. On surrender of the certificates for any
Convertible Preferred Shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for
transfer), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the redemption
price. If the Corporation does not pay the redemption price within five
Business Days of a holder of such Convertible Preferred Shares duly
surrendering its certificate, the Corporation shall pay such holder interest on
the unpaid redemption price from the end of such period at a rate of 10.25% per
annum. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such surrendered
certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the
unredeemed shares.

         (f) Effect of Conversion or Other Redemption. If a notice of
conversion is given pursuant to Section 8 or Section 11, or notice to redeem is
given pursuant to Section 11, before the redemption date fixed by the
Corporation pursuant to this Section 10, the right of the Corporation to redeem
such Convertible Preferred Shares under this Section 10 shall terminate
(subject to being revived upon the Corporation giving a further notice under
Section 10(c) if the conversion or redemption pursuant to Section 8 or Section
11 does not occur due to the actions of the holder who gave the notice),
notwithstanding that the Corporation has mailed a notice of redemption. If the
Corporation defaults in setting aside or making payment in cash of the
redemption price under Section 10(d)(ii) or Section 10(e) in respect of
Convertible Preferred Shares, the holders of such Convertible Preferred Shares
may give a notice pursuant to Section 8 or Section 11 if otherwise eligible to
do so, in which case such shares shall be treated as not having been redeemed
under this Section 10 and the right of the Corporation to redeem such shares
under this Section 10 shall terminate.

         (g) No Dividend. The Board shall not declare as a dividend any
payments pursuant to this Section 10.

         11. Change of Control.

         (a) Notice to Holders of Change of Control. The Corporation shall, not
fewer than 30 days prior to the consummation of a transaction to which it is or
will be a party that will result in a Change of Control or within 15 days of
becoming aware of the occurrence of any other Change of Control, mail to each
holder of Convertible Preferred Shares a notice notifying the holder of:

         (i)      the Change of Control;

         (ii)     the circumstances and facts regarding the Change of Control;

                                      23
<PAGE>
         (iii)    the holder's right to elect, within 15 days of receiving the
                  notice, to require the Corporation to redeem for cash some or
                  all of the holder's Convertible Preferred Shares or, at the
                  holder's election, to convert some or all of the holder's
                  Convertible Preferred Shares (and state that the procedures
                  for making such an election are in Section 11(d) of this
                  Certificate of Designations);

         (iv)     the redemption price payable if the holder so elects to have
                  the Corporation redeem the holder's Convertible Preferred
                  Shares;

         (v)      the number of shares of Common Stock, and the amount of all
                  cash payments, that the holder will receive if it so elects
                  to have the Corporation convert the holder's Convertible
                  Preferred Shares; and

         (vi)     the Corporation's right, within 30 days after the end of the
                  15 day period during which the holder can exercise its
                  election, to require the holder to convert some or all of its
                  remaining Convertible Preferred Shares.

         (b) Holders' Right to Sell to the Corporation or to Convert. Each
holder of Convertible Preferred Shares may, within 15 days of receiving the
Corporation's notice pursuant to Section 11(a), but subject to the occurrence
of the Change of Control, require the Corporation to:

         (i)      redeem for cash some or all of such holder's Convertible
                  Preferred Shares, at an aggregate redemption price equal to
                  the greater of:

                  (A)      the sum of:

                                    (1)     the product of $1,000 (as adjusted
                                            for any stock splits, combination,
                                            reclassification or similar event
                                            involving the Convertible Preferred
                                            Shares) multiplied by the aggregate
                                            number of Convertible Preferred
                                            Shares to be redeemed under this
                                            Section 11(b)(i), plus

                                    (2)     an amount (which may not be less

                                    Convertible Preferred Shares plus the
                                    aggregate amount of dividends on such
                                    Convertible Preferred Shares that have
                                    accrued since the prior Semi-Annual
                                    Dividend Payment Date, and which have not
                                    been paid in cash, whether or not earned or
                                    declared; or

                  (ii)     convert some or all of such holder's Convertible
                           Preferred Shares into the number of shares of Common
                           Stock, and the cash payment, determined as if
                           Section 8(a) applied (or if, in connection with a
                           merger, consolidation or similar transaction
                           constituting a Change of Control, holders of shares
                           of Common Stock were entitled to receive other
                           stock, securities, cash or assets in respect of
                           their shares of Common Stock, the holder shall
                           receive such other stock, securities, cash or assets
                           which, if such Convertible Preferred Shares had been
                           converted immediately prior to such Change of
                           Control, the holder would have been entitled to
                           receive plus an amount, payable in cash, equal to
                           the amount of dividends on such Convertible
                           Preferred Shares that have accrued since the prior
                           Semi-Annual Payment Date through the date of the
                           Change of Control and have not been paid in cash,
                           whether or not earned or declared).

         (c) Payment on Conversion on or before Third Anniversary. If any
Convertible Preferred Share is converted pursuant to Section 11(b)(ii) or
Section 11(e) on or before the third anniversary of the first issuance of
Convertible Preferred Shares, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder
an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued on such Convertible
Preferred Share through the third anniversary of the first issuance of
Convertible Preferred Shares, minus the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of
dividends paid in cash through the date of conversion, (y) the aggregate amount
of dividends added to the Face Value under Section 3(d) and not thereafter paid
in cash and (z) the cash payment pursuant to Section 11(b)(ii) or Section
11(e). Such payment is in addition to the shares of Common Stock or the other
stock, securities, cash or assets issued upon the conversion.

         (d) Procedure for Exercising Holders' Rights. A holder who wishes to
have the Corporation redeem Convertible Preferred Shares, or to convert
Convertible Preferred Shares under Section 11(b), shall give written notice
within the time period specified in Section 11(b) to the Corporation at such
office that such holder elects to have the Corporation redeem such shares or to
convert such shares and shall state in such notice

                                      25
<PAGE>
the number of Convertible Preferred Shares to be redeemed or converted. Such
notice shall be accompanied by the certificate or certificates for such shares,
duly endorsed. The Corporation shall immediately prior to or simultaneously
with the consummation of the Change of Control (or else promptly, if the
Corporation gave its notice under Section 11(b) after the Change of Control)
issue and deliver to such holder (w) the cash payment to which such holder is
entitled on any such redemption, (x) a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock or the other stock, securities, cash or assets
to which such holder is entitled as a result of any such conversion, (y) if
fewer than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed or converted, a new certificate representing the Convertible Preferred
Shares which were not redeemed or converted and (z) any cash payments to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 11(b)(ii) and Section 11(c).

         (e) Conversion at the Corporation's Request. At any time after the end
of the period during which holders of Convertible Preferred Shares are entitled
to exercise their rights under Section 11(b), the Corporation shall have the
right to give notice to the holders of Convertible Preferred Shares requiring
them to convert some or all of their Convertible Preferred Shares in respect of
which they did not exercise their rights under Section 11(b) in the manner and
with the results set forth in Section 11(b)(ii) and Section 11(c). Promptly
upon receiving such a notice (and in any event prior to the consummation of the
Change of Control if the Corporation gave its notice under Section 11(a) no
fewer than 30 days before the Change of Control), each such holder shall
surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Corporation. The Corporation shall immediately prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation of the Change of Control (or else
promptly, if the Corporation gave its notice under Section 11(b) after the
Change of Control) issue and deliver to such holder (x) a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock or the other stock,
securities, cash or assets to which such holder is entitled as a result of the
conversion, (y) if fewer than all the Convertible Preferred Shares represented
by any such surrendered certificate are converted, a new certificate
representing the Convertible Preferred Shares which were not converted, and (z)
any cash payments which to such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
11(b)(ii) and Section 11(c).

         (f) Effective Date of Conversion. Any conversion pursuant to this
Section 11 shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the Change of
Control, and the Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of such
shares of Common Stock on such date.

         (g) Other Conversion Provisions Apply. Section 8(c), Section 8(d) and
Section 8(f) shall apply to conversions pursuant to this Section 11.

                                      26
<PAGE>
         (h) No Dividend. The Board shall not declare as a dividend any
payments pursuant to this Section 11.

         12. Obligations Regarding Mergers and Other Transactions. The
Corporation will not consummate a transaction described in Section 9(a)(v), or
a merger, consolidation or similar transaction constituting a Change of
Control, unless each person (except the Corporation) required to deliver stock,
securities, cash or other assets in connection with that transaction assumes,
by written instrument delivered to, and reasonably satisfactory to, each record
holder of Convertible Preferred Shares:

         (i)      equivalent obligations to those in this Certificate of
                  Designations (and, if the Corporation survives the
                  consummation of the transaction and the Convertible Preferred
                  Shares or other preferred equity securities issued in
                  exchange for the Convertible Preferred Shares are
                  outstanding, this assumption is in addition to, and does not
                  release the Corporation from, the Corporation's continuing
                  obligations under this Certificate of Designations); and

         (ii)     the obligation to deliver to the holder the stock,
                  securities, cash or other assets to which the holder is
                  entitled on the conversion of the Convertible Preferred
                  Shares or the securities for which they were exchanged.

If the holders of a majority of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares
request, this instrument shall be accompanied by a written opinion of counsel
to each such person, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to such
holders, stating that such person is obligated to deliver to the holders of
Convertible Preferred Shares, at the time required by this Certificate of
Designations, the stock, securities, cash or other assets to which the holder
is entitled under Section 9(a)(v) or Section 11(b)(ii) as a result of or
following the transaction, and that terms equivalent to those in the
Certificate of Designations will apply to such stock, securities, cash or other
assets.

         13. Good Faith Actions. The Corporation shall not avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in good faith
assist in carrying out all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to protect the rights of the holders of Convertible Preferred
Shares hereunder against impairment (including the rights to convert
Convertible Preferred Shares and rights upon a Change of Control).

         14. Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Certificate
of Designations is held to be invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced
by reason of any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of this
Certificate of Designations which can be given effect without the invalid,
unlawful or unenforceable provision shall remain in effect.

                             Expiring on [ ], 2006

                                                                  New York, N.Y.
                                                                  [Closing Date]

No. W-001

                  NATCO Group Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NATCO"), for value
received, hereby certifies that Lime Rock Partners II, L.P., a Cayman Islands

         1. Exercise of Warrant.

         1.1 Manner of Exercise by the Holder.

         (a) Exercise for Cash: The holder of the Warrant or any part of it
("Holder"), may exercise it, in whole or in part, during normal business hours
on any Business Day by:

         (i)      surrendering the Warrant, with a subscription in the form of
                  Exhibit A (or a reasonable facsimile) ("Subscription Notice")
                  duly executed by the Holder, to NATCO at its principal office
                  (or, if the exercise is in connection with an underwritten
                  Public Offering of shares of Common Stock subject to the
                  Warrant, at the location at which NATCO agrees to deliver the
                  shares of Common Stock subject to the offering); and

         (ii)     paying, in cash, by certified or official bank check payable
                  to the order of NATCO or by wire transfer in same-day funds,
                  the amount ("Aggregate Exercise Price") equal to the Exercise
                  Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock that
                  the Holder is entitled to receive following that exercise.

The "Exercise Date" is the date on which such delivery and payment has
occurred. The Holder is then entitled to receive the number of duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined
under Section 2.

         (b) Cashless Exercise: Instead of tendering the Aggregate Exercise
Price to NATCO, the Holder may exercise the Warrant by performing a "Cashless
Exercise" of the Warrant, in whole or in part, by surrendering the Warrant to
NATCO, with a duly executed Subscription Notice marked "Cashless Exercise" and
specifying the number of shares of Common Stock the Holder wishes to obtain out
of the total for which the Warrant is exercisable. The Holder will then:

         (i)      be deemed to have exercised this Warrant for the number of
                  shares of Common Stock so specified in the Subscription
                  Notice; and

         (ii)     be entitled to receive that lesser number of duly authorized,
                  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
                  Stock having a value (at the Current Per Share Market Price
                  on the Business Day preceding the Exercise Date) of:

                  (A)      the Current Per Share Market Price per share of
                           Common Stock on the Business Day preceding the
                           Exercise Date multiplied by the number of the shares
                           of Common Stock into which the Warrant, or the part

                                       2
<PAGE>
                           of it specified by the Holder, would have been
                           exercisable under Section 1.1(a) on the Holder
                           paying the Aggregate Exercise Price

                           minus

                  (B)      the Aggregate Exercise Price the Holder would have
                           been required to pay under Section 1.1(a) in respect
                           of the exercise.

         1.2 When Exercise Deemed Effected. Each exercise of the Warrant shall
be deemed to have been effected immediately before the close of business on the
Exercise Date. The person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock issuable on the exercise under Section
1.1 shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record at this
time.

         1.3 Delivering Stock Certificates, etc. As soon as practicable after
the Holder exercises the Warrant, in whole or in part, and in any event within
five Business Days after the Exercise Date (unless the exercise is in
connection with an underwritten Public Offering of shares of Common Stock
subject to the Warrant, in which case, concurrently with the exercise), NATCO
at its expense (including paying taxes payable on issuing the shares, but
excluding transfer taxes) shall cause to be issued in the name of and delivered
to the Holder or, as the Holder (on paying any transfer taxes) may direct:

         (i)      a certificate or certificates for the number of duly
                  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
                  shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled on the
                  exercise (in such denominations as the Holder reasonably
                  requests in the Subscription Notice) plus, in lieu of any
                  fractional share to which the Holder would otherwise be
                  entitled, cash in an amount equal to the same fraction of the
                  Current Per Share Market Price per share of Common Stock on
                  the Business Day preceding the Exercise Date; and

         (ii)     in case the exercise is in part only, a new Warrant or
                  Warrants (in such denominations as the Holder reasonably
                  requests) equivalent to this Warrant, calling in the
                  aggregate on the face or faces for the number of shares of
                  Common Stock equal to the number of such shares for which
                  this Warrant was exercisable immediately before the partial
                  exercise minus the number of such shares specified by the
                  Holder in the Subscription Notice on exercise under Section
                  1.1.

                                       3
<PAGE>
         2. Number of Shares of Common Stock Issuable on Exercise.

         2.1 Exercise Price; Number of Shares. The "Exercise Price", which
initially is $10.00, shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time under
this Section 2. The number of shares of Common Stock which the Holder is
entitled to receive on each exercise of the Warrant is determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock which would otherwise (but for
this Section 2) be issuable on the exercise by a fraction of which (x) the
numerator is $10.00 and (y) the denominator is the Exercise Price in effect on
the Exercise Date.

         2.2 Stock Dividends, Subdivisions, Combinations, Mergers, etc. If
NATCO after the date of this Warrant:

         (i)      fixes a record date for a dividend or distribution on shares
                  of Common Stock payable in Common Stock;

         (ii)     subdivides or splits the outstanding shares of Common Stock;

         (iii)    combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
                  smaller number of shares;

         (iv)     changes the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by
                  reclassifying its Common Stock; or

         (v)      consolidates with, or merges with or into any other Person,
                  or engages in a reorganization, reclassification or
                  recapitalization, in which the holders of Common Stock are
                  entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or other assets
                  with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock,

then the Exercise Price and the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or
other assets issuable on exercise of the Warrant on or after the record date
for the dividend or distribution, or the effective date of the subdivision,
split, combination, consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification or
recapitalization, shall be adjusted so that the exercise of the Warrant after
that time entitles the Holder to receive the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock, or stock, securities, cash and other assets, which, if the
Warrant had been exercised immediately before that time, the Holder would have
been entitled to receive by virtue of the dividend, distribution, subdivision,
split, combination, consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification or
recapitalization. This adjustment shall become effective immediately after the
effective date, retroactive to the record date in the case of a dividend or
distribution. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such
event occurs. This Section 2.2 shall not apply to transactions to which Section
3 applies.

                                       4

         2.3 Extraordinary Dividends and Distributions. If, at any time after
the date of this Warrant, NATCO fixes a record date for a dividend or
distribution to all holders of its outstanding Common Stock of evidences of
indebtedness of NATCO, cash, assets or securities (except Common Stock and
Excluded Securities), and whether by way of dividend, spin-off,
reclassification, recapitalization, similar corporate reorganization or
otherwise (other than cash dividends which, in any fiscal year, do not in the
aggregate exceed 20% of NATCO's net income in the prior fiscal year) ("Other
Distribution"), then NATCO shall make adequate provision so that the Holder
will receive, in addition to shares of Common Stock on exercise of the Warrant,
at the election of the holders of a majority of the interests under the Warrant
(measured with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock for which each
holder can exercise its interests), either:

         (i)      the Other Distribution to which the Holder would have been
                  entitled as a holder of shares of Common Stock if the Holder
                  had exercised the Warrant immediately before the record date
                  for the Other Distribution; or

         (ii)     the cash equivalent of the Other Distribution.

Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such dividend is paid
or distribution occurs, and shall become effective on the date of the dividend
or distribution and be retroactive to the record date for the dividend or
distribution.

         2.4 Sales Below the Current Per Share Market Price. Except to the
extent that an adjustment has already been made under Section 2.2, if NATCO
after the date of this Warrant issues or sells any shares of Common Stock
(except Excluded Securities) without consideration or for a consideration per
share less than the Current Per Share Market Price on the date of such issuance
or sale, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted, as of the close of business on
the date of that issuance or sale, to an amount equal to the Exercise Price in
effect immediately before that issuance or sale multiplied by the following
adjustment factor:

     Adjustment  =  (Current Common Shares  x  Current Price)  +  Consideration
        Factor      -----------------------------------------------------------
                               Resulting Common Shares x Current Price

     where:

     "Consideration" means the aggregate consideration paid or payable for
     the shares of Common Stock being issued or sold.

     "Current Common Shares" means the number of shares of Common Shares
      issued and outstanding immediately before the issuance or sale giving
      rise to the adjustment.

      "Current Price" means the Current Per Share Market Price on the day of
      the issuance or sale giving rise to the adjustment.

                                       5
<PAGE>
      "Resulting Common Shares" means the sum of the Current Common Shares and
      the number of shares of Common Stock included in the issuance or sale
      giving rise to the adjustment.

Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any such issuance or sale
occurs.

         2.5 Equity-Linked Securities. Except to the extent that an adjustment
has already been made under Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, if, after the date of
this Warrant, NATCO issues, sells or grants any Equity-Linked Securities
(except Excluded Securities) and the sum of the aggregate consideration paid or
payable for the issuance, sale or grant of such Equity-Linked Securities plus
the minimum consideration payable to exercise, convert or exchange all such
Equity-Linked Securities for shares of Common Stock, all divided by the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise, conversion or exchange
of all such Equity-Linked Securities, is less than the Current Per Share Market
Price on the date of such issuance, sale or grant:

         (i)      subject to Section 2.5(ii), the maximum number of shares of
                  Common Stock issuable on exercise, conversion or exchange of
                  all such Equity-Linked Securities shall be deemed to have
                  been issued as of the date of the issuance, sale or grant of
                  such Equity-Linked Securities and the Exercise Price shall be
                  adjusted under Section 2.4 as though NATCO had issued such
                  maximum number of shares of Common Stock and received as
                  consideration for the issuance of such shares of Common Stock
                  an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate consideration
                  paid or payable for the issuance, sale or grant of such
                  Equity-Linked Securities plus the minimum consideration
                  payable to exercise, convert or exchange all such
                  Equity-Linked Securities for shares of Common Stock;

         (ii)     if, over time or on the occurrence or non-occurrence of
                  specified events (except by reason of anti-dilution
                  adjustments similar to those in this Warrant), the minimum
                  consideration payable to exercise, convert or exchange such
                  Equity-Linked Securities for shares of Common Stock is
                  reduced, or the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to
                  which holders of such Equity-Linked Securities are entitled
                  on exercise, conversion or exchange is increased, the amount
                  of consideration deemed to be received by NATCO, or the
                  number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise,
                  conversion or exchange of such Equity-Linked Securities,
                  shall be recalculated on the occurrence or non-occurrence of

                                       6
<PAGE>
                  such events using such reduced minimum consideration amount
                  or such increased maximum share number (although, if the
                  minimum consideration payable to exercise, convert or
                  exchange all such Equity-Linked Securities for shares of
                  Common Stock is subsequently increased, or the maximum number
                  of shares of Common Stock to which holders are entitled on
                  exercise, conversion or exchanged of all such Equity-Linked
                  Securities is subsequently decreased, the amount of
                  consideration deemed to be received, or number of shares of
                  Common Stock deemed to have been issued, by NATCO shall again
                  be recalculated using the increased minimum consideration
                  amount or the decreased maximum share number); and

         (iii)    if any such Equity-Linked Securities expire unexercised, the
                  Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise
                  Price which would then be in effect had an adjustment been
                  made on the basis that the only shares of Common Stock so
                  issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
                  issued or sold on the exercise, conversion or exchange of
                  such Equity-Linked Securities, and such shares of Common
                  Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the aggregate
                  consideration received on such exercise, conversion or
                  exchange plus the aggregate consideration, if any, received
                  for the issuance or sale of all such Equity-Linked
                  Securities, whether or not exercised, converted or exchanged.

Any reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Warrant is
exercisable as a result of this Section 2.5 shall be applied in its entirety to
the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Warrant is exercisable as of
the date the new adjustment is made. Adjustments under this Section 2.5 shall
be made successively whenever NATCO issues, sells or grants Equity-Linked
Securities. Except as provided in this Section 2.5, no further adjustment of
the Exercise Price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares
of Common Stock on the exercise, conversion or exchange of Equity-Linked
Securities.

         2.6 Rights Distributed Under the Rights Agreement. While the Rights
Agreement remains in effect:

         (i)      if the Holder exercises the Warrant before the Distribution
                  Date it will receive, in addition to the shares of Common
                  Stock issued on the exercise, one Right for each such share
                  of Common Stock;

         (ii)     if the Distribution Date occurs, the Rights that become
                  exercisable will be treated as having been issued for no
                  consideration as of the Distribution Date, and Rights issued

                                       7
<PAGE>
                  after the Distribution Date will be treated as having been
                  issued for no consideration as of their issue date and,
                  except as provided in Section 2.6(iv), an adjustment will be
                  made accordingly under Section 2.5 or, if applicable, Section
                  2.7 and Section 2.8;

         (iii)    no adjustment to the Exercise Price will be made under this
                  Section 2 for the issuance of Rights except as provided in
                  Section 2.6(ii); and

         (iv)     no adjustment will be made under this Section 2 for the
                  benefit of a Holder or any of its "Affiliates" or
                  "Associates" as defined in the Rights Agreement where that
                  Holder became an "Acquiring Person" under the Rights
                  Agreement and, as a result, caused the Rights to become
                  exercisable.

         2.7 Other Dilutive Securities. NATCO shall not (x) issue, sell or
grant equity securities (except Common Stock and Equity-Linked Securities) that
participate with shares of Common Stock in dividends, distributions or other
rights ("Other Dilutive Securities"), or (y) declare or pay dividends or
distributions (whether of evidences of indebtedness of NATCO, cash, assets or
securities) in respect of Other Dilutive Securities or Equity-Linked Securities
unless, in each case, this Section 2 is first amended to preserve without
dilution, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles
established in Section 2, the exercise rights of the Warrant.

         2.8 Other Dilutive Events. If any event occurs to which Section 2 does
not strictly apply but as to which the failure to make an adjustment would not
fairly protect the exercise rights with respect to the Warrant in accordance
with the essential intent and principles of Section 2, then NATCO shall appoint
a firm of independent certified public accountants of recognized national
standing to give their opinion on the adjustment needed to preserve without
dilution, on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles of
Section 2, the exercise rights of the Warrant. On receiving this opinion, NATCO
will promptly mail a copy of it to the Holder and shall make the adjustments
described in it.

         2.9 Valuation of Consideration and Non-Cash Distributions. If any of
the consideration received or to be received by NATCO in respect of shares of
Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities is in a form other than cash, or NATCO
or any other Person distributes assets (other than cash) or securities to
securityholders, the fair market value of such consideration, assets or
securities will be used in determining adjustments under this Section 2. The
fair market value shall be determined by the Board unless holders of a majority
of the interests under the Warrant (measured with respect to the number of
shares of Common Stock for which each holder can exercise its interest)

                                       8
<PAGE>
object to the Board's determination, in which case the Board shall retain an
independent appraiser reasonably satisfactory to those holders to determine the
fair market value. If the fair market value so determined by the independent
appraiser is more than 90% (in the case of non-cash consideration received or
to be received by NATCO) or is less than 110% (in the case of distributions of
non-cash assets or securities) of the fair market value determined by the
Board, the objecting holders shall pay the independent appraiser's fees and
expenses. When NATCO issues, sells or grants shares of Common Stock or
Equity-Linked Securities, the amount of consideration paid or payable to NATCO
in respect of such shares or securities and taken into account under this
Section 2 shall not include any amounts paid for accrued dividends or accrued
interest.

         2.10 Allocating Consideration. If shares of Common Stock or
Equity-Linked Securities are issued, sold or granted together with other stock
or securities or other assets of NATCO for an aggregate consideration that
covers both, the consideration paid or payable to NATCO for the shares of
Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities shall be the portion of the aggregate
consideration paid or payable to NATCO that may be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board to be allocable to such shares of Common Stock or
Equity-Linked Securities unless the holders of a majority of the interests
under the Warrant (measured with respect to the number of shares of Common
Stock for which each holder can exercise its interest) object to the Board's
determination, in which case the Board shall retain an independent appraiser
reasonably satisfactory to those holders to determine the allocation. If the
amounts allocated to the shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities as
determined by the independent appraiser do not differ by 10% or more from the
allocation determined by the Board, the objecting holders shall pay the
independent appraiser's fees and expenses.

         2.11 Notice of Adjustments. Calculations under this Section 2 shall be
made to the nearest four decimal points. NATCO shall notify the Holder promptly
after making any adjustment under this Section 2, and include reasonable detail
on the event requiring the adjustment and the calculation of the adjustment. On
a Holder's request at any time, NATCO shall promptly deliver to the Holder a
notice stating the then Exercise Price (and showing how it was calculated) and
the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount of any other stock,
securities, cash or other assets which would at that time be received on
exercising the Warrant.

         2.12 New York Stock Exchange Rules. No adjustment shall be made under
this Section 2 if the adjustment would constitute a material violation of the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other securities exchange on which
any of NATCO's securities are listed or admitted to trading.

         2.13 Adjustments to Other Shares. If, as a result of this Section 2,
the Holder on subsequent exercise becomes entitled to receive any shares of
capital stock of NATCO other than Common Stock, the number of shares so
receivable on exercise shall

                                       9
<PAGE>
be subject to adjustment on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to those
in this Section 2 and, to the extent appropriate, references to Common Stock in
other provisions of this Warrant shall be read as including those other shares
of capital stock.

         3. Stock Mergers; Change of Control.

         3.1 Changes to Warrant on a Stock Merger. If NATCO is party to a stock
merger or consolidation in which shares of Common Stock as constituted
immediately before the merger or consolidation are changed into or exchanged in
whole or in part for shares of common stock or similar ownership interests of
the surviving entity ("Stock Merger"), the terms of the Stock Merger shall
provide that, except to the extent that the Holder exercises its rights under
Section 3.3, the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive, on
exercising this Warrant and paying the Exercise Price, the shares of common
stock or similar ownership interests and other assets or consideration as may
be issued with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued if the Holder had exercised the Warrant in
whole immediately before the Stock Merger.

         3.2 Notice of Stock Merger. At least 15 days before the Stock Merger,
NATCO shall give the Holder notice of:

         (i)      the Stock Merger;

         (ii)     the terms of the Stock Merger (in reasonable detail); and

         (iii)    the Holder's rights under this Section 3 (which may be
                  satisfied by stating, in prominent type, that the Holder
                  should refer to Section 3 of the Warrant for a statement of
                  its rights in connection with the Stock Merger).

         3.3 Holder's Option to Exercise. NATCO shall, not fewer than 30 days
before the consummation of a transaction to which it is or will be a party that
will result in a Change of Control or within 15 days of becoming aware of the
occurrence of any other Change of Control, mail to the Holder a notice
notifying the Holder of the Change of Control, the circumstances and facts
surrounding the Change of Control, and the Holder's right to elect, within 15
days of receiving the notice, to exercise its rights to have NATCO repurchase
the Warrant under Section 3.3 if the Holder does not give notice to NATCO to
redeem any Convertible Preferred Shares it holds under section 11(b)(i) of the
Certificate of Designations. Within 15 days of receiving NATCO's notice, the
Holder may elect, instead of having the right thereafter to receive shares of
Common Stock, or of common stock or similar ownership interests and other
assets or consideration, to have NATCO repurchase the Warrant in whole or in
part, subject to the Holder not giving notice to NATCO to redeem any
Convertible Preferred Shares it holds

                                      10
<PAGE>
under section 11(b)(i) of the Certificate of Designations. To exercise this
election, the Holder shall give notice of its election to NATCO and surrender
the Warrant to NATCO at its principal office. The Holder is then entitled to
receive a repurchase price equal to (x) the Current Per Share Market Price on
the date of the Change of Control minus the Exercise Price that would have
applied if the Holder had exercised the Warrant under Section 1.1(a) on that
date multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock the Holder would
have acquired under Section 2.1 if it had exercised the Warrant on that date.
NATCO shall pay the repurchase price to the Holder, by wire transfer in
same-day funds to an account specified by the Holder, within two Business Days
after the end of the period during which holders of Convertible Preferred
Shares can give notice to NATCO under the Certificate of Designations to redeem
any of their Convertible Preferred Shares.

         4. NATCO's Right to Require the Holder to Exercise the Warrant.

         4.1 Notice Requiring the Holder to Exercise the Warrant. NATCO may
give the Holder notice to exercise the Warrant in whole but not in part if, on
the 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the day that NATCO gives the notice,
shares of Common Stock have a closing price (determined in accordance with the
definition of "closing price" within the definition of "Current Per Share
Market Price" in Section 15.1) of more than $13.50. This notice shall state the
Holder's rights and obligations under Section 4.2 (which may be satisfied by
stating, in prominent type, that the Holder has ten Trading Days in which to
exercise the Warrant and that the Holder should refer to Section 4.2 of the
Warrant for a statement of its rights in connection with the notice). The
amount of $13.50 shall be adjusted in the same manner as adjustments are made
to the Exercise Price under Section 2.

         4.2 Holder's Exercise. The Holder has ten Trading Days after the day
on which it actually receives NATCO's notice under Section 4.1 to elect to
exercise the Warrant in accordance with its terms. If the Holder has not
exercised the Warrant in whole by the end of this period, the Warrant shall
terminate. However, NATCO's notice under Section 4.1 shall have no effect if
shares of Common Stock have a closing price (determined in accordance with the
definition of "closing price" within the definition of "Current Per Share
Market Price" in Section 15.1) equal to or less than the Exercise Price at any
time from when the Holder actually receives the notice through 5.00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the second Trading Day after the day on which the Holder
actually receives the notice (unless the Holder has already exercised the
Warrant). For the purposes of determining when the Holder has actually received
a notice under this Section 4.2, the times of deemed receipt in Section 14.1(b)
do not apply.

         5. Liquidation, Dissolution, Winding Up. On NATCO's liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the Holder shall receive such cash or other assets
(minus the Exercise Price) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive
on the liquidation,

                                      11
<PAGE>
dissolution or winding up had the Warrant been exercised in whole and the
shares of Common Stock in respect of the exercise issued immediately before the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up.

         6. Registration Rights. If the Holder has signed, or has agreed in
writing to be bound by Purchaser's duties and obligations under, the
Registration Rights Agreement dated [Closing Date] between NATCO and Purchaser
(as amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement") all shares
of Common Stock issuable or issued on the exercise of the Warrant are subject
to and entitled to the benefits of the registration rights and other provisions
in the Registration Rights Agreement.

         7. Reservation of Stock, etc. NATCO shall reserve and keep available
out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of issuance on the exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable on exercise of this Warrant. On any increase in the
number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant could be exercisable,
NATCO shall take such steps as may be necessary to authorize, and shall
reserve, a sufficient number of additional shares of Common Stock to permit the
exercise in whole of this Warrant. Assuming the Holder pays the exercise price,
on exercise of any Warrant for shares of Common Stock issuable on exercising
the Warrant, those shares of Common Stock will be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, free of Liens, not issued in breach
of any preemptive rights and will have the voting and other rights of Common
Stock.

         8. Listing on Securities Exchanges. NATCO shall list on each national
securities exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market) on which Common Stock is at
any time listed, and shall maintain the listing of, all shares of Common Stock
from time to time issuable on exercising the Warrant, subject to official
notice of issuance on the exercise of the Warrant. NATCO shall also so list on
each national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, and shall
maintain the listing of, any other securities which the Holder is entitled to
receive on exercising the Warrant, if at the time any securities of the same
class as those other securities are listed on that national securities exchange
or the Nasdaq National Market, as the case may be.

         9. Notices of Corporate Actions. In the event of:

         (i)      NATCO taking a record of the holders of Common Stock or
                  Convertible Preferred Shares to determine the holders
                  entitled to a dividend or distribution, or any right to
                  acquire shares of Common Stock or Equity-Linked Securities,
                  or to receive any other right;

         (ii)     a subdivision, split or combination of outstanding shares of
                  Common Stock;

                                      12
<PAGE>
         (iii)    a consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification or
                  recapitalization involving NATCO, or a transfer of all or
                  substantially all of NATCO's assets;

         (iv)     NATCO's dissolution, liquidation or winding up; or

         (v)      any event not covered by paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
                  that would require an adjustment under Section 2,

NATCO shall give each Holder a notice, at least 15 days before the date of that
event, stating the date or expected date of that event and reasonable details
about that event (including reasonable details, insofar as they are known at
the time of giving the notice, about matters that will or may affect the
Exercise Price following that event and the securities or other assets
deliverable or purchasable in connection with that event or on exercise of the
Warrant following the event).

         10. Ownership, Transfer and Substitution of the Warrant.

         10.1 Ownership of Warrant. NATCO may treat the Person in whose name
the Warrant, or any warrant or warrants issued in substitution for it, is
registered on the register kept at NATCO's principal office as the owner and
the Holder for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
However, if a Warrant is properly assigned in blank, NATCO may (but is not
obligated to) treat the bearer as the owner of the Warrant for all purposes,
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. A Warrant, if properly assigned,
may be exercised by a new Holder without first having a substitute warrant
issued.

         10.2 Transfer and Exchange of the Warrant. On the Holder surrendering
the Warrant, properly endorsed, for registration of transfer or for exchange at
NATCO's principal office, together with in the case of transfer a form of
assignment in the form of Exhibit B duly executed by the Holder, NATCO at its
expense shall execute and deliver to or on the Holder's order a new and
equivalent warrant or warrants, in the Holder's name or as the Holder (on the
Holder paying any transfer taxes) directs, calling in the aggregate on the face
or faces for the number of shares of Common Stock called for on the face of the
surrendered Warrant.

         10.3 Replacing the Warrant. NATCO at its expense shall execute and
deliver a replacement Warrant promptly after receiving evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of the Warrant
and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction of the Warrant while
held by a Person other than the Purchaser, on receiving an indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to NATCO in form and amount (or, in the case of mutilation, on
receiving the Warrant for cancellation at NATCO's principal office).

                                      13

         11. No Rights or Liabilities as Shareholder. Nothing in the Warrant
confers on the Holder rights as a shareholder of NATCO or imposes liabilities
on the Holder to buy any securities of NATCO or as a shareholder of NATCO
(whether asserted by NATCO, by NATCO's creditors or shareholders or otherwise).

         12. Good Faith Actions.

         12.1 No Avoidance or Inconsistent Agreements. NATCO shall not avoid or
seek to avoid (including by amending its charter documents, or through a
consolidation, merger, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
transfer of assets, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or issue or sale or
securities) the performance of its obligations under this Warrant. NATCO shall
not enter into any agreement, arrangement or other transaction which is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holder in this Warrant.

         12.2 Required Actions. NATCO shall at all times in good faith assist
in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to protect the rights of the Holders against impairment (including the rights
to adjustments under Section 2), including obtaining the authorizations,
exemptions or consents of or from any governmental authority needed for NATCO
to perform its obligations or for the Holder to exercise its rights under this
Warrant.

         12.3 Stock Mergers and Other Transactions. NATCO will not consummate a
transaction described in Section 2.2(v) or a Stock Merger unless each Person
(except NATCO) required to deliver stock, securities, other ownership
interests, cash or other assets in connection with that transaction or Stock
Merger, assumes, by written instrument delivered to, and reasonably
satisfactory to, the Holder:

         (i)      NATCO's obligations under this Warrant (and, if NATCO
                  survives the consummation of the transaction or Stock Merger,
                  this assumption is in addition to, and does not release NATCO
                  from, NATCO's continuing obligations under this Warrant); and

         (ii)     the obligation to deliver to the Holder the shares of stock,
                  securities, other ownership interests, cash or other assets
                  the Holder is entitled to receive.

If the holders of a majority of the interests under the Warrant (measured with
respect to the number of shares of Common Stock for which each holder can
exercise its interest) requests, this instrument shall be accompanied by a
written opinion of counsel to each such Person, which opinion shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such holders, stating that such Person is obligated
to deliver to each Holder the shares of stock, securities, other ownership
interests, cash or other assets that the Holders are entitled to receive on the

                                      14
<PAGE>
exercise of the Warrant or otherwise in connection with the Stock Merger and
that the terms of this Warrant (including Section 2) will apply to such stock,
securities, other ownership interests, cash or other assets.

         13. Termination. This Warrant terminates automatically on the earliest
of:

         (i)      5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on [               ], 2006;

         (ii) the date on which the Warrant has been exercised in whole;

         (iii)    the date on which this Warrant terminates under Section 4.2;
                  and

         (iv)     the date on which the Holder gives notice to NATCO to redeem
                  its Convertible Preferred Shares under section 11(d) of the
                  Certificate of Designations in connection with a Change of
                  Control.

Section 14 shall survive termination. Termination shall not affect rights and
liabilities accrued before the termination date.

                  transmission receipt dated the day of transmission in the
                  recipient's jurisdiction: on the next Business Day after

         14.2 Amendments; Waivers, etc. No amendment of this Warrant, and no
waiver under it, shall be binding unless made in writing and duly signed by the
party against whom enforcement is sought. A waiver waives only the specific
matter described in the writing and does not impair the rights of the party
granting the waiver in other respects or at other times. A party's waiver of a
breach of or a default under this Warrant does not constitute a waiver of a
similar breach or default. A party's failure, on one or more occasions, to
enforce a provision of this Warrant, or to exercise a right or privilege under
this Warrant, does not constitute a waiver of that provision, right or
privilege.

         14.3 Specific Performance. NATCO acknowledges that irreparable damage
would occur if any of the provisions of this Warrant are not performed in
accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached. Therefore, the Holder is
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Warrant
and to specifically enforce its provisions in any court of the United States,
or any state of the United States, having jurisdiction (in addition to any
other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or equity).

         14.4 Severability. If any provision of this Warrant is inoperative or
unenforceable for any reason, this shall not make the provision inoperative or
unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or make any
other provision invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable.

         14.5 Governing Law. This Warrant is governed in all respects
(including as to validity, interpretation and effect) by the internal laws of
the state of New York without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules to
the extent those rules do not mandatorily apply by statute and would require or
permit the application of another jurisdiction's law.

         14.6 Jurisdiction. Each party:

         (i)      irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                  courts of the state of New York and the United States
                  District Court for the Southern District of New York in
                  respect of Litigation directly or indirectly arising out of
                  or relating to this Warrant (including as to validity,
                  interpretation and effect);

         (ii)     waives and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such
                  Litigation, that the Litigation may not be brought or is not

                                      17
<PAGE>
                  maintainable in those courts, that the venue is not
                  appropriate or that those courts cannot enforce this Warrant;
                  and

         (iii)    consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over that
                  party and over the subject matter of any such dispute and
                  agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that the
                  mailing of process or other papers in connection with the
                  Litigation in the manner provided in Section 14.1, or in such
                  other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and
                  sufficient service of that process or paper.

         14.7 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY DISPUTE
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS WARRANT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES. THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT HAS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS WARRANT (INCLUDING AS TO
VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT:

         (i)      NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
                  REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE OTHER PARTY
                  WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS
                  WAIVER;

         (ii)     IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
                  WAIVER;

         (iii)    IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND

         (iv)     IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
                  OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
                  SECTION 14.7.

         14.8 Successors and Assigns. NATCO's agreements in this Warrant other
than those applying solely to the Warrant and the Holder inure to the benefit
of and are enforceable by any holder or holders at the time of any shares of
Common Stock issued on exercising the Warrant, whether so expressed or not. The
Holder may assign some or all of its rights under this Warrant only in
accordance with section 4.1 of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated March
13, 2003 between NATCO and Purchaser. NATCO shall not assign any of its rights
and obligations under this Warrant without the Holder's prior consent.
Purported assignments in breach of this Section 14.8 shall be void.

                               the date in question. If the Current Per Share

                               Stock other than a regular quarterly cash
                               dividend or(y) any subdivision, split,
                               combination or reclassification of Common Stock

                               paid or that subdivision, split, combination or
                               reclassification is not consummated, the Current
                               Per Share Market Price shall be recalculated
