         WHEREAS, Comerica Incorporated has deemed it in the best interests of
the participants in the Corporation's Deferred 3 Year ROE Award Plan to amend

                                  ARTICLE III.
                      ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN.

         A. Completion of Irrevocable Election Form. An individual who wishes to
become a Participant in the Plan must complete and sign an Irrevocable Election
Form. Any Irrevocable Election Form received by the Committee or its delegate
shall become binding upon the Committee's acceptance thereof. In the Irrevocable
Election Form, the employee shall indicate the Incentive Award the Participant
wishes to defer. A Participant must file a separate Irrevocable Election Form
with respect to each year's Incentive Award he or she wishes to defer.

         B. Contents of Irrevocable Election Form. Each Irrevocable Election
Form shall: (i) designate the amount of the Incentive Award to be deferred in
whole percentages or in whole dollars; (ii) request that the Employer defer
payment of the Incentive Award to the Participant until the year the Participant
retires; (iii) state how the Participant wishes to receive payment of the
Incentive Award Deferrals at retirement; and (iv) contain other provisions the
Committee deems appropriate.

         C. Effect of Entering Into Irrevocable Election Form. Upon the
Committee's acceptance of a Participant's Irrevocable Election Form, the
Participant shall be (i) bound by the provisions of the Plan and by the
provisions of any agreement governing the Trust; (ii) bound by the provisions of
the Irrevocable Election Form; and (iii) deemed to have assumed the risks of
deferral, including, without limitation, the risk of poor investment performance
and the risk that Comerica Incorporated may become insolvent.










                                      III-1

<PAGE>

         D. Special Rules Applicable to Irrevocable Election Forms and Deferral
of The Incentive Award.

         (1) Deferral Election to be Made Before The Incentive Award is Earned.
In no event shall any of the Incentive Award which has been earned by a
Participant prior to the date such Participant's Irrevocable Election Form has
been accepted by the Committee be deferred under the Plan. Further, the
effective date of any Irrevocable Election Form shall not be earlier than the
first day of the calendar year which begins after the Irrevocable Election Form
is signed by the Participant and accepted by the Committee. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, an Irrevocable Election Form delivered to the Committee
within 60 days of the effective date of the Plan may defer the Incentive Award
to be earned in the remaining portion of the year in which it is delivered; and,
provided further, an Irrevocable Election Form delivered to the Committee within
30 days of the date an individual first becomes eligible to participate in the
Plan may defer the Incentive Award to be earned in the remaining portion of the
year in which it is delivered. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to
the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on
the percentage or dollar amount of any Participant election to defer the
Incentive Award and may impose rules prohibiting the deferral of less than 100%
of any award under any other incentive plan of the Employer that permits
deferral of awards thereunder.

         (2) Irrevocability of Deferral Election. Except as provided in Article
III(D)(3) and V(A)(4) below, the provisions of the Irrevocable Election Form
relating to a Participant's election to defer the Incentive Award and the
Participant's selection of the time and manner of payment of the Incentive Award
Deferrals shall be irrevocable.



                                      III-2
<PAGE>

         (3) Cancellation of Deferral Election. In the event of an Unforeseeable
Emergency, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit the Participant to
cancel an election to defer the Incentive Award, in whole or in part, and permit
the Participant to receive at the otherwise scheduled payment date whatever
portion of the amount subject to the deferral election is necessary, in the
judgment of the Committee, to alleviate the financial hardship occasioned by the
Unforeseeable Emergency.

         Any Participant who seeks to cancel a deferral election on account of
an Unforeseeable Emergency shall submit to the Committee a written request which
sets forth in reasonable detail the Unforeseeable Emergency, and the amount of
the Incentive Award Deferral which the Participant believes to be necessary to
remedy it. In determining whether to grant any Participant's request to cancel a
deferral election on the basis of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee
shall adhere to the requirements of Section 1.457-2(h)(4) of the Income Tax
Regulations, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. Any
Participant who is permitted to cancel a deferral election shall not again be
eligible to submit a deferral election until the calendar year following the
calendar year in which such cancellation is permitted.

         If a Participant receives a hardship distribution under the Comerica
Incorporated Preferred Savings Plan, the Participant's deferral election
hereunder shall be automatically canceled to the extent it would defer the
Participant's receipt of any Incentive Award the Participant would earn during a
twelve-month period beginning on the date of the Participant's receipt of such
hardship distribution. Any Participant whose deferral election is automatically
canceled in accordance with the provisions hereof shall not again be eligible to
submit a deferral election until the next enrollment period after the elapse of
at least 12 months following the Participant's receipt of a hardship
distribution.



                                      III-3
<PAGE>

         E. Deferrals By Committee. At its discretion, the Committee may defer
any of the Incentive Award payable to a Participant pursuant to a notice to the
Participant. Any of the Incentive Award payable to a Participant which is
deferred by the Committee shall be distributed to the Participant in shares of
Comerica Stock by either a lump sum distribution of Comerica Stock or
installments of Comerica Stock, upon his or her termination of employment. Any
Incentive Award deferred under the Plan by the Committee shall be invested in
the Comerica Stock Fund. Also, upon the death of the Participant on behalf of
whom the Incentive Award is deferred prior to distribution of all of the
Incentive Award deferred by the Committee and the earnings thereon, unless the
Participant has delivered a beneficiary designation form to the Committee with
respect to the sums deferred by the Committee, the balance will be distributed
to the Beneficiary(ies) listed on the most recent beneficiary designation form
delivered to the Committee with respect to any other Incentive Award deferred by
the Participant under the Plan. If the Participant has not designated a
Beneficiary(ies) with respect to sums deferred by the Committee and has not
deferred any other Incentive Award under the Plan (or submitted a beneficiary
designation form with respect to any such deferrals), the Incentive Award
deferred by the Committee and any earnings thereon shall be payable in the form
of Comerica Stock to the Participant's estate upon his or her death.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                        DEFERRED INCENTIVE AWARD ACCOUNTS
                   AND INVESTMENT OF DEFERRED INCENTIVE AWARD.

         A. Deferred Incentive Award Accounts. The Plan Administrator shall
establish a book reserve account in the name of each Participant. As soon as is
administratively feasible following the date the Incentive Award subject to a
Participant's deferral election would otherwise be paid to the Participant, the
Plan Administrator shall credit the Incentive Award being deferred to the
Participant's Account. Each Participant's Account shall further be credited with
earnings or charged with losses resulting from the deemed investment of the
Incentive Award Deferrals credited to the Account as though the Incentive Award
Deferrals had been invested in Comerica Stock, and shall be charged with any
distributions, any federal and state income tax withholdings, any social
security tax as may be required by law and by any further amounts, including
administrative fees and expenses, the Employer is either required to withhold or
determines are appropriate charges to such Participant's Account.

         B. Earnings on Incentive Award Deferrals. At the time a Participant
submits an Irrevocable Election Form, and from time to time thereafter at
intervals to be determined by the Committee, each Participant shall invest the
balance of his Account, any earnings and dividends thereon in Comerica Stock.

         Comerica Incorporated shall be under no obligation to acquire any
Comerica Stock to fund this Plan, and any investment actually made by the
Corporation with Incentive Award Deferrals will be acquired solely in the name
of Comerica Incorporated, and will remain the sole property of Comerica
Incorporated.










                                      IV-1

<PAGE>

         C. Contribution of Incentive Award Deferrals to Trust. In the sole
discretion of Comerica Incorporated, all or any portion of the Incentive Award
Deferrals credited to any Participant's Account may be contributed to a Trust
established by Comerica Incorporated in connection with the Plan. No Participant
or Beneficiary shall have the right to direct or require that Comerica
Incorporated contribute the Participant's Incentive Award Deferrals to the
Trust. Any Incentive Award Deferrals so contributed shall be held, invested and
administered to provide benefits under the Plan except as otherwise required in
the agreement governing the Trust.

         D. Insulation from Liability. No member of the Committee or officer,
employee or director of any Employer shall be liable to any person for any
action taken or omitted in connection with the administration of this Plan or
Trust unless attributable to such individual's own fraud or willful misconduct.

         E. Ownership of Incentive Award Deferrals. Title to and beneficial
ownership of any assets, of whatever nature, which may be allocated by Comerica
Incorporated to any Account in the name of any Participant shall at all times
remain with Comerica Incorporated, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have
any property interest whatsoever in any specific assets of Comerica Incorporated
by reason of the establishment of the Plan nor shall the rights of any
Participant or Beneficiary to payments under the Plan be increased by reason of
Comerica Incorporated's contribution of Incentive Award Deferrals to the Trust.
The rights of each Participant and Beneficiary hereunder shall be limited to
enforcing the unfunded, unsecured promise of the Participant's Employer to pay
benefits under the Plan, and the status of any Participant or Beneficiary shall
be that of an unsecured general creditor of Comerica Incorporated. Participants
and Beneficiaries shall



                                      IV-2
<PAGE>

not be deemed to be parties to any trust agreement Comerica Incorporated enters
into with the Trustee.

         F. [Intentionally left blank]

         G. Adjustment of Accounts Upon Changes In Capitalization. In the event
the number of outstanding shares of Comerica Stock changes as a result of any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
reorganization, combination, or exchange of shares, split-up, spin-off,
liquidation or other similar change in capitalization, or any distribution made
to common stockholders other than cash dividends, the number or kind of shares
of Comerica Stock in which such Accounts are deemed to be invested shall be
automatically adjusted, and the Committee shall be authorized to make such other
equitable adjustment of any Account, so that the value of the Account shall not
be decreased by reason of the occurrence of such event. Any such adjustment

                                   ARTICLE V.
                   DISTRIBUTION OF INCENTIVE AWARD DEFERRALS.

         A. In General. The benefits payable hereunder as Deferred Incentive
Award shall be paid to the Participant or to the Participant's Beneficiary as
follows:

         (1) Employment Through Deferral Period. If the Participant's employment
with an Employer continues until the last day of the Deferral Period, Comerica
Incorporated shall, as soon as administratively feasible following the end of
the Deferral Period, distribute, or commence to distribute, the balance of the
Account in the name of the Participant in Comerica Stock, in any manner
described below which is selected by the Participant in the Participant's
Irrevocable Election Form: (i) a single sum; (ii) annual installments over 5
years, (iii) annual installments over 10 years; or (iv) annual installments over
15 years.

         (2) Termination Prior to End of Deferral Period. If the Participant's
employment with the Employer terminates prior to the last day of the Deferral
Period (unless such termination is due to the Participant's Disability), then
notwithstanding the manner of distribution selected by the Participant, Comerica
Incorporated shall distribute or direct the Trustee to distribute Comerica Stock
to the Participant as of the earliest convenient date, as determined by the
Committee, which occurs subsequent to the date the Participant's employment
terminates. Such shares shall be distributed to the Participant or to the
Participant's Beneficiary in a single distribution as soon as is
administratively feasible following the Participant's termination date.


         If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the last day of the
Deferral Period because the Participant has become Disabled, then
notwithstanding the distribution date



                                       V-1

selected by the Participant in the Participant's Irrevocable Election Form,
certificates evidencing the Comerica Stock Fund investment, shall be
distributed, or commence to be distributed, as soon as administratively feasible
following his or her termination date, such distribution to be made in the
manner specified in the Participant's Irrevocable Election Form.

         (3) Death of Participant Prior to End of Installment Distribution
Period. If the Participant dies before a distribution of all the Comerica Stock
is made, then the remaining Comerica Stock certificates shall be distributed to
the Participant's Beneficiary, such distribution to be made as soon as is
administratively feasible following the date of the Participant's death.

         (4) Hardship Distributions. In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency
involving a Participant which occurs prior to distribution of the entire balance
of the Account in the name of the Participant, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, make a single distribution of Comerica Stock, to the Participant in
an amount equal to such portion of the Account in the Participant's name as
shall be necessary in the judgment of the Committee to alleviate the financial
hardship occasioned by the Unforeseeable Emergency. Any Participant desiring a
distribution under the Plan on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall
submit to the Committee a written request for such distribution which sets forth
in reasonable detail the Unforeseeable Emergency which would cause the
Participant severe financial hardship, and the number of Comerica Stock
certificates, which the Participant believes to be necessary to alleviate the
financial hardship. In determining whether to grant any requested hardship
distribution, the Committee shall adhere to the requirements of the Income Tax
Regulations referred to in Article III(D)(3) hereof.



                                       V-2

         (5) Stock Certificate Distributions. If, at the time an installment
distribution of an Account in the name of any Participant is scheduled to
commence, the fair market value of such Account does not exceed $5,000 then,
notwithstanding an election by the Participant that such Account be distributed
in installments, the balance of Comerica Stock in such Account shall be
distributed to the Participant in a single distribution on or about the date the
first installment is scheduled to be made.

         B. Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant shall deliver to the
Committee a written designation of Beneficiary(ies) under the Plan, which
designation may from time to time be amended or revoked without notice to, or
consent of, any previously designated Beneficiary.

         (1) Beneficiary Designation Must be Filed Prior to Participant's Death.
No designation of Beneficiary, and no amendment or revocation thereof, shall
become effective if delivered to the Committee after such Participant's death,
unless the Committee shall determine such designation, amendment or revocation
to be valid.

         (2) Absence of Beneficiary. In the absence of an effective designation
of Beneficiary, or if no Beneficiary designated shall survive the Participant,
then the balance of the Account in the name of the Participant shall be paid to
the Participant's estate.

                            AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.

         A. Amendment and Termination of Plan. This Plan may be amended or
terminated at any time in the sole discretion of the Committee by a written
instrument executed by the Committee. No such amendment shall affect the time of
distribution of any of the Incentive Award earned prior to the time of such
amendment or termination except as the Committee may determine to be necessary
to carry out the purpose of the Plan.

         Written notice of any such amendment or termination shall be given to
each Participant. Upon termination of the Plan, Comerica Incorporated shall
distribute to each Participant or Beneficiary, or direct that the Trustee so
distribute, the amounts which would have been distributed to such Participant or
Beneficiary under the Plan had the Participant's employment with an Employer
terminated at the time of termination of the Plan. In addition, no such
amendment shall make the Trust revocable.

         A. Nonforfeitability of Participant Accounts. Each Participant shall be
fully vested in his or her Account.

         B. Prohibition Against Assignment. Benefits payable to Participants and
their Beneficiaries under the Plan may not be anticipated, assigned (either at
law or in equity), alienated, sold, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any
manner, nor may they be subjected to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or
other legal or equitable process for the debts, contracts, liabilities,
engagements or acts of any Participant or Beneficiary.

         C. No Employment Contract. Nothing in the Plan is intended to be
construed, or shall be construed, as constituting an employment contract between
the Employer and any Participant nor shall any Plan provision affect the
Employer's right to discharge any Participant for any reason or for no reason.

         D. Successors Bound. The contractual agreement between Comerica
Incorporated and each Participant resulting from the execution of an Irrevocable
Election Form shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Comerica
Incorporated, its successors and assigns, and to the Participant and to the
Participant's heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives.

Incentive Award Deferrals from Comerica Incorporated nor utilize his or her
Account as security for any loan from the Employer.

the Plan shall be vested in the Committee. To the extent permitted by law, the
Committee may delegate any authority it possesses to the Plan Administrator(s).
To the extent the

<PAGE>

Committee has delegated authority concerning a matter to the Plan
Administrator(s), any reference in the Plan to the "Committee" insofar as it
pertains to such matter, shall refer likewise to the Plan Administrator(s).

         G. Governing Law and Rules of Construction. This Plan shall be governed
in all respects, whether as to construction, validity or otherwise, by
applicable federal law and, to the extent that federal law is inapplicable, by
the laws of the State of Michigan. Each provision of this Plan shall be treated
as severable, to the end that, if any one or more provisions shall be adjudged
or declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this Plan shall be interpreted,
and shall remain in full force and effect, as though such provision or
provisions had never been contained herein. It is the intention of Comerica
Incorporated that the Plan established hereunder be "unfunded" for income tax
purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA, and the provisions hereof shall
be construed in a manner to carry out that intention.

         H. Power to Interpret. This Plan shall be interpreted and effectuated
to comply with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable tax law principles; and all such applicable requirements are hereby
incorporated herein by reference. Subject to the above, the Committee shall have
power to construe and interpret this Plan, including but not limited to all
provisions of this Plan relating to eligibility for benefits and the amount,
manner and time of payment of benefits, any such construction and interpretation
by the Committee and any action taken thereon in good faith by the Plan
Administrator(s) to be final and conclusive upon any affected party. The
Committee shall also have power to correct any defect, supply any omission, or
reconcile any inconsistency in such manner and to such extent as the Committee
shall deem proper to carry out and put into effect this Plan; and any
construction made or other action taken by the Committee

shall be September 2001, except as otherwise expressly stated herein.
