2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1. Purpose. The purpose of this 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (this
&#147;Plan&#148;) is to provide a means whereby XO Communications, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;)
or any parent or subsidiary of the Company, as defined in Subsection 5.8 (the
&#147;related entities&#148;), may continue to attract, motivate and retain selected
employees, officers and independent contractors who can materially contribute
to the Company&#146;s growth and success, and to encourage stock ownership in the
Company through the grant of (i)&nbsp;incentive stock options, (ii)&nbsp;nonqualified
stock options and (iii)&nbsp;shares of restricted stock (or any combination thereof)
(each, an &#147;award&#148;) with respect to the Common Stock of the Company (as defined
in Section&nbsp;3), so that such key employees and other persons and entities will
more closely identify their interests with those of the Company and its
stockholders.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2. Administration. This Plan shall be administered by the
Compensation Committee (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors
of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;), unless (a)&nbsp;the Board shall resolve to administer
this Plan itself or shall not have appointed, or revoked the appointment of,
the Compensation Committee, in which case the Board shall administer the Plan
or (b)&nbsp;the Board shall appoint or authorize another committee of the Board to
administer this Plan, in which case such committee shall administer the Plan.
The administrator of this Plan shall hereinafter be referred to as the &#147;Plan
Administrator.&#148;
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Procedures. The Board may designate one of the members of the Plan
Administrator as chairperson. The Plan Administrator may hold meetings at such
times and places as it shall determine. The acts of a majority of the members
of the Plan Administrator present at meetings at which a quorum exists, or acts
reduced to or approved in writing by all Plan Administrator members, shall be
valid acts of the Plan Administrator.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. Responsibilities. Except for the terms and conditions explicitly
required in this Plan, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, in its
discretion, to determine all matters relating to the awards to be granted under
this Plan, including selection of the individuals to be granted awards, the
number of shares to be subject to each award, the exercise price, and all other
terms and conditions of the awards. Grants under this Plan need not be
identical in any respect, even when made simultaneously. The interpretation
and construction by the Plan Administrator of any terms or provisions of this
Plan or any award issued under this Plan, or of any rule or regulation
promulgated in connection with this Plan, shall be conclusive and binding on
all interested parties, so long as such interpretation and construction with
respect to incentive stock options correspond to the requirements of Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;), as amended, and the regulations
thereunder.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. Section&nbsp;16(b) Compliance and Bifurcation of Plan. It is the
intention of the Company that this Plan, and awards granted under this Plan,
comply in all respects with Rule

<P><FONT size="2">16b-3 under the Exchange Act and, if any Plan provision is later found not
to be in compliance with such Section, the provision shall be deemed null and
void, and in all events this Plan shall be construed in favor of its meeting
the requirements of Rule&nbsp;16b-3. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the
contrary, the Board, in its absolute discretion, may bifurcate this Plan so as
to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of this Plan to
participants who are officers and directors subject to Section&nbsp;16(b) of the
Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning other Plan
participants.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 3. Stock Subject to This Plan. The stock subject to this Plan
shall be the Company&#146;s Common Stock (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;), authorized but
unissued or held or subsequently acquired by the Company as treasury shares.
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;7 of this Plan, the aggregate
amount of Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to all awards granted under
this Plan shall not exceed 17,590,020 shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Plan
Maximum&#148;). If any award granted under this Plan expires or is surrendered,
canceled, terminated or exchanged for another award for any reason without
having vested or having been exercised in full, as applicable, the
undistributed shares subject to such expired, surrendered, canceled, terminated
or exchanged award shall again be available for purposes of this Plan,
including use as replacement awards that may be granted in exchange for such
surrendered, canceled or terminated awards.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4. Eligibility. An incentive stock option may be granted only to
an individual who, at the time the option is granted, is an employee of the
Company (or a corporate related entity, as described in Section&nbsp;5.8) and who
the Plan Administrator may from time to time select for participation in this
Plan. Members of the Board shall not be eligible for grants of incentive stock
options unless they are also employees of the Company. At the discretion of
the Plan Administrator, employees and independent contractors of the Company
(including nonemployee directors) or any related entity may receive awards of
nonqualified stock options and restricted stock. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect
to which options may be granted to any individual in any calendar year shall
not exceed the Plan Maximum, as such number may change from time to time. Any
party to whom an option is granted under this Plan shall be referred to in this
Plan as an &#147;Optionee.&#148; Any party to whom an award of restricted stock is
granted under this Plan shall be referred to in this Plan as a &#147;Holder&#148;.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 5. Terms and Conditions of Options. Options granted under this
Plan shall be evidenced by written agreements that contain such terms,
conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Plan Administrator shall deem
advisable and which are not inconsistent with this Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, options shall include or incorporate by reference the following
terms and conditions:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1. Number of Shares. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased
pursuant to the exercise of each option shall be as established by the Plan
Administrator.

exercisable (the &#147;exercise price&#148;) shall be as established by the Plan
Administrator, provided that the Plan Administrator shall act in good faith to
establish the exercise price as follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2.1. Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options. With
respect to incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;422 of the
Code, and subject to Subsection 5.2.2 below, the per share exercise price shall
be not less than the fair market value of one share of the Common Stock at the
time the option is granted, except with respect to the substitution of a new
option for an old option, or an assumption of an old option, in accordance with
Code Section&nbsp;424(a). With respect to nonqualified stock options, the exercise
price shall be the amount set by the Plan Administrator; provided, however,
that the exercise price of the nonqualified stock options to be granted on or
following the Company&#146;s reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
presided over by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of New York (the &#147;Plan of Reorganization&#148;) covering 12,199,820 shares of Common
Stock (the &#147;Bankruptcy Options&#148;) shall have an exercise price no less than that
allowed under the Plan of Reorganization, based upon the post-rights offering
equity value ($475&nbsp;million plus the amount subscribed to in the rights
offering) of the Company assumed in connection with the Plan of Reorganization.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the degree that any of the Bankruptcy
Options are forfeited, such that the underlying shares are again available for
issuance pursuant to awards under the Plan, the exercise price for any future
nonqualified stock options relating to such forfeited shares shall be the
amount set by the Plan Administrator without the price limitation set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence.

respect to incentive stock options granted to greater than 10% shareholders of
the Company, the exercise price shall be as required by Section&nbsp;6.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2.3. Fair Market Value. The fair market value per share of the Common
Stock for the purpose of determining the exercise price under this Section&nbsp;5.2
shall be determined as follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;if the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange or a
national market system including without limitation the National Market System
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation
(&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) System, the fair market value shall be the closing sales price for
such stock (or the closing bid, if no sales were reported), as quoted on such
system or exchange for the last market trading date prior to the time of
determination as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other source as
the Plan Administrator deems reliable;
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;if the Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not on the
National Market System thereof) or regularly quoted by a recognized securities
dealer but selling prices are not reported, the fair market value shall be the
mean between the high and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the last
market trading date prior to the day of determination, as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or such other source as the Plan

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3. Term, Maturity and Exercisability. Subject to the restrictions
contained in Section&nbsp;6 with respect to granting incentive stock options to
greater than 10% shareholders of the Company, the term of each stock option
shall be 10&nbsp;years from the date it is granted unless a shorter period of time
is established by the Plan Administrator, but in no event shall the term of any
incentive stock option exceed 10&nbsp;years. Options shall have such vesting and
exercisability conditions as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator, in
its sole discretion, and set forth in the written agreement evidencing such
subsequent grant.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4. Exercise. Subject to the vesting schedule as determined by the Plan
Administrator, if any, and to any additional holding period required by
applicable law, each option may be exercised in whole or in part; provided,
however, that only whole shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of any
option. During an Optionee&#146;s lifetime, any stock options granted under this
Plan are personal to him or her and are exercisable solely by such Optionee,
except as provided in Section&nbsp;5.7. Options shall be exercised by delivery to
the Company of notice of the number of shares with respect to which the option
is exercised, together with payment of the exercise price.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5. Payment of Exercise Price. Payment of the option exercise price
shall be made in full at the time the notice of exercise of the option is
delivered to the Company and shall be in cash, bank certified or cashier&#146;s
check or personal check (unless at the time of exercise the Plan Administrator
in a particular case determines not to accept a personal check) for the Common
Stock being purchased.

incentive stock options, or at any time before exercise for nonqualified stock
options, that additional forms of payment will be permitted, including
installment payments on such terms and over such period as the Plan
Administrator may determine in its discretion. To the extent permitted by the
Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, and if permitted by applicable laws
and regulations (including, but not limited to, federal tax and securities laws
and regulations and state corporate law), an option may be exercised by:

a rate specified by the Plan Administrator but in no case

granted or at any time prior to exercise of a nonqualified stock option; (iii)
the Plan Administrator may require that the Optionee pledge the Optionee&#146;s
shares to the Company for the purpose of securing the payment of such note and
may require that the certificate representing such shares be held in escrow in
order to perfect the Company&#146;s security interest; (iv)&nbsp;the note provides that
90&nbsp;days following the Optionee&#146;s termination of employment with the Company or
a related entity, the entire outstanding balance under the note shall become

irrevocable instructions to a broker, all in accordance with the regulations of
the Federal Reserve Board, to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of
sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price and any federal, state or local
withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the exercise;
provided, that the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may at any time
determine that this Subparagraph (c), to the extent the instructions to the
broker call for an immediate sale of the shares, shall not be applicable to any
Optionee who is subject to Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act if such
transaction would result in a violation of Section&nbsp;16(b), or is not an employee
at the time of exercise.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6. Withholding Tax Requirement. The Company or any related entity shall
have the right to retain and withhold from any payment of cash or Common Stock
under this Plan the amount of taxes required by any government to be withheld
or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to such payment. At its
discretion, the Company may require an Optionee receiving shares of Common
Stock to reimburse the Company or a related entity for any such taxes required
to be withheld and may withhold any distribution in whole or in part until the
Company, or related entity, is so reimbursed. In lieu of such withholding or
reimbursement, the Company (or related entity) shall have the right to withhold
from any other cash amounts due or to become due from the Company (or related
entity) to the Optionee an amount equal to such taxes or to retain and withhold
a number of shares having a market value not less than the amount of such taxes
required to be withheld as reimbursement for any such taxes and cancel or sell
(in whole or in part) any such shares so withheld on Optionee&#146;s behalf.
Alternatively, the Committee may, pursuant to certain procedures that it may
establish from time to time, allow the Optionee to elect to have a number of
shares, having a market value not less than the amount of such taxes required
to be withheld, withheld and delivered to a broker to be sold into the market
on the Optionee&#146;s behalf with the proceeds being returned to the Company to
reimburse the Company for payment of such taxes.

the rights and privileges conferred by this Plan may not be transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any manner (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) other than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and
distribution; provided, with respect to a non-qualified stock

<P><FONT size="2">option, an Optionee may transfer the option to a revocable trust created
by the Optionee for the benefit of his or her descendants, to an immediate
family member or to a partnership in which only immediate family members or
such trusts are partners. Options under this Plan shall not be subject to
execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer, assign,
pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any option under this Plan or of
any right or privilege conferred by this Plan, contrary to the Code or to the
provisions of this Plan, or the sale or levy or any attachment or similar
process upon the rights and privileges conferred by this Plan shall be null and
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Optionee may during the Optionee&#146;s
lifetime, designate a person who may exercise the option after the Optionee&#146;s
death by giving written notice of such designation to the Plan Administrator.
Such designation may be changed from time to time by the Optionee by giving
written notice to the Plan Administrator revoking any earlier designation and
making a new designation.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.8. Termination of Relationship. If the Optionee&#146;s employment
relationship with the Company or any related entity ceases for any reason other
than termination for cause, death or permanent and total disability, and unless
by its terms the option sooner terminates or expires, then the Optionee may
exercise, for a period of three months after such cessation, that portion of
the Optionee&#146;s option which is exercisable at the time of such cessation. The
Optionee&#146;s option, however, shall terminate at the end of the three month
period following such cessation as to all shares of Common Stock that have not
been exercised, unless such provision is waived in the agreement evidencing the
option or by resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator. If, in the case of
an incentive stock option, an Optionee&#146;s relationship with the Company or
related entity changes (i.e., from employee to nonemployee, such as a
consultant), such change shall constitute a termination of an Optionee&#146;s
employment with the Company or related entity and the Optionee&#146;s incentive
stock option shall terminate in accordance with this subsection. Upon the
expiration of the three month period following cessation of employment, the
Plan Administrator shall have sole discretion in a particular circumstance to
extend the exercise period following such cessation beyond that specified
above. If, however, in the case of an incentive stock option, the Optionee
does not exercise the Optionee&#146;s option within three months after cessation of
employment, the option will no longer qualify as an incentive stock option
under the Code.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an Optionee&#146;s termination of employment for cause, all of the
optionee&#146;s outstanding (i.e., unexercised) options issued under this Plan shall
immediately expire and no longer be available for exercise. For purposes of
this Section&nbsp;5.8, &#147;cause&#148; means the Company or a related entity having cause to
terminate an Optionee&#146;s employment or service under any existing employment,
consulting or any other agreement between the Optionee and the Company or
related entity. In the absence of any such an employment, consulting or other
agreement &#147;cause&#148; shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection 8.1.4
herein.

ceases because of a permanent and total disability, the Optionee&#146;s option shall
not terminate upon such Optionee&#146;s cessation of employment but rather shall
expire at the end of the 12-month period following such cessation (unless by
its terms it sooner terminates and expires). In the event of

<P><FONT size="2">such permanent and total disability any incentive stock option held by the
Optionee shall continue to be treated as an incentive stock option until its
expiration. As used in this Plan, the term &#147;permanent and total disability&#148;
has the same meaning provided in Code Section&nbsp;22(e)(3).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this subsection 5.8, a transfer of relationship between or
among the Company and/or any related entity shall not be deemed to constitute a
cessation of relationship with the Company or any of its related entities. For
purposes of this subsection 5.8, with respect to incentive stock options,
employment shall be deemed to continue while the Optionee is on military leave,
sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence (as determined by the Plan
Administrator). The foregoing notwithstanding, employment shall not be deemed
to continue beyond the first 90&nbsp;days of such leave, unless the Optionee&#146;s
reemployment rights are guaranteed by statute or by contract.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Plan, the term &#147;related entity,&#148; when referring to a
subsidiary, shall mean any business entity (other than the Company) which, at
the time of the granting of the option, is in an unbroken chain of entities
ending with the Company, if stock or voting interests possessing 50% or more of
the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or other ownership
interests of each of the entities other than the Company is owned by one of the
other entities in such chain. When referring to a parent entity, the term
&#147;related entity&#148; shall mean any entity in an unbroken chain of entities ending
with the Company if, at the time of the granting of the option, each of the
entities other than the Company owns stock or other ownership interests
possessing 50% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock (or other ownership interests) in one of the other entities in such
chain. In addition, with respect to an incentive stock option, the definition
of &#147;related entity&#148; as used in this Plan shall apply by only considering
entities that are corporations.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9. Death of Optionee. If an Optionee dies while he or she has a
relationship with the Company or any related entity or dies within the three
month period (or 12-month period in the case of totally disabled Optionees)
following cessation of such relationship, any option held by such Optionee to
the extent that the Optionee would have been entitled to exercise such option,
may be exercised within one year after his or her death by the personal
representative of his or her estate or by the person or persons to whom the
Optionee&#146;s rights under the option shall pass by will or by the applicable laws
of descent and distribution.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.10. Status of Shareholder. Neither the Optionee nor any party to which
the Optionee&#146;s rights and privileges under the option may pass shall be, or
have any of the rights or privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with
respect to any of the shares issuable upon the exercise of any option granted
under this Plan unless and until such option has been exercised.

of Code Section&nbsp;422 with respect to incentive stock options and to the terms
and conditions and within the limitations of this Plan, the Plan Administrator
may modify or amend outstanding options granted under this Plan. The
modification or amendment of an outstanding option shall not, without the
consent of the Optionee, impair or diminish any of his or her rights or any of
the

provided in this Plan, no outstanding option shall be terminated without the
consent of the Optionee. Unless the Optionee agrees otherwise, any changes or
adjustments made to outstanding incentive stock options granted under this Plan
shall be made in such a manner so as not to constitute a &#147;modification&#148; as
defined in Code Section&nbsp;424(h) and so as not to cause any incentive stock
option issued hereunder to fail to continue to qualify as an incentive stock
option as defined in Code Section&nbsp;422(b).

of restricted stock to eligible individuals hereunder, (2)&nbsp;to issue or transfer
restricted stock to such individual, and (3)&nbsp;to establish terms, conditions and
restrictions applicable to such restricted stock, including the restricted

the Company an award agreement with respect to the restricted stock setting
forth the restrictions applicable to such restricted stock. If the Plan
Administrator determines that the restricted stock shall be held in escrow
rather than delivered to the Holder pending the release of the applicable
restrictions, the Holder additionally shall execute and deliver to the Company
(i)&nbsp;an escrow agreement satisfactory to the Plan Administrator, and (ii)&nbsp;the
appropriate blank stock powers with respect to the restricted stock covered by
such agreements. If a Holder shall fail to execute a restricted stock
agreement and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and stock powers, the award
shall be null and void. Unless otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator
and subject to the restrictions set forth in Section&nbsp;7.2, the Holder shall
generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such restricted
stock, including the right to vote such restricted stock. At the discretion of
the Plan Administrator, cash dividends and stock dividends, if any, with
respect to the restricted stock may be either currently paid to the Holder or
withheld by the Company for the Holder&#146;s account. Unless otherwise determined
by the Plan Administrator, no interest will accrue or be paid on the amount of
any cash dividends withheld. Unless otherwise determined by the Plan
Administrator, cash dividends or stock dividends so withheld by the Plan
Administrator shall be subject to forfeiture to the same degree as the shares
of restricted stock to which they relate.

cause a stock certificate registered in the name of the Holder to be issued
and, if it so determines, deposited together with the stock powers with an

amount of taxes required by any government to be withheld or otherwise deducted
and paid by the Company with respect to such distribution and cancel (in whole
or in part) any such shares so withheld on Holder&#146;s behalf. At its discretion,
the Company may require a Holder receiving shares of Common Stock to reimburse
the Company or a related entity for any such taxes required to be paid and may
suspend any distribution in whole or in part until the Company, or related
entity, is so reimbursed. In lieu of such withholding or reimbursement, the
Company (or related entity) shall have the right to withhold from any other
cash amounts due or to become due from the Company (or related entity) to the
Holder an amount equal to such taxes. Moreover, the Company, in its sole
discretion, may cancel and cause the complete forfeiture of any award hereunder
with respect to which the recipient does not reimburse the Company, within a
reasonable period of time (as determined by the Company), for any taxes
required to be paid by the Company to any such government. To the extent the
Company chooses to cancel any award for the failure to timely reimburse the
Company for any taxes required to be paid by the Company, such award and any
dividends or other attributes associated therewith shall be fully forfeited to
the Company and the recipient shall have no further rights or interest in such
award. Alternatively, the Committee may, pursuant to certain procedures that it
may establish from time to time, allow the Holder to elect to have a number of
shares, having a market value not less than the amount of such taxes required
to be withheld, withheld and delivered to a broker to be sold into the market
on the Holder&#146;s behalf with the proceeds being returned to the Company to
reimburse the Company for payment of such taxes.

Stock, in their sole discretion, determine that any or all such options or
restricted stock granted under this Plan shall not be converted into options to
purchase or rights to acquire shares of Exchange Stock, but instead shall
terminate in accordance with the provisions of subsection 8.1.1. The amount and
price of converted options and the number of shares of restricted stock subject
