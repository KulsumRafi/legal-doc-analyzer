<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Indemnification Agreement, dated as
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Agreement</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), is
made by and between ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP,&nbsp;INC., a Delaware corporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Company</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"),
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Indemnitee</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnitee
is a director and/or officer of the Company and his/her willingness to serve in such capacity is predicated, in substantial part, upon the Company's willingness to indemnify
him/her to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state of Delaware, and upon the other undertakings set forth in this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,
in recognition of the need to provide Indemnitee with substantial protection against personal liability, in order to procure Indemnitee's continued service as a director
and/or officer of the Company and to enhance Indemnitee's ability to serve the Company in an effective manner, and in order to provide such protection pursuant to express contract rights (intended to
be enforceable irrespective of, among other things, any amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Constituent
Documents</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Board</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") or any
change-in-control or business combination transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancement
of Expenses (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(c)) to Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement and for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
light of the considerations referred to in the preceding recitals, it is the Company's intention and desire that the provisions of this Agreement be construed liberally, subject to
their express terms, to maximize the protections to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder. </FONT></P>

reasonably evidencing that Indemnitee has incurred such Expenses or, if such Expenses have not yet been incurred, a reasonably detailed estimate of such Expenses and an undertaking to provide such
documentation once the estimated Expenses have been incurred. Within twenty days after any such request properly made by Indemnitee, the Company shall, in accordance with such request (but without
duplication), (a)&nbsp;pay such Expenses on behalf of Indemnitee, (b)&nbsp;advance to Indemnitee funds in an amount sufficient to pay such Expenses, or (c)&nbsp;reimburse Indemnitee for such

later than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Claim, Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve it from any liability under this Agreement
except to the extent, if any, that such omission actually prejudices the use by the Company of defenses, rights or insurance coverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
obtain indemnification under this Agreement in respect of an Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request
therefor including a reasonable description (based upon information then available to Indemnitee) of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss and the basis for the assertion of a claim under
this Agreement. If, at the time of the receipt of such request, the Company has directors' and officers' liability insurance in effect under which coverage for such Indemnifiable Claim or
Indemnifiable Loss is potentially available, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss to the applicable insurers in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall provide to Indemnitee a copy of such notice delivered to the applicable insurers, and copies of all subsequent correspondence between the
Company and such insurers regarding the Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, in each case substantially concurrently with the delivery or receipt thereof by the Company. The failure by
Indemnitee to timely notify the Company of any Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, such failure
actually prejudices the use by the Company of defenses, rights or insurance coverage. </FONT></P>

the extent that Indemnitee shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Indemnifiable Claim, or in defense of any issue or matter therein,
Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim or issue or matter in accordance with Section&nbsp;2 and no
Standard of Conduct Determination (as defined in Section&nbsp;7(b)) shall be required. </FONT></P>

Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Standard of Conduct Determination</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shall be made as follows:
(i)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, (ii)&nbsp;if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by a majority vote of a committee of
Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of all Disinterested Directors, or (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such Disinterested Directors or if requested by Indemnitee, by Independent Counsel
in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. Indemnitee will cooperate with the person or persons making such Standard of Conduct Determination,
including providing to such person or persons, upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably
available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Standard of Conduct Determination required under Section&nbsp;7(b) to be made as promptly as practicable
and in no event later than 45&nbsp;days after the Notification Date; provided that such 45&nbsp;day period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed an additional 30&nbsp;days if the
person or persons making such determination in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluation or documentation and/or information relating thereto If any such Standard of
Conduct Determination is not made within such 45 (or 75)&nbsp;day period, Indemnitee shall be permitted to petition the Delaware Court of Chancery to make such determination. </FONT></P>

Directors, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. Indemnitee may, within five business days after receiving
written notice of selection from the Company, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that such objection may be
asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not satisfy the criteria set forth in the
definition of "Independent Counsel" in Section&nbsp;1(g), and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and
timely objection, the person or firm so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is properly and timely made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not
serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If no Independent Counsel that is permitted under the
foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;7(e) to make the Standard of Conduct Determination shall have been selected within 30&nbsp;days after the Company gives its initial notice pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section&nbsp;7(e) either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by
the Indemnitee to the Company's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall
designate, and the person or firm with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person or firm so appointed will act as Independent Counsel. In all events, the Company shall pay all of

(including by its directors or any Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not satisfied any applicable standard of conduct shall be a defense to any Claim by Indemnitee for indemnification or

the Company, and thereafter for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any pending or possible Indemnifiable Claim, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the
scope and amount of coverage available relative to the cost thereof) to cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage for Indemnitee of
the Company that is at least substantially comparable in scope and amount to that provided by the Company's
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance. Upon request, the Company shall provide Indemnitee with a copy of all directors' and officers' liability insurance applications,
binders, policies, declarations, endorsements and other related materials, and shall provide Indemnitee with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same. Without limiting the generality
or effect of the two immediately preceding sentences, the Company shall not discontinue or significantly reduce the scope or amount of coverage from one policy period to the next policy period
(i)&nbsp;without the prior approval thereof by a majority vote of the Incumbent Directors, even if less than a quorum, or (ii)&nbsp;if at the time that any such discontinuation or significant
reduction in the scope or amount of coverage is proposed there are no Incumbent Directors, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In all policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtained by the Company, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and
benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company's directors and officers most favorably insured by such policy. The Company may, but shall not be required to, create a trust
fund, grant a security interest or use other means, including without limitation a letter of credit, to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy its obligations to indemnify
and advance expenses pursuant to this Agreement. </FONT></P>

such payment to all of the related rights of recovery of Indemnitee against other persons or entities (other than Indemnitee's successors), including any entity or enterprise referred to in
clause&nbsp;(i) of the definition of "Indemnifiable Claim" in Section&nbsp;1. Indemnitee shall take, at the request of the Company, all actions reasonably necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of all papers reasonably required to evidence such rights (all of Indemnitee's reasonable Expenses, including attorneys' fees and charges, related thereto to be reimbursed by
the Company). </FONT></P>

standards of professional conduct then prevailing, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any
