</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Greg:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter confirms the terms of your separation from the employment of
Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices at 2535 Garcia Avenue,
Mountain View, CA 94043 (the &#147;Company&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination Date. Your employment with the Company is terminated
effective February&nbsp;14, 2003 (the &#147;Termination Date&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Shares. Assuming you do not exercise any stock options between today&#146;s
date and the Termination Date, on the Termination Date, you will hold vested
options to purchase shares of Intuit&#146;s Common Stock as indicated on the
Personnel Option Status report, attached hereto, as Exhibit&nbsp;A. Your options
will continue to vest until the Termination Date (but not thereafter) and will
remain exercisable for so long as you remain a member of a Board of Directors
of an Intuit subsidiary, and Intuit will amend your options accordingly. The
Company agrees that it will take all reasonable action necessary to continue
your membership on two such Boards of Directors (Intuit Ventures Inc. and
Quicken Investment Services Inc.) through July&nbsp;31, 2004, except that the
Company may remove you either: a) for &#147;Cause&#148; which shall mean (i)&nbsp;your
conviction or admission of any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude;
(ii)&nbsp;your participation in any act of fraud or malfeasance against the Company
or its subsidiary; (iii)&nbsp;your violation of any provision of this Agreement or
your Employee Proprietary Information and Confidentiality Agreement; (iv)&nbsp;your
violation of any of the policies of the Company or its subsidiaries, including
but not limited to the Company&#146;s Insider Trading Policy or Business Conduct
Guide; or (v)&nbsp;other misconduct in connection with the performance of your
duties as a director; or b) at any time without Cause if Intuit no longer has
the power to elect a majority of the members of the subsidiary&#146;s board. You
agree to resign from all such Intuit subsidiary Boards of Directors effective
July&nbsp;31, 2004 (your &#147;Board Termination Date&#148;). Breach of your obligation to so
resign shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. In accordance with
the terms of your original Stock Option Grant Agreements, you will have ninety
(90)&nbsp;days following your Board Termination Date (October&nbsp;29, 2004) in which to
exercise your options. You acknowledge that you have no additional options
other than those listed on Exhibit&nbsp;A.

owing to you from the Company as of the Termination Date. By acceptance of
this final paycheck you are acknowledging that the Company does not owe you any

18&nbsp;months from the Termination Date pursuant to the terms and conditions of
COBRA. You have 60&nbsp;days from the Termination Date to notify the Company in
writing of your election to so continue your continuation coverage, pursuant to
the terms and conditions of COBRA and at your own expense.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severance Payment. Provided you sign the General Release of all claims
attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B (the &#147;Release&#148;) on or promptly following February
14, 2003 you will receive, as severance, payment in an amount equivalent to
your current base salary for eighteen (18)&nbsp;months. You will also be paid
Fifty-Five Thousand Dollars ($55,000), in lieu of Intuit&#146;s paying the cost of
COBRA and other benefits for 18&nbsp;months<B>. </B>This severance pay is in addition to
any amounts due you from the Company and is given as consideration for the
Release. This severance will be paid to you in one lump sum within two weeks
of your signing Exhibit&nbsp;B. All normal withholding and deductions will be
applied.
</FONT>

through July&nbsp;31, 2003) will be paid at 100% of your target ($252, 000). This

and deductions will be applied.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soliciting, Recruiting, and Return of Company Property. You
acknowledge and agree that for a period of eighteen (18)&nbsp;months after the
Termination Date, you will not directly or indirectly solicit or recruit away
