consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than
those of the FCC.

4.5.     Title to Personal Property.

         Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5 hereto and except for leased

present use thereof by Seller.

4.8.     FCC Licenses.

         Schedule 2.1.1 lists and accurately describes all of the FCC Licenses
necessary for the lawful ownership and operation of the Stations and the conduct
of their businesses, except where the failure to hold any such FCC License would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has furnished to Purchaser true and
accurate copies of all of the FCC Licenses. Each such FCC License is in full
force and effect and is valid under applicable Laws; the Stations are being
operated in compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act, and
all rules, regulations and policies of the FCC; and to the knowledge of Seller,
no event has

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

occurred which (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the happening
or occurrence of any other event) is reasonably likely to result in the
revocation or termination of any FCC License or the imposition of any
restriction of such a nature as would have a Material Adverse Effect, except for
proceedings of a legislative or rule-making nature intended to affect the
broadcasting industry generally. The Stations, each of their physical

charges and other payments, if any, shown by such reports to be due and payable,
except where the failure to so file or make payment would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All reports required to be
filed by Seller with the FCC with respect to the Stations have been filed,
except where the failure to so file would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Such reports and disclosures are complete and accurate in all material respects.

4.10.    Taxes.

Purchased Assets have been filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority,

assessments or other charges due with respect to such Taxes, as reflected on the
filed returns or claimed to be due by such federal, state or local taxing
authorities (other than Taxes, deficiencies, assessments or claims which are
being contested in good faith and which in the aggregate are not material).
Seller has not received any written notice of any examinations or audits pending
or unresolved examinations or audit issues with respect to Seller's federal,
state or local Tax returns that could adversely affect the Purchased Assets. All
additional Taxes, if any, assessed as a result of such examinations or audits
have been paid, and to Seller's knowledge, there are no pending claims or

respect to the environmental condition of the Purchased Assets, Seller's
compliance with Environmental Laws, Hazardous Materials, Environmental Laws or

       Seller is not in default in any material respect under any of the Assumed

OR WORKMANSHIP THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR
PATENT.

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1.   Regulatory Approvals.

       6.1.1. No later than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, Seller
and Purchaser shall jointly cause to be filed by Seller's FCC counsel an
application with the FCC requesting the FCC's consent to the assignment of the
FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Nassau License Sub, which application is
attached hereto at Exhibit A (the "FCC Application"). Each party shall pay its
own expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of the FCC
Application and shall share equally any filing fees associated with the FCC
Application.

       6.1.2. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) obtain from any Governmental Authority or other Person any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or
Orders required to be obtained by Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR
License Sub to Nassau License Sub; (c) furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including filings in connection
with the FCC Application, and to supply promptly any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested in connection with such filings or
applications; (d) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any Order
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

FCC Order, including defending against and opposing any lawsuits or other
proceedings (including any FCC reconsideration or review), whether judicial or
administrative, reviewing or challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the assignment of the FCC
Licenses from BCR License Sub to Nassau License Sub; and (e) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary to assign the FCC Licenses from BCR License
Sub to Nassau License Sub or to consummate any other transactions contemplated
 by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary
delay of the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Nassau
License Sub or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby at
the behest of any Governmental Authority or other Person without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Without limiting this Section 6.1.2, Purchaser agrees to take any
and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to (i) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition, or trade regulation Law, including the Communications Act, that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) resolve any objection that
may be asserted by the FCC or any other Person in order to obtain promptly the
FCC Order or satisfy or comply with any conditions imposed by the FCC Order, in
all events so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible,
including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of such assets of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any
FCC license held by such persons) or otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that limit Purchaser's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with respect
to, or their ability to retain, any of their assets, in each case, as may be
required in order to obtain the FCC Order or avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order
in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or delaying the Closing. Purchaser covenants that prior to the Closing, no
changes shall be made in the direct or indirect ownership structure of Nassau
License Sub, except for such changes that would not delay (A) the processing by
the FCC of the FCC Application, and/or (B) the prompt issuance of the FCC Order.

          6.1.3.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order, the terms of
Section 6.1.2 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order becomes a Final
Order; provided, however, that such terms shall only survive as applied to
actions relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC Order becoming a
Final Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur prior to obtaining
the FCC Order.

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

6.2.  Third Party Consents and Notices.

      6.2.1.  Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Third
Party Consents as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. All
Third Party Consents shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and
none shall provide for any increase in cost or other change in terms and
conditions after the Closing which would be materially adverse to Purchaser.


      6.2.2.  If any Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to Closing,
and prior to Closing an Alternative Arrangement has been obtained with respect
to the Assumed Contract to which such Third Party Consent pertains (in each
case, a "Deferred Contract"), then Seller shall retain, until such time as such
Third Party Consent shall have been obtained by Seller, all rights to and
liabilities under the Deferred Contract. Until the assignment of the Deferred
Contract, (a) Seller shall continue to use reasonable best efforts and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller to obtain all required consents or approvals to
remove any other impediments to such assignment, and (b) Seller shall cooperate
with Purchaser (and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller) in any lawful
arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of such Deferred
Contract) that Purchaser shall receive the benefits of such Deferred Contract
after the Closing Date to the same extent, and without any additional cost or
expense to Purchaser, as if such Deferred Contract had been assigned to
Purchaser (such arrangement, an "Alternative Arrangement"). To the extent that
Purchaser receives such benefits, Purchaser shall assume Seller's Liabilities
thereunder arising on or after the Closing Date with respect to such Alternative
Arrangement and Purchaser shall perform any such obligations of Seller arising
under such Alternative Arrangement. If, subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall
obtain all required consents or approvals required to assign any Deferred
Contract, the Deferred Contract for which consent or approval to assign has been
obtained shall at that time be deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold,
transferred, setover, assigned, released, delivered and confirmed to Purchaser
and assumed by Purchaser, without need of further action by Seller or of further
documentation except for notice from Seller to Purchaser that such consent or
approval has been obtained; and from and after the effective date such Deferred
Contract is assigned to Purchaser, (i) no party shall have any further liability
under the Alternative Arrangement related thereto, and (ii) the Deferred
Contract shall be deemed to be an Assumed Contract.

      6.2.3.  Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to third
parties which have entered into material contracts with any of the Stations
(other than the Assumed Contracts) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that Purchaser is not assuming
any obligations of Seller or the Stations in respect of the contracts with such
third parties. Seller shall promptly provide copies of these written notices to
Purchaser.

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

6.3.  Access to Information.

      From the date hereof until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to Seller),
during normal business hours, Seller shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of Purchaser reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of Seller to the extent related to the
Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of Purchaser such additional information regarding
the Purchased Assets as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request in
order to assist Purchaser in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with
any of the businesses or operations of Seller or any Station.

6.4.  Confidentiality.

      The terms of the confidentiality agreement executed prior to the date
hereof (the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Seller and Purchaser are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Purchaser under this Section 6.4 shall terminate; provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of
that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Purchased Assets. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect.

6.5.  Public Announcements.

      Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party,
issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange to which Seller or
Purchaser is a party if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party and to obtain such party's consent but has been unable to do so in a
timely manner.

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

6.6.  Ordinary Course of Business.

      During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, unless the
prior consent of Purchaser is first obtained, Seller shall cause the Stations to
not knowingly take any action which would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.

6.7.  Control of the Station.

      Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly,
control, supervise, direct, or attempt to control, supervise, or direct, the
operations of the Stations; such operations, including complete control and
supervision of all of the Stations programs, employees, and policies, shall be
the sole responsibility of Seller until the Closing.

6.8.  Risk of Loss.

      Seller shall bear the risk of all damage to, loss of or destruction of any
of the Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.
If any material portion of the Purchased Assets (other than items that are
obsolete and not necessary for the continued operations of the Stations) shall
suffer any material damage or destruction prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction, shall
promptly take all necessary steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at
Seller's sole expense, and shall advise Purchaser in writing of the estimated
cost to complete such restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts
actually paid as of the date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that
Seller is diligently pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the
Closing Date shall be extended for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days to
accomplish such restoration, repair or replacement. If such restoration, repair
or replacement is not accomplished prior to the Closing Date, as the same may be
extended as provided herein, the parties shall consummate the Closing and
Purchaser shall receive all insurance proceeds paid or payable to Seller and
Purchaser shall thereafter complete such restoration, repair or replacement at
its sole expense; provided, however, Seller shall have no further liabilities
with respect to such damage or destruction after payment to Purchaser of such
insurance proceeds.

6.9.  Collection of Receivables.

      At the Closing, Seller shall assign the Accounts Receivables to Purchaser
for collection purposes only, and, within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser a list of the Accounts
Receivables by accounts and the amounts then owing. Purchaser agrees, for a
period of one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing Date (the

<PAGE>

without any requirement to litigate to collect the Accounts Receivables, to use
its reasonable best efforts (with at least the care and diligence Purchaser uses
to collect its own accounts receivables) to collect for Seller the Accounts
Receivables and to remit to Seller on the fifth day following the last day of
each month occurring during the Collection Period (or, if any such day is a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday, on the next Business Day), collections received by
Purchaser with respect to the Accounts Receivables. With each remittance,
Purchaser shall furnish a statement of the amounts collected and the Persons
from whom such amounts were collected. Purchaser shall not make any referral or
compromise of any Accounts Receivables to a collection agency or attorney for
collection and shall not compromise for less than full value any Account
Receivable without the prior written consent of Seller. Any Account Receivable
not collected by Purchaser within the Collection Period shall revert to Seller.
Purchaser shall reassign, without recourse to Purchaser, each Account Receivable
and deliver to Seller, all records relating thereto on the same day as it remits
to Seller the collections received. All payments in respect of the Accounts
Receivables received during the Collection Period shall be first applied to the
oldest balance then due on the Accounts Receivables unless the account debtor
indicates in writing that payment is to be applied otherwise due to a dispute
over an Account Receivable. Purchaser agrees, upon the reasonable request of
Seller, to furnish to Seller periodic reports on the status of Seller's Accounts
Receivables. Purchaser shall have no right to set-off any amounts collected for
Accounts Receivables for any amounts owed to Purchaser by Seller.

6.10.  Employees.

       Schedule 6.10 contains a list of all of the employees of the Stations. On
or prior to January 7, 2003, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a list of the
employees of the Stations that Purchaser shall retain after the Closing.

6.11.  Relocation of Transmitter Site.

       Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and
approvals necessary for Purchaser to relocate the WWYY Transmitter Site from the
current location to Purchaser's tower site located in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt of all such
consents and approvals.

6.12.  Requisite Consents to Assign this Agreement.

       Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and
approvals necessary for Purchaser to assign all or any portion of Purchaser's
rights under this Agreement to Nassau Partnership or Nassau Operating Sub in
accordance with Section 11.8.1 on or prior to January 15, 2002.

inadequate. Consequently, Seller and Purchaser agree that each shall be
entitled, in the event of a default by the other, to specific performance of any
of the provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other legal or equitable

documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, at any time, prior
to, at or after the Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further
actions, and execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and
filed such further documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

consent of the other party hereto; provided, however, that prior to Closing,
Purchaser may assign all or any portion of Purchaser's rights under this
Agreement to Nassau Partnership or Nassau Operating Sub only if the following
are satisfied prior to such assignment: (a) Purchaser shall have provided prior
