                           CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT

         AGREEMENT by and between Avista Corporation, a Washington corporation
(the "Company") and ______________________________________, (the "Executive"),
dated as of the ____ day of ________________________, 20__.

         The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), has determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure
that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as
defined below) of the Company. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish
the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal
uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and
to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company
currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and
to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a
Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations
of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other
corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has
caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

         1.       Certain Definitions. (a) The "Effective Date" shall mean the
first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on
which a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if
the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on
which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the
Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third
party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or
(ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control,
then for all purposes of this Agreement the "Effective date" shall mean the date
immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.

                  (b)      The "Change of Control Period" shall mean the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date
hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the date one year after the date
hereof, and on each annual anniversary of such date (such date and each annual
anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal Date"),
unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be
automatically extended so as to terminate three (3) years from such Renewal
Date, unless at least sixty (60) days prior to the Renewal Date the Company
shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not
be so extended.

         2.       Change of Control. For the purpose of this Agreement, a
"Change of Control" shall mean:

                  (a)      The acquisition by any individual, entity or group
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange

                                        1
<PAGE>

Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of either
(i) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the "Outstanding
Company Common Stock") or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding
voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that
for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not
constitute a Change of Control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Company,
(ii) any acquisition by the Company, (iii) any acquisition by any employee
benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
corporation controlled by the Company or (iv) any acquisition by any corporation
pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of
subsection (c) of this Section 2; or

                  (b)      Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute
the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with
respect to the election or removal of directors, or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the
Board; or

                  (c)      Consummation of a reorganization, merger or
consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless,
following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the
individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the
Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities
immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding
shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding
voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as
the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination
(including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such
transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets
either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination
of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting
Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation
resulting from such Business Combination or employee benefit plan (or related
trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business
Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or
more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to
the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and
(iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the
Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the
action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

                                        2
<PAGE>

                  (d)      Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a
complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

         3.       Employment Period. The Company hereby agrees to continue the
Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ
of the Company subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for the
period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary of
such date (the "Employment Period").

         4.       Terms of Employment. (a) Position and Duties. (i) During the
Employment Period, (A) the Executive's position (including status, offices,
titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall
be at least commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of
those held, exercised and assigned at any time during the one hundred twenty
(120) day period immediately preceding the Effective Date and (B) the
Executive's services shall be performed at the location where the Executive was
employed immediately preceding the Effective Date or any office or location less
than 35 miles from such location.

                           (ii)     During the Employment Period, and excluding
any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the
Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal business
hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to
discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the
Executive's reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such
responsibilities. During the Employment Period it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable
boards or committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or
teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long
as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the
Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with
this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that
any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective
Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities
similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not
thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's
responsibilities to the Company.

                  (b)      Compensation. (i) Base Salary. During the Employment
Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary ("Annual Base
Salary"), which shall be paid at a monthly rate, at least equal to twelve times
the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any base salary which
has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated
companies in respect of the twelve month period immediately preceding the month
in which the Effective Date occurs. During the Employment Period, the Annual
Base Salary shall be reviewed no more than 12 months after the last salary
increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at
least annually. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or
reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. Annual Base
Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase and the term Annual Base
Salary as utilized in this Agreement shall refer to Annual Base Salary as so
increased. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliated companies" shall
include any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the
Company.

                                        3

                           (ii)     Annual Bonus. In addition to Annual Base
Salary, the Executive shall be awarded, for each fiscal year ending during the
Employment Period, an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") in cash at least equal
to the Executive's highest bonus under the Company's Annual Incentive Plans, or
any comparable bonus under any predecessor or successor plan, for the last three
(3) full fiscal years prior to the Effective Date (annualized in the event that
the Executive was not employed by the Company for the whole of such fiscal year)
(the "Recent Annual Bonus"). Each such Annual bonus shall be paid no later than
the end of the third month of the fiscal year next following the fiscal year for
which the Annual Bonus is awarded, unless the Executive shall elect to defer the
receipt of such Annual Bonus.

                           (iii)    Incentive, Savings and Retirement Plans.
During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in
all incentive, savings and retirement plans, practices, policies and programs
applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated
companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs
provide the Executive with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to
both regular and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that
such distinction is applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit
opportunities, in each case, less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most
favorable of those provided by the Company and its affiliated companies for the
Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any
time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or if
more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the
Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated
companies.

                           (iv)     Welfare Benefit Plans. During the Employment
Period, the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall
be eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare
benefit plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company and its
affiliated companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription,
dental, disability, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel
accident insurance plans and programs) to the extent applicable generally to
other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies, but in no
event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive
with benefits which are less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most
favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in effect for the
Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally
at any time after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and
its affiliated companies.

                           (v)      Expenses. During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Executive in accordance with the most favorable
policies, practices and procedures of the Company and its affiliated companies
in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately
preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in
effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of
the Company and its affiliated companies.

                           (vi)     Fringe Benefits. During the Employment
Period, the Executive shall be entitled to fringe benefits, including, without
limitation, tax and financial planning

                                        4
<PAGE>

services, payment of club dues, and, if applicable, use of an automobile and
payment of related expenses, in accordance with the most favorable plans,
practices, programs and policies of the Company and its affiliated companies in
effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day period immediately
preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in
effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of
the Company and its affiliated companies.

                           (vii)    Office and Support Staff. During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to an office or offices of a
size and with furnishings and other appointments, and to exclusive personal
secretarial and other assistance, at least equal to the most favorable of the
foregoing provided to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies
at any time during the 120-period immediately preceding the Effective date or,
if more favorable to the Executive, as provided generally at any time thereafter
with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated
companies.

                           (viii)   Vacation. During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the most
favorable plans, policies, programs and practices of the Company and its
affiliated companies as in effect for the Executive at any time during the
120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to
the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to
other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies.

         5.       Termination of Employment. (a) Death or Disability. The
Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive's death
during the Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that the
Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant
to the definition of Disability set forth below), it may give to the Executive
written notice in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement of its
intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the
Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th
day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective
Date), provided that, within the thirty (30) days after such receipt, the
Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's
duties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of
the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis
for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive business days as a result of incapacity
due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be total and permanent
by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the
Executive or the Executive's legal representative.

                  (b)      Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive's
employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:

                           (i)      the willful and continued failure of the
Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties with the Company or
one of its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due
to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial
performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the
Board or Chief

                                        5
<PAGE>

Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed
the Executive's duties, or

                           (ii)     the willful engaging by the Executive in
illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably
injurious to the Company.

For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the
Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be
done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the
Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or
a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the
Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation
of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and
until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution
duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the
entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for
such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the
Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the
Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is
guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

                  (c)     Good Reason. The Executive's employment may be
terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Good Reason" shall mean:

                           (i)      the assignment to the Executive of any
duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including
status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or
responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a) of this Agreement, or any other
action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority,
duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated,
insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is
remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the
Executive;

                           (ii)     any failure by the Company to comply with
any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated,
insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is
remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the
Executive;

                           (iii)    the Company's requiring the Executive to be
based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B)
hereof or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to
a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective
Date;

                           (iv)     any purported termination by the Company of
the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this
Agreement; or

                                        6
<PAGE>

                           (v)      any failure by the Company to comply with
and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 5(c), a determination of "Good Reason" made by the
Executive with which the Company does not agree shall be resolved pursuant to
the following dispute resolution procedure. First, the parties shall in good
faith attempt to resolve any dispute arising hereunder. Second, if such efforts
are unsuccessful, the parties shall submit to binding arbitration with such
arbitration to be conducted in Spokane, Washington, by the American Arbitration
Association under its National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes.

                  (d)      Notice of Termination. Any termination by the Company
for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice
of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b)
of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination"
means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and
(iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of
receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not
more than thirty days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the
Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or
circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not
waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or
preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or
circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                  (e)      Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the
Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or
any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's
employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the
Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the
Executive of such termination and (iii) if the Executive's employment is
terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be
the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case
may be.

         6.       Obligations of the Company upon Termination. (a) Good Reason;
Other Than for Cause, Death or Disability. If, during the Employment Period, the
Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Cause or
Disability or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason:

                           (i)      the Company shall pay to the Executive in a
lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination the
aggregate of the following amounts:

                                    (A)      the sum of (1) the Executive's
Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore
paid, (2) the product of (x) the higher of (I) the Recent Annual Bonus and (II)
the Annual Bonus paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which
has been earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year consisting

                                        7
<PAGE>

of less than twelve (12) full months or during which the Executive was employed
for less than twelve (12) full months), for the most recently completed fiscal
year during the Employment Period, if any (such higher amount being referred to
as the "Highest Annual Bonus" and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and
the denominator of which is 365 and (3) any compensation previously deferred by
the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and any
accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum
of the amounts described in clauses (1), (2), and (3) shall be hereinafter
referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                                    (B)      the amount equal to the product of
(1) two and (2) the sum of (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the
Highest Annual Bonus; and

                                    (C)      an amount equal to the excess of
(a) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the Company's qualified
defined benefit retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing actuarial
assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
Company's Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date), and any
excess or supplemental retirement plan in which the Executive participates
(together, the "SERP") which the Executive would receive if the Executive's
employment continued for two years after the Date of Termination assuming for
this purpose that all accrued benefits are fully vested, and, assuming that the
Executive's compensation in each of the two years is that required by Section
4(b)(i) and Section 4(b)(ii), over (b) the actuarial equivalent of the
Executive's actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan
and the SERP as of the Date of Termination;

                           (ii)     for two years after the Executive's Date of
Termination, or such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the
appropriate plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue
benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those
which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs,
practices and policies described in Section 4(b) (iv) of this Agreement if the
Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the
Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families,
provided, however, that if the Executive becomes re-employed with another
employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
another employer provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described
herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such
applicable period of eligibility. For purposes of determining eligibility (but
not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree benefits
pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be
considered to have remained employed until two years after the Date of
Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period;

                           (iii)    the Company shall, at its sole expense as
incurred, with payment made directly to the provider of services, provide the
Executive with outplacement services the scope and provider of which shall be
selected by the Executive with the Company having payment approval, in its sole
discretion, for reasonable services for a period of two (2) years at a cost of
not greater than thirty-thousand dollars ($30,000); and

                                        8
<PAGE>

                           (iv)     to the extent not theretofore paid or
provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other
amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is
eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or
agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and
benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits").

                  (b)      Death. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement
shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal
representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued
Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued
Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as
applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.
With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as
utilized in this Section 6(b) shall include, without limitation, and the
Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits
at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and
affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of peer executives of the
Company and such affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices arid
policies relating to death benefits, if any, as in effect with respect to other
peer executives and their beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period
immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the
Executive's estate and/or the Executive's beneficiaries, as in effect on the
date of the Executive's death with respect to other peer executives of the
Company and its affiliated companies and their beneficiaries.

                  (c)      Disability. If the Executive's employment is
terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period,
this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive,
other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or
provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive
in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to
the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this
Section 6(c) shall include, and the Executive shall be entitled after the
Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at least
equal to the most favorable of those generally provided by the Company and its
affiliated companies to disabled executives and/or their families in accordance
with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to disability, if
any, as in effect generally with respect to other peer executives and their
families at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's
family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer
executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their families.

                  (d)      Cause; Other than for Good Reason. If the Executive's
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this
Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive (x) his Annual Base Salary through
the Date of Termination, (y) the amount of any compensation previously deferred
by the Executive, and (z) Other Benefits, in each case to the extent theretofore
unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment
Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate
without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations
and the timely payment or

                                        9
<PAGE>

provision of Other Benefits. In such case, all Accrued Obligations shall be paid
to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of
Termination.

         7.       Non-Exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan,
program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated
companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to Section
12(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the
Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of
its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the
Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or
program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its
affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be
payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or
agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

         8.       Full Settlement. The Company's obligation to make the payments
provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations
hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the
Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other
employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable
to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts
shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. The
Company agrees to pay interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal
rate provided for in Section 7872(f) (2) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). In any suit, proceeding, dispute or action
(including arbitration) to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, in connection with such suit, proceeding, dispute or
action, including appeal.

         9.       Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

                  (a)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding and except as Set forth below, in the event it shall be
determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit
of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without
regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9) (a "Payment")
would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any
interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise
tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an
amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without
limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with
respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive
retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon
the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9 (a), if
it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but
that the Payments do not exceed 110% of the greatest amount (the "Reduced
Amount") that could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of Payments
would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up

                                       10
<PAGE>

Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall
be reduced to the Reduced amount.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all
determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and
when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
by Deloitte and Touche or such other certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen
(15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has
been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the
event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall
appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations
required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to
this Section 9, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days
of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result
of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of
the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made
hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to
Section 9(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any
Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment
that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.

                  (c)      The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim
is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the
expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive
shall:

                           (i)      give the Company any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to such claim;

                           (ii)     take such action in connection with
contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from
time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with
respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company;

                                       11
<PAGE>

                           (iii)    cooperate with the Company in good faith in
order effectively to contest such claim, and

                           (iv)     permit the Company to participate in any
proceedings relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection
with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct
the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim
in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to
a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial
jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall
determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such, claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which
such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and
the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any
other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
authority.

                  (d)      If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled
to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject
to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay
to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or
credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the
Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9 (c), a
determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund
with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in
writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration
of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and
shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset,
to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

         10.      Confidential Information. The Executive shall hold in a
fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential
information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated
companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by
the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its

                                       12
<PAGE>

affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other
than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation
of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company
and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the
provisions of this Section 10 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding
any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement. Any Avista
Corporation Employee Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Invention Agreement
signed by Executive is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full.

         11.      Successors. (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive
and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by
the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Executive's legal representatives.

                  (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

                  (c)      The Company will require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession
has taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as
herein before defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as
aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of
law, or otherwise.

         12.      Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without
reference to principles of conflict of laws. Venue for any suit, action or
proceeding concerning this agreement is to be in the Superior Court of the State
of Washington for Spokane County. By this Agreement, the parties confer
jurisdiction over the subject matter of and parties to this Agreement to the
Superior Court of the State of Washington for Spokane County. The captions of
this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or
effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors
and legal representatives.

                  (b)      All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed as follows:

                           If to the Executive:

                                       13
<PAGE>

                           If to the Company:

                                             Attention: General Counsel

or to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in
writing in accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.

                  (c)      The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement.

                  (d)      The Company may withhold from amounts payable under
this Agreement such Federal, state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required
to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

                  (e)      The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist
upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or the failure to
assert any right the Executive or the Company may have hereunder, including,
without limitation, the right of the Executive to terminate employment for Good
Reason pursuant to Section 5(c)(i)-(v) of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to
be a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this
Agreement.

                  (f)      The Executive and the Company acknowledge that,
except as may otherwise be provided under any other written agreement between
the Executive and the Company, the employment of the Executive by the Company is
"at will" and, subject to Section 1(a) hereof, prior to the Effective Date, the
Executive's employment and/or this Agreement may be terminated by either the
Executive or the Company at any time prior to the Effective date, in which case
the Executive shall have no further rights under this Agreement. From and after
the Effective date this Agreement shall supersede any other agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set the Executive's hand
and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of Directors, the Company has
caused these presents to be executed in its name on its behalf, all as of the
day and year first above written.
