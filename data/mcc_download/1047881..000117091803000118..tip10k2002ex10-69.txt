                  as it is  prohibited  from doing so by law or by obligation to
                  any other person. Pro-Fit shall not hereinafter enter into any
                  obligation with any other person prohibiting disclosure to TPI
                  of the Improvements
         12.2     Improvements which Pro-Fit is due to disclose to TPI hereunder

--------------------------------------
         13.1     TPI shall  inform  Pro-Fit  promptly in writing of any alleged
                  infringement  of the Licensed  Patent  Rights by a third party
                  and of any available evidence thereof.
         13.2     Pro-Fit shall have the right,  but shall not be obligated,  to
                  prosecute at its own expense all infringements of the Licensed
                  Patent Rights and, in  furtherance  of such right,  TPI hereby
                  agrees that  Pro-Fit may include TPI as a party  plaintiff  in
                  any such suit,  without  expense to TPI. The total cost of any
                  such  infringement  action  commenced  or  defended  solely by
                  Pro-Fit shall be borne by Pro-Fit,  and Pro-Fit shall keep any
                  recovery or damages for past infringement derived therefrom.
         13.3     If within three (3) months  after  having been  notified of an
                  alleged infringement,  Pro-Fit shall have been unsuccessful in
                  persuading the alleged  infringer to desist and shall not have
                  brought   and  shall   not  be   diligently   prosecuting   an
                  infringement  action,  or if Pro-Fit  shall  notify TPI at any
                  time prior  thereto of its intention not to bring suit against
                  any alleged  infringer in the  Territory,  then,  and in those
                  events  only,  TPI  shall  have the  right,  but  shall not be
                  obligated, to prosecute at its own expense any infringement of
                  the Licensed Patent Rights in the Territory,  and TPI may, for
                  such purposes, use the name of Pro-Fit as party plaintiff.  No

                  or  other  voluntary  final  disposition  of the  suit  may be
                  entered  into  without the consent of Pro-Fit,  which  consent
                  shall not unreasonably be withheld.
         13.4     In the  event  that TPI  shall  undertake  litigation  for the
                  enforcement of the Licensed Patent Rights in the Territory, or
                  the  defense of the  Licensed  Patent  Rights  under the prior
                  Clause  13.3,  TPI may  withhold  up to  ***% of the  payments
                  otherwise  thereafter due Pro-Fit  hereunder (but not payments
                  due in Year 1) and  apply  the same  toward  reimbursement  of
                  TPI's  expenses,  including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  in
                  connection therewith.  Any recovery of damages by TPI for each
                  such  suit  shall  be  applied  first in  satisfaction  of any
                  unreimbursed  expenses  and legal fees of TPI relating to such
                  suit,  and  next  toward  reimbursement  of  Pro-Fit  for  any
                  payments  under  Article 4 past due or  withheld  and  applied
                  pursuant to this Clause 13.4.  The balance  remaining from any
                  such  recovery  shall  be  divided  ***%  to TPI  and  ***% to
                  Pro-Fit, respectively
         13.5     In the  event  that a  declaratory  judgment  action  alleging
                  invalidity or non  infringement  of any of the Licensed Patent
                  Rights shall be brought  against Pro-Fit or TPI,  Pro-Fit,  at
                  its  option,  shall have the right,  within  thirty  (30) days
                  after  commencement  of such  action,  to take  over  the sole
                  defense of the action at its own expense. If Pro-Fit shall not
                  exercise  this  right,  TPI may take over the sole  defense at
                  TPI's sole expense, subject to the prior Clause 13.4.
         13.6     In any  infringement  suit as either  party may  institute  to
                  enforce the Licensed Patent Rights pursuant to this Agreement,
                  the other party  hereto  shall,  at the request and expense of
                  the party initiating such suit, cooperate in all respects and,
                  to the  extent  possible,  have  its  employees  testify  when
                  requested  and  make  available   relevant  records,   papers,
                  information, samples, specimens, and the like.

14.      ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY TPI
------------------------------------
         In the event that a court  issues a  temporary  restraining  order or a
         preliminary or permanent  injunction based on claims that TPI infringes
         the rights of a third party due to TPI's  exercise of any of its rights
         hereunder,  Pro-Fit  shall  either:  (1) contest  the  validity of such
         claim,  including,  without  limitation,  filing an  opposition  to any
         infringement action brought pursuant to such claim (2) obtain a license
         from such third  party,  at  Pro-Fit's  sole  expense,  to allow TPI to
         continue  exercising its rights hereunder,  or (3) modify its Processes
         so that  they are no longer  infringing  while  insuring  substantially
         equivalent benefits from the standpoint of performance,  functionality,
         cost,  marketability and  manufacturability.  In the event that a third
         party shall obtain a final judgement in such party's favor with respect
         to

         clauses (2) and (3) of the preceding sentence

15.      INTERLININGS
---------------------
         15.1     TPI recognises and agrees that:
                  15.1.1   the Equipment has been manufactured and installed for
                           use in  conjunction  with  Interlinings  produced and
                           manufactured  by  suppliers  approved  by  Pro-Fit as
                           producing Interlinings of an appropriate standard and
                           quality level, sufficient for mass-market production;
                  15.1.2   the  Interlinings so produced and manufactured are of
                           a level of  quality  sufficient  for mass  production
                           using the Processes, and are necessary for the proper
                           exploitation  of the  Processes  and the operation of
                           the Equipment; and
                  15.1.3   the  use  of  Interlinings  of a  standard  presently
                           provided by Pro-Fit is a  reasonable  requirement  of
                           Pro-Fit  and  necessary  to protect  the value of its
                           trademarks and the goodwill therein
                  15.1.4   Pro-Fit represents and warrants that the Interlinings
                           will  be  of a  quality  level  sufficient  for  mass
                           production using the Processes
         15.2     Having  regard to the issues set out in the  foregoing  clause
                  TPI agrees  that,  subject  hereto,  it will  purchase all its
                  requirement  for  Interlinings to be used in the production of
                  the  Products  from  Pro-Fit  and  Pro-Fit  agrees to promptly
                  supply TPI with its ordered  Interlinings in the normal course
                  of business.
         15.3     The  Interlinings  will be  purchased  from  Pro-Fit by TPI at
                  Prices To Be Agreed upon from time to time
         15.4     If TPI can  demonstrate  to  Pro-Fit  that it can  source  the
                  Interlining from an alternative supplier at a lower price than
                  the Pro-Fit price but of the same or  sufficient  standard and
                  quality (as to which Pro-Fit shall advise,  acting  reasonably
                  properly  and  promptly)  then  TPI  shall  give  Pro-Fit  the
                  opportunity  to  match  such  price  (landed  duty  paid)  and
                  delivery.  If Pro-Fit  does not match such price  (landed duty
                  paid) and delivery then this clause shall cease to have effect
         15.5     If for any reason,  Pro-Fit is  unwilling or unable to fulfill
                  any order for Interlinings  from TPI, TPI shall have the right
                  to  immediately  and  thereafter  source  Interlining  from an
                  alternative supplier
         15.6     Pro-Fit represents and warrants that the Interlinings supplied
                  by Pro-Fit  shall be in good  working  order,  comply with the
                  samples and  specifications  thereof  provided to TPI, free of
                  defects,  merchantable  and fit for  their  intended  purpose,

                  regulatory standards for territories other than the USA and UK
                  unless Pro-Fit has been notified of the applicable  regulatory
                  standards prior to its receipt of the applicable order.
         15.7     Where   Pro-Fit  has   specified  a  standard  or  quality  of

16.      ROYALTIES

         16.1     In  consideration  of the rights  granted under this Agreement
                  TPI shall, subject to the following provisions, pay to Pro-Fit

                  days  after the end of the second  Quarter  (of each Year) for
                  the royalties  accrued  during the first two Quarters (of each
                  Year) and 90 days after the end of the Fourth Quarter (of each
                  Year) for the royalties  accrued  during the last two Quarters
                  (of each Year),  at which times TPI shall deliver to Pro-Fit a
                  statement showing how the payments were calculated
         16.3     TPI shall keep true and accurate Records in sufficient  detail
                  to enable the amount of all royalties to be determined
         16.4     TPI shall at the  reasonable  request of Pro-Fit  from time to
                  time allow  Pro-Fit or its agent (or procure  that  Pro-Fit or
                  its agent is  allowed) to inspect the  Records,  at  Pro-Fit's
                  expense  (subject  to  reimbursement  below) and to the extent
                  that they relate to the calculation of the royalties,  to take
                  copies of them
         16.5     TPI shall at  Pro-Fit's  expense  obtain and submit to Pro-Fit
                  within  90  Business  Days  after  the  end  of  each  Year  a
                  certificate  by  TPI's  auditors  or  an  independent  royalty
                  statement  auditor that the statements  submitted in that Year
                  are true and accurate
         16.6     If following an inspection or auditor's  certificate  pursuant
                  to this clause it transpires that the amount of royalties paid
                  in  respect  of the Year fell  short of the  amount  which was
                  properly payable in that Year then TPI shall within 7 Business
                  Days of the date of the  inspection or certificate as the case
                  may be, as Pro-Fit's sole remedy for such  shortfall,  pay the
                  shortfall  to Pro-Fit.  In the event that the  shortfall is an
                  amount which  exceeds ***% of the amount of royalties  paid in
                  respect of such Year, then TPI shall reimburse Pro-Fit for the
                  reasonable  costs and  expenses  up to *** of the  inspection,
                  including  costs of Pro-Fit as well as auditors  costs. In the
                  event of a dispute  regarding  any alleged  shortfall or if an
                  obligation to render a payment is disputed, TPI shall have the
                  right to deposit the disputed amount in escrow and

                  TPI  shall  not be in  breach  or  default  of this  Agreement
                  provided  that the disputed  amount is deposited in escrow and
                  the arbitration  proceedings are in process.  In the event the
                  inspection  reveals an overpayment by TPI, TPI shall receive a
                  credit against the next payment due hereunder in the amount of
                  such overpayment.
         16.7     TPI guarantees that the minimum  royalties payable during each
                  Year  shall  be  as   specified   in  Part  2  of  Schedule  5
                  irrespective  of  the  amount  of  Product  actually  sold  or
                  supplied
         16.8     In the event that the aggregate royalty payments due in a Year
                  are in excess of the  guaranteed  amount then TPI shall pay to
                  Pro-Fit such shortfall within 90 days of the end of such Year.
         16.9     Within 30 Business  Days of each Quarter end TPI shall deliver
                  a quarterly  report to Pro-Fit  describing  its  progress  and
                  developments   with   its   manufacturing   and   distribution
                  activities   in  the   immediately   preceding   Quarter   and
                  projections for the forthcoming Quarter. However, it shall not
                  be a breach of this Agreement (unless such report is more than
                  30 days late)

                  the holder hereof without charge."
         17.5     Pro-Fit  agrees  that it will not  Transfer  any of the Shares
                  without  complying  with  each of the  restrictions  set forth
                  herein and  pursuant  to  applicable  law and  agrees  that in

                  TPI,  deliver at its expense to TPI an opinion of counsel,  in
                  form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to TPI and counsel

                  Transferred  as above shall bear the  appropriate  restrictive

                  is not required  (under Rule 144(k) or  otherwise) in order to
                  establish  compliance  with any  provisions of the  Securities
                  Act.   Notwithstanding   anything  set  forth  herein  to  the
                  contrary,  Pro-Fit shall not Transfer any of the Shares except
                  in accordance with Clauses 17.2 and 17.8.

                  Shares and the business  prospects and financial  condition of
                  TPI,  and  (3)  it is  not  relying  on  the  accuracy  of any
                  projections   with  respect  to  TPI  or  TPI's   business  or
                  operations in its decision to acquire the Shares.
         17.7     TPI  represents  and  warrants to Pro-Fit that the Shares have
                  been duly authorised by all necessary  corporate action on the
                  party of TPI and,  when  payment  is made  for the  Shares  in
                  accordance  with this  Agreement,  the Shares shall be validly
                  issued,  fully  paid,  and  nonassessable  and will be free of

                  permitted  to Transfer  any of the Shares  unless  Pro-Fit has
                  complied with this Clause 17.8. If Pro-Fit intends to Transfer
                  any of its  Shares,  Pro-Fit  shall give  written  notice (the

                  terms and conditions of such Transfer. A Seller's Notice shall
                  constitute  an  irrevocable  election  by  Pro-Fit to sell the
                  Shares identified therein to TPI.
         17.9     TPI shall have the irrevocable  and exclusive  option (but not

                  Shares  at a price per  share  equal to the  lesser of (i) the
                  average  closing  price  of the  Shares  during  the  five (5)
                  trading  days  immediately  preceding  the date  the  Seller's
                  Notice is  delivered by Pro-Fit or (ii) the terms set forth in
                  the Seller's Notice (the "Sale Price").  TPI may exercise such
                  option by  delivering  within  fifteen (15)  calendar  days of
                  receipt of the Seller's  Notice a written notice (the "Company
                  Notice")  to the  Proposed  Seller  stating  its  election  to
                  exercise  its option  under this Clause 17.9 and the number of
                  First  Refusal  Shares it is willing to  purchase  at the Sale
                  Price,  and  such  notice  shall  constitute  and  irrevocable
                  commitment  to  purchase  such  Shares.  In the event that TPI
                  delivers a Company Notice,  the closing of the Transfer of the
                  First  Refusal  Shares from Pro-Fit to TPI shall take place at
                  the offices of TPI within 5 business  days of the  delivery of
                  such Company Notice, or at such other time and place as may be
                  mutually agreed upon by Pro-Fit and TPI.
         17.10    If any shares are not elected to be  purchased by TPI pursuant
                  to Clause 17.9,  then,  subject to Clauses 17.2, 17.4 and 17.5
                  hereof,  Pro-Fit  shall be free,  for a period of ninety  (90)
                  days from the date of the Seller's Notice,  to sell the Shares
                  to the Proposed  Transferee,  at a price per share equal to or
                  greater  than the Sale Price and upon terms no more  favorable
                  to the Proposed  Transferee (or unsolicited broker transaction
                  as specified in the Seller's  Notice) than those  specified in
                  the  Seller's  Notice.  Any  Transfer of the  remaining  First
                  Refusal  Shares by the  Pro-Fit  after the end of such  ninety
                  (90) day  period or any change in the terms of the sale as set
                  forth in the Seller's  Notice which are more  favorable to the
                  Proposed  Transferee  shall  require a new notice of intent to
                  Transfer  to be  delivered  to TPI and shall give rise anew to
                  the rights provided in the preceding Clauses 17.8 and 17.9.

                  Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
                  Information"  means any information that a party designates as

                  required to be  disclosed  by a court or  governmental  agency
                  pursuant to a statute,  regulation  or valid order  including,
                  but not limited to, the rules of the American  Stock  Exchange
                  or any subsequent  stock exchange on which the securities of a
                  party are  listed;  provided  that the  receiving  party first
                  notifies the disclosing  party and gives it the opportunity to
                  seek a protective order or to contest such required disclosure
         19.2     RESTRICTIONS.  Each party  shall hold the  disclosing  party's
                  Confidential  Information in confidence and shall not use such
                  information  except as permitted  under this  Agreement.  Each
                  party shall use the same precautions to prevent  disclosure to
                  third  parties  of such  information  as it uses  with its own
                  confidential information,  but in no case less than reasonable
                  efforts
         19.3     ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  Each party agrees (i) not to alter or

                  part of the Confidential  Information,  and (ii) to notify the
                  other party of the  circumstances  surrounding any possession,
