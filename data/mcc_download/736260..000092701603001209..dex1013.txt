     mortgage obligation, collateralized bond obligation or similar instrument)
     to the extent that such obligation requires a cash payment by JHFS, JHLIC

     accounts of such Person, and (z) obligations issued under the John Hancock
     Life Insurance Company SignatureNotes(sm) program as from time to time in
     effect."

Amendment Effective Date, and each Exiting Bank is hereby released from its

     Notes (the "Exiting Bank Notes") for cancellation, and receipt by the
     Borrowers of the Exiting Bank Notes marked "Canceled" by the Agent;
     provided, that if any Exiting Bank shall be unable to produce one or more

     indemnity concerning any claim under such canceled Note(s);

          (c)  the fact that all amounts payable by the Borrowers on or before

     hereto, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent;

provided that this Second Amendment shall not become effective or be binding on
any party hereto unless all of the foregoing conditions are satisfied not later
than July 26, 2002. At the closing, the Agent or its counsel shall deliver a
notice to the Borrowers and the Banks advising them of the Second Amendment
Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto.

     6.   Representations and Warranties. Each Borrower severally represents and
warrants, but only with respect to itself, that:

          (a)  Representations in First Amended Credit Agreement. Each of the
     representations and warranties made by such Borrower in the First Amended
     Credit Agreement is true, correct and complete on and as of the date hereof
     with the same full force and effect as if each of such representations and
     warranties had been made by the Borrower on the date hereof and in this
     Second Amendment (except to the extent such representations and warranties
     expressly relate to an earlier date).

          (b)  No Defaults or Events of Default. No Default or Event of Default
     exists on the date of this Second Amendment (after giving effect to all of

     authorized, executed and delivered by such Borrower and is in full force
     and effect as of the date hereof, and the agreements and obligations of
     such Borrower contained herein constitute the legal, valid, and binding
     obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in
     accordance with its terms.

                                       -5-

<PAGE>

     7.   Miscellaneous. This Second Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. In making
proof of this Second Amendment, it shall not be necessary to produce or account
for more than one counterpart thereof signed by each of the parties hereto.
Except to the extent specifically amended and supplemented hereby, all of the
terms, conditions and provisions of the First Amended Credit Agreement and the
Notes shall remain unmodified, and the First Amended Credit Agreement and the
Notes, as amended and supplemented by this Second Amendment, are confirmed as
being in full force and effect, and each Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms
all of its agreements and obligations contained therein. This Second Amendment
and the rights and obligations of each of the parties hereto shall be governed
by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This Second
Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties
hereto and their respective successors in title and assigns.

The Rating Level of each Eligible Borrower shall be determined as follows: (a)
with respect to the 364-Day Revolver, the highest senior unsecured long term
debt rating of such Eligible Borrower as provided by S&P or Moody's, and (b)
with respect to the Multi-Year Revolver, (i) if S&P and/or Moody's has assigned
a rating to the senior unsecured long term debt of such Eligible Borrower, the
highest of such ratings, or (ii) if neither S&P nor Moody's has assigned a
rating to the senior unsecured debt of such Eligible Borrower, then the highest
short term Commercial Paper rating of such Eligible Borrower as provided by S&P
or Moody's.

Applicable Euro-Dollar Margins shall be determined first according to the
Ratings Level of the Eligible Borrower making the borrowing.

The Applicable Usage Fee shall be determined by Rating Level of the Eligible
Borrower which yields the highest Applicable Usage Fee. The Applicable Usage Fee
shall apply only to Euro-Dollar Loans.

The Facility Fee shall be determined by the Rating Level of the Eligible
Borrower which yields the highest Facility Fee.

If the Borrowers exercise the one-year term-out-option with respect to Committed
Loans under the 364-Day Revolver, a premium of 15 basis points will be added to
the drawn cost thereunder.
