</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THIS AGREEMENT is by and between Diversified Corporate Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation (herein called the "Company"), and Samuel E. Hunter (herein called "Optionee").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Optionee is a director of the Company; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Company considers it desirable and in its best interests that Optionee be given an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company in the form of an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the option covered by this Agreement is issued pursuant to the Company's Non-Employee Director 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, it is agreed as follows:</P>
<OL>
<OL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>GRANT OF OPTION</U>. The Company shall and does hereby grant to Optionee the right, privilege and option to purchase 12,500 shares (the "Shares") of Common Stock for the price per share in the manner and subject to the conditions hereinafter provided.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>TIME OF EXERCISE, VESTING AND EXERCISE PRICE OF OPTION</U>. Subject to the terms hereof, the option herein granted must be exercised in whole or in part at any time or times prior to January 1, 2012. Subject to the terms hereof, the option herein granted shall become exercisable (i.e. shall vest) as to 3,125 shares of Common Stock on the last day of each calendar quarter ended on the last day of March, June, September and December commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and ending with the quarter ended December 31, 2002. The exercise price of the option shall be $0.86 per share, subject to adjustment as herein provided. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a), except as set forth below, such vesting is contingent upon the Optionee being a director of the Company as of any applicable vesting date, regardless of the reason that the Optionee may cease to be a director of the Company, and (b) subject to the restrictions herein as to when the option is exercisable, the Optionee shall have the right to select the portion of the option if and when the Optionee exercises any of this option.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a "Special Change in Control" (as herein defined) occurs, and whether or not Optionee continues as a director of the Company following the Effective Date (as herein defined) of such Special Change in Control, then, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, and without limitation, the Optionee will be fully vested with respect to all of the options then covered by this Agreement; such options will be exercisable at the exercise price set forth in the preceding paragraph as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, and will terminate as herein provided.<U> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>METHOD OF EXERCISE.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In order to exercise this option, in whole or in part, the Optionee shall deliver to the Company at its principal place of business, or at such other offices as shall be designated by the Company (i) a written notice of Optionee's election to exercise this option, which notice shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such exercise and (ii) either (A) cash or a check, payable to the order of the Company, equal to the option price, (B) notice that the exercise price is satisfied by reduction of the number of shares to be received by the Optionee upon exercise of this option as provided in Section 3(b) below, with the amount of such reduction specified in such notice, (C) shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the option price, or (D) a combination of the above; the option price shall be the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise involved. The Company shall undertake to make prompt delivery of the stock certificate(s) evidencing such part of the Shares, provided that if any law or regulation requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares specified in such notice before the issuance thereof, then the date of delivery of such Shares shall be extended for the period necessary to take such action. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>At the election of the Optionee, the Optionee may exercise this option without a cash payment of the exercise price by designating that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to Optionee upon such exercise shall be reduced by the number of shares having a fair market value equal to the amount of the option price for such exercise. In such instance, no cash or other consideration will be paid by the Optionee in connection with such exercise and no commission or other remuneration will be paid or given by the Optionee or the Company in connection with such exercise. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>For this purpose, the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock with respect to the exercise of an option shall be determined as of the last business day prior to such exercise of the option.</LI></P></OL>

To the extent not theretofore exercised, the option herein granted shall terminate on the earlier of (a) January 1, 2012, or (b) six (6) months from the date on which Optionee ceases to be a director of the Company for any reason other than death or disability of the Optionee, or (c) one (1) year from the date on which Optionee ceases to be a director of the Company if such event is due to the death or disability of the Optionee.</LI></P>
