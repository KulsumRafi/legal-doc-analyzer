<P>Exhibit I</U> - Litigation</P>
<P>Kenneth Schuck Trucking has claimed either directly or through a collection agency that it is due from SRP $29,138.00 from 1996 to 1997 primarily for unauthorized detention time relating to trucking charges.  SRP believes that these charges are invalid.  In some cases, the invoices for which claims were asserted had been paid, and SRP has so informed the claimant.  SRP has not established any reserve for this claim.</P>
<P>MCI WorldCom has invoiced SRP for approximately $10,800, which SRP disputes.  The charges span a period from the beginning of the contract (in excess of two (2) years) to the current period.  Repeated documented attempts via phone calls, e-mails, and faxes have been made to try to resolve this issue with MCI WorldCom, without success.  Periodic payments have been made, but the account remains past due according to the MCI WorldCom records.  Considering the situation of MCI WorldCom a full resolution may take time.  The disputed amount has not been reserved.</P>
