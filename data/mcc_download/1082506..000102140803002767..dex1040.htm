Company&#146;s Executive Severance Benefit Policy, and the Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement between you and the Company (the &#147;Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement&#148;). As we previously agreed, the terms set

shall pay to you an annual incentive cash award based upon a target which shall be fifty percent (50%) of your base salary, with the actual annual incentive cash award determined to be below, at, or above target, based upon the Company&#146;s
achievement level against the financial and performance objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Incentive Plan does not currently permit any payments until the Company is profitable. </FONT></P><P

Cause by the Company prior to September 30, 2003, notwithstanding any other severance benefits to which you are entitled, the Company shall promptly pay to you any remaining bonus payments provided for in the preceding paragraph that have not yet
