          1.   The Lenders hereby consent to the modification of the definition
of "Senior Subordinated Indenture" contained in the Senior Subordinated Credit

$35,000,000 provided in the Senior Subordinated Credit Agreement.

          2.   Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
inserting the text ", except to the extent such modifications or amendments are
determined by the Agents to be immaterial" immediately after the text "adversely
affect the interests of the Lenders" appearing in clause (i)(B) of said Section.

II.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

          1.   In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Amendment, each
Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and warrants that:

          (a)  no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Third Amendment
     Effective Date, both immediately before and immediately after giving effect
     to this Amendment; and

          (b)  all of the representations and warranties contained in the Credit
     Agreement or the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all
     material respects on the Third Amendment Effective Date both immediately
     before and immediately after giving effect to this Amendment, with the same
     effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and
     as of the Third Amendment Effective Date (it being understood that any
     representation or warranty made as of a specific date shall be true and
     correct in all material respects as of such specific date).

          2.   This Amendment is limited as specified and shall not constitute a
modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document.

          3.   This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with Holdings and the Administrative Agent.

Amendment Effective Date") when each Credit Agreement Party, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have signed a
counterpart hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have
delivered (including by way of facsimile transmission) the same to the
Administrative Agent at its Notice Office.

          6.   From and after the Third Amendment Effective Date, all references
in the Credit Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents to the Credit
Agreement shall be deemed to be references to the Credit Agreement as modified
hereby.
