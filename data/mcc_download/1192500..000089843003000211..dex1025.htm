Broker shall remain liable to Owner for the difference between the amount payable by Broker pursuant to Section 1 for the broadcast time comprising the Default Segment during the remainder of the term of the Agreement and the amount, if any,

for revenues from a Default Segment, all revenues and cash accounts receivable for broadcasts on the Station on or following the Effective Date shall belong to Broker. Broker may sell advertising time consistent with the applicable rules and
regulations and the Policy Statement (as defined below), on the Station in combination with any other broadcast station of its choosing, subject to compliance with applicable law. Broker shall be responsible for payment of the commissions due to any
national sales representative, local sales representative, agency or employee engaged by it for the purpose of selling advertising that is carried during the programming it provides to Owner. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, to the extent that Owner has received prepayment for advertising time for periods following the Effective Date, Owner shall disclose such prepayments to Broker on or prior to the Effective Date and such prepayments shall be deducted from
the amounts due to Owner pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement, but only in the event Broker airs such prepaid advertising. All information provided by Owner prior to the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, shall
accurately reflect all advertisements scheduled following the Effective Date. If advertisers whose advertisements air on the Station on or after the Effective Date make payments to Owner rather than to Broker with respect to such advertisements,
Owner shall hold such amounts in trust for Broker, shall promptly notify Broker of the receipt of such funds and shall forward such amounts to Broker within five (5) business days. If Owner fails to forward such amount to Broker within five (5)
business days, Broker shall have the right to set such amounts off against the payments due under Section 2 hereunder with amounts subsequently paid by Owner being reimbursed by Broker. </FONT></DIV>

of any programming, announcement, advertising or other matter that is slanderous, defamatory, obscene or indecent, as determined by a final, unappealable order of the FCC or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall constitute a material breach of
this Agreement, and shall entitle Owner, at its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement immediately and exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement based on such material breach by Broker, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6
