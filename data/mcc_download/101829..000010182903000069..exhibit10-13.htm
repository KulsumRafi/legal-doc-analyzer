<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION<br>
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN</b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.</b> The purpose of this Plan is to benefit
the shareowners of the Corporation by (i) encouraging high levels of performance by
employees of the Corporation by increasing the proprietary interests of such individuals
in the Corporation&#146;s growth and success; and (ii) recognizing those employees who
demonstrate outstanding performance and potential through Awards designed to strengthen
the relationship between the Corporation and such employees. To accomplish these
objectives, the Plan authorizes the Award of non-qualified stock options to employees of
the Corporation below the executive level whose efforts, responsibilities and long-term
potential enable these individuals to contribute to the long term success of the
Corporation. Stock Option Awards serve to recognize the performance and potential of such
employees, foster commitment to the Corporation and its long term goals and to reward such
individuals by sharing in any increase in the value of the Corporation&#146;s Common
Stock.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Plan shall be effective January 1, 1997.</p>

initiative and long-term potential enable them to contribute to the success of the
Corporation and the Business Units. Individuals who are employed in organizations which
are affiliated with the Corporation through partnership, joint venture, or other
arrangements involving financial and/or strategic collaboration whose efforts benefit the
Corporation are also eligible to participate herein. Individual Participants shall be
recommended by the Business Units, subject to the approval of the Chief Executive Officer.
Executives of the Corporation and any individual who is a reporting person of the
Corporation for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are not

<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. EXERCISE AND PAYMENT OF OPTIONS.</b>&nbsp; A Participant may acquire
shares of Common Stock by exercising his or her Stock Option Award, or portion thereof,
during a period beginning on the third anniversary of the Award Date and ending on the
tenth anniversary of the Award Date, unless the Expiration Date is accelerated as a result
of termination, death or retirement as set forth in Section 5 hereof. The Vesting Date and
Expiration Date are each set forth in the Statement of Award. The option to purchase
shares will expire without value with respect to any Stock Option that is not exercised on
or before the Expiration Date. It is the sole responsibility of the Participant, or the
Participant&#146;s representative, to exercise the Stock Option in a timely manner. The
Corporation assumes no responsibility for, and will make no adjustments with respect to
Stock Options that expire without value.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stock Options may be exercised through a security brokerage firm with
whom the Corporation has established an arrangement to facilitate Stock Option exercises.
After the Participant establishes a relationship with one of the pre-approved security
brokerage firms, the Participant may exercise Stock Options by notifying such broker of
the options to be exercised. On the exercise date the broker will sell shares of Common
Stock sufficient to cover the exercise price of the option plus any required tax
withholding amounts. The broker will then wire transfer funds back to the Corporation
equal to the exercise price and the required tax withholding amount. The Corporation will
then immediately deliver to the broker a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
number of options exercised. The shares remaining after payment of the exercise price and
tax withholding will at the Participant&#146;s election either: (i) be placed in the
Participant&#146;s account; or (ii) sold on the market with net cash proceeds delivered to
the Participant by the broker. No cash payment will be required to be paid to the broker
or to the Corporation by the Participant at any time during the Stock Option exercise
process. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. </b>A Stock Option that is vested as of
the date of a Participant&#146;s termination of employment may be exercised for a period
of 90 calendar days following the date of termination, but in no event beyond the
Expiration Date of the Stock Option. Stock Options which are not vested as of the
termination date will be canceled without value except as specifically provided for below.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a Participant&#146;s employment terminates by reason of retirement,
Stock Options that have been held at least one year as of the retirement date will become
exercisable on the original scheduled Vesting Date and may be exercised thereafter until
the third anniversary of the retirement date. Stock Options which are exercisable as of
the retirement date may continue to be exercised for a period up to the third anniversary
of the retirement date, but in no event beyond the Expiration Date of the Stock Option.
For purposes of this Plan, retirement shall have the same meaning as defined in the United
Technologies Corporation Retirement Plan and requires either: (i) attainment of age 65;
(ii) retirement on or after age 55 with at least 10 years of service; or (iii) termination
of employment between age 50 and 55 with a combination of age and service of at least 65
(i.e., the &quot;rule of 65&quot;).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of permanent and total disability, the Participant shall
not be considered to have terminated employment for purposes of the Stock Option Award
which shall become vested and exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Award
without regard to the disability. An authorized leave of absence shall not be treated as a
termination of employment if the Participant resumes active employment following such
leave of absence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of the death of the Participant, the legal representative
of the estate of the Participant may exercise all Stock Options outstanding as of the date
of death, whether or not vested, for a period of one year following the date of death,
regardless of the Expiration Date of the Stock Option.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Participant terminates employment for any reason other than
death, disability or retirement, all non-vested Stock Options will be forfeited effective
as of the termination date.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SHARES. </b>The number of shares with
respect to which Stock Option Awards may be issued for any calendar year shall not exceed
one million shares of Common Stock. This limitation shall be subject to adjustment as
provided for in Section 10 hereof.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. </b>The Committee reserves the right to
amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan at any time or to alter or to amend any Award under
the Plan to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8. ADMINISTRATION. </b>Awards under this Plan shall be granted subject
to the review and approval of the Chief Executive Officer. All questions of interpretation
and administration with respect to the Plan and Awards thereunder shall be determined by
the Senior Vice President, Human Resources and Organization or his successor, and his
determination shall be final and conclusive upon all parties and interest.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS. </b>If the Corporation effects a subdivision
or consolidation of shares of Common Stock or other capital adjustment, the payment of a
stock dividend or other increase or reduction of the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding without receiving consideration therefore in money, services or property, the
number of shares of Common Stock then remaining subject to this Plan and outstanding
Awards and the maximum number of shares that may be issued under this Plan shall: (a) in
the event of an increase in the number of outstanding shares, the number of shares subject
to an Award shall be proportionately increased and the exercise price for each share then
covered by an outstanding Award shall be proportionately reduced, and (b) in the event of
a reduction in the number of outstanding shares, be proportionately reduced and the price
for each share then covered by an outstanding Award shall be proportionately increased.
The maximum number of shares that may be subject to an Award in any given year shall be
increased or decreased to reflect the subdivision, consolidation or other capital
adjustment. In addition, in such circumstances, the Committee shall make such adjustments
to Awards under the Plan as the Committee deems appropriate.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10. CHANGE OF CONTROL. </b>In the event of a change of control of the
Corporation, or if the Board reaches agreement to merge or consolidate with another
company and the Corporation is not the surviving Corporation or if all, or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation are sold, or if the Corporation shall make a
distribution to shareowners that is non-taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, or if the
Corporation shall dissolve or liquidate (a &quot;Restructuring Event&quot;), then the
Committee may, in its discretion, recommend that the Board take any of the following
actions as a result of, or in anticipation of, any such Restructuring Event to assure fair
and equitable treatment of Plan Participants:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) accelerate time periods for purposes of vesting in, or realizing
  gain from, any outstanding Award made pursuant to this Plan;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) offer to purchase any outstanding Award made pursuant to this Plan
  from the holder for its equivalent cash value, as determined by the Committee, as of the
  date of the Restructuring Event; and</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) make adjustments or modifications to outstanding Awards as the
  Committee deems appropriate to maintain and protect the rights and interests of Plan
  Participants following such Restructuring Event. Any such action by the Board shall be
  conclusive and binding on the Corporation and all Plan Participants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For purposes of this Section, &quot;Change of Control&quot; shall mean:
(i) the acquisition by any person of voting shares of the Corporation if, as a result of
the acquisition, such person, or any &quot;group&quot; as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of which such person is a part, owns at least 20% of
the outstanding voting shares of the Corporation; or (ii) a change in the composition of
the Board such that within any period of two consecutive years, persons who (a) at the
beginning of such period constitute the Board or (b) become directors after the beginning
of such period and whose election, or nomination for election by the shareowners of the
Corporation, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the persons who were either
directors at the beginning of such period or whose subsequent election or nomination was
previously approved in accordance with this clause (b), cease to constitute at least a
majority of the Board.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11. NON-ASSIGNABILITY. </b>No assignment or transfer of any interest of
the Participant in any of the rights represented by any Award hereunder whether voluntary
or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise shall be permitted except by will or by
the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempt to assign such interests shall be void
and shall be without force or effect.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12. AWARDS NOT TO AFFECT OR BE AFFECTED BY CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. </b>Neither
the Plan nor the Awards hereunder shall affect in any way the right or power of the
Corporation or its shareowners to make or authorize: (a) any or all adjustments,
recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Corporation's capital structure
or its business; (b) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation; (c) any issue of
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks holding any priority or preferred

rights of the holders of such Common Stock; (d) the dissolution or liquidation of the
Corporation; (e) any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business; or (f)

Plan and any Award hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be mailed to or delivered to
the party for whom it is intended at such address as may from time to time be designated
by such party or through electronic delivery at the Participant&#146;s internal electronic

<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14. TAXES/WITHHOLDING. </b>The Participant shall be responsible for any
income or other tax liability attributable to amounts realized from Awards. The
Corporation shall take such steps as are appropriate to assure compliance with applicable
federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. The Corporation shall, to the
extent required by law, have the right to withhold shares from a Stock Option exercise or
to deduct directly from any payment due the Participant or from the Participant's regular
compensation, all federal, state and local taxes of any kind (including taxes imposed by
international tax authorities with requisite jurisdiction) required by law to be withheld
with respect to value realized upon the exercise of a Stock Option.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15. RIGHT OF DISCHARGE RESERVED. </b>Nothing in this Plan or in any
Award granted hereunder shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue in the
employment or service of the Corporation or any Business Unit for any period of time or
affect any right that the Corporation or a Business Unit may have to terminate the
employment or service of such Participant at any time for any reason.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16. RIGHT OF CORPORATION TO REVOKE AWARDS.</b>&nbsp; Notwithstanding
any other provision herein, the Corporation reserves the right, prior to a Change of
Control of the Corporation, to cancel any Award, whether or not vested, if the Senior Vice
