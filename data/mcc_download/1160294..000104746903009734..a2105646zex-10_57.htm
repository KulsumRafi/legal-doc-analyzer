<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Code of Ethics for President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers (collectively, "Executives"), is designed to provide principles for
the Executives to follow in conducting the business of the Company. The Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company
policy requires that its Executives observe the highest standards of business and personal ethics in the fulfillment of their duties and responsibilities to the Company.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>The Code  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve the purposes set forth above, we have adopted the following principles and policies: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with Laws and Regulations.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Executive has an obligation to comply with the applicable laws, rules and
regulations governing the Company's business. We will not tolerate any activity that violates any laws, rules or regulations applicable to us. Whenever a question arises with respect to the
applicability or interpretation of any law, rule or regulation pertaining to the Company's business, the Executive shall consult with the Company's General Counsel or outside counsel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prohibition against legal and Ethical Violations.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives shall not knowingly participate in, or assist, any acts which
are in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation governing the Company's business, nor any act that would violate any provision of this Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiduciary duties.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executives have certain fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders. They shall exercise
particular care in complying with these duties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts of Interest.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives must fully disclose to the Board of Directors any situations, including situations
involving immediate family members, that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. A conflict situation can arise when an Executive takes actions or has interests that may
make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. A conflict of interest may exist when a Executive's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in
any way with the interests of the Company as a whole. The following are examples of situations (applicable to both an Executive or family member) that may present a conflict of interest: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate Opportunities.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Executive Officer that discovers a business opportunity that is in our line of business must
first present the business opportunity to our Board of Directors before pursuing the activity in his or her individual capacity. If the Board of Directors waives our right to pursue the opportunity,
then the Executive Officer may do so in his or her individual capacity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition and Fair Dealing.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Executives are obligated to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers and competitors.
Executives will not take unfair advantage of any person or entity through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation or any other unfair dealing or practice. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company Records.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives should implement policies that will ensure that all company records are complete, accurate and
reliable in all material respects. All of the Company's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Compmapny's
transactions and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company's system of internal controls. Company records include bookkeeping information, payroll, e-mails,
accounting and financial data, measurement and performance records, electronic data files and all other records maintained in the ordinary course of our business. Executives are responsible for
understanding and complying with our document retention policy. </FONT></P>

thoroughness in the preparation and review of the financial records and reports of the Company. The Executives must also ensure full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other
public communications made by the Company. Executives should be on guard for, and promptly report, evidence of improper financial reporting. Executives must be aware of the requirements of Regulation
FD and must make every effort to ensure that our public disclosures comply with those requirements. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with Insider Trading Laws.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives are strictly prohibited from trading in our stock or other securities, or
the stock or other securities of any other company, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the company or the other company. In addition, Executives are strictly prohibited from
recommending, "tipping" or suggesting that anyone else buy or sell our stock or other securities, or the stock or securities of any other company, on the basis of material, nonpublic information. For
more information, please refer to our securities trading policy and procedures. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Reporting Violations of the Code  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executives have a duty to report any known or suspected violation of this Code, including any violation of laws, rules, regulations or policies applicable to us,
to the General Counsel, or his designee. If the Executive does not feel comfortable reporting the conduct to the General Counsel, or his designee or does not get a satisfactory response, he or she may
contact any member of the Board of Directors. </FONT></P>
