AGENT"), Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated

respective capacities as such, each, an "ARRANGER" and, collectively, the

AGENT").

     The Borrower has requested the Lenders to provide the credit facility
hereinafter described in the amounts and on the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Lenders have so agreed on the terms and conditions set forth herein,
and the Administrative Agent has agreed to act as administrative agent for the
Lenders, on such terms and conditions;

     Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
specified below:

          "ABR BORROWING" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

          "ABR LOAN" shall mean any Loan bearing interest at a rate determined
     by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the provisions
     of Article II or any Eurodollar Loan converted (pursuant to Section 2.08 or
     2.13(a)(ii)) to a loan bearing interest at a rate determined by reference
     to the Alternate Base Rate.

          "ACQUISITION DATE" shall mean the date as of which a person or group
     of related persons first acquires more than 30% of any outstanding class of
     Voting Shares of TXU (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
     Exchange Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder).

          "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT" shall have the meaning given such term in the
     preamble hereto.

          "AFFILIATE" shall mean, when used with respect to a specified person,
     another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or
     is under common control with the person specified.

          "AGREEMENT" shall have the meaning given such term in the preamble
     hereto.

          "ALTERNATE BASE RATE" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum
     (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the
     greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus
     0.50% and (ii)'the Prime Rate in effect on such day. For purposes hereof,
     "PRIME RATE" shall mean the rate of interest publicly announced by the
     Administrative Agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in

     New York City, as in effect from time to time; and "FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE
     RATE" shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates on
     overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve
     System arranged by Federal funds brokers, as released on the next
     succeeding Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if
     such rate is not so released for any day which is a Business Day, the
     arithmetic average (rounded upwards to the next 1/100th of 1%), as
     determined by the Administrative Agent, of the quotations for the day of
     such transactions received by the Administrative Agent from three Federal
     funds brokers of recognized standing selected by it. If for any reason the
     Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the Administrative Agent
     shall, upon request, provide to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in
     reasonable detail the basis for such determination) that it is unable to
     ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate for any reason, including the
     inability of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in
     accordance with the terms thereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall be
     determined without regard to clause (i) of the first sentence of this
     definition until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer
     exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime
     Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the
     effective date of such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds
     Effective Rate, respectively.

     provided that the Applicable Margin as to any Eurodollar Borrowing shall in
     no event be less than 3.00% per annum and (b) as to any ABR Loan, a rate
     per annum that is 1.00% less than (i) during, the first three months such
     ABR Loan is outstanding, the Applicable Margin that would be applicable
     during the first Interest Period (with a duration of three months) as to a
     Eurodollar Borrowing that occurred on the same day as such ABR Loan was
     made or, as the case may be, a Eurodollar Loan was converted into such ABR
     Loan and (~i) during each successive three-month period to occur
     thereafter, the Applicable Margin that would be applicable during such
     three-month period as to a Eurodollar Borrowing(having an Interest Period
     with a duration of three months) that occurred on the first', day of such

and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.
The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed
by the phrase "without limitation." All references herein to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections of,
and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise
require. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an
accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in
effect from time to time; provided, however, that for purposes of determining
compliance with any covenant set forth in Article V, such terms shall be
construed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date hereof applied on a
basis consistent with the application used in preparing the Borrower's audited
financial statements referred to in Section 3.05.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE CREDITS

     SECTION 2.01.  COMMITMENTS.

     Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations
and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly,
to make Loans to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time until the last
day of the Borrowing Period or the prior termination of the Commitment of such
Lender, in an amount up to the amount of such Lender's Commitment in effect at
such time.

     Amounts borrowed and repaid by the Borrower hereunder may not be
reborrowed.

     SECTION 2.02.  LOANS.

     (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in
itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being
understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). The
Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is
an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 (or, if such
Borrowing is comprised solely of ABR Loans and the total Commitments then in
effect are less than $25,000,000, an aggregate principal amount equal to the
Total Commitments then in effect).


<PAGE>


                                                                              15


     (b) Each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Eurodollar Loans or ABR
Loans, as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at
its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type
may be outstanding at the same time.

     (c) Subject to paragraph (d) below, each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent in New York, New York,
not later than noon, New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall by
2:00 p.m., New York City time, credit the amounts so received to the account or
accounts specified from time to time in one or more notices delivered by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such
date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met,
return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders. Loans shall be made by
the Lenders pro rata in accordance with Section 2.14. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent
such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on
the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this paragraph (c), and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent,
such Lender and the Borrower (without waiving any claim against such Lender for
such Lender's failure to make such portion available) severally agree to repay
to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall
repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

     (d) The Borrower may refinance all or any part of any Borrowing with a
Borrowing of the same or a different Type, subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement. Any Borrowing or part thereof so
refinanced shall be deemed to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with Section
2.05 or 2.10, as applicable, with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and the
proceeds of the new Borrowing, to the extent they do not exceed the principal
amount of the Borrowing being refinanced, shall not be paid by the Lenders to
the Agent or by the Agent to the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (c) above.

     SECTION 2.03.  BORROWING PROCEDURE.

     In order to request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall hand deliver or
telecopy (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed by telecopy) to the
Administrative Agent a duly completed Borrowing Notice in the form of Exhibit A
(a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before such Borrowing, and (b) in the case of an
ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before such Borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case


<PAGE>


                                                                              16


specify (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurodollar
Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day) and the amount thereof; (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a
Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto, which shall not
end after the Termination Date; and (iv) remittance instructions for such
Borrowing. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such
notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest
Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice,
then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month's duration (subject to the limitations set forth in the definition of
"Interest Period"). If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance
with this Section 2.03 of its election to refinance a Borrowing prior to the end
of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, then the Borrower shall
(unless such Borrowing is repaid at the end of such Interest Period) be deemed
to have given notice of an election to refinance such Borrowing with an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no Borrowing shall be requested if the Interest Period with respect
thereto would end after the Termination Date. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03
and of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.04.  Fees.

any time during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding
the Termination Date.

     (b) Except as provided for in Section 2.09(d), the Commitment Fee shall be
payable in arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, September and
December and on the Termination Date, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent for distribution among the Lenders. The Commitment Fee paid
to the Administrative Agent shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent
among the Lenders ratably according to the respective amounts of the Commitments
of such Lenders. Once paid, no part of the Commitment Fee shall be refundable
under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.05.  REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS.

     (a) The outstanding principal balance of each Loan shall be due and
payable, and the Borrower unconditionally promises to pay such outstanding
principal balance, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and
on the Termination Date.

     (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such Lender resulting from
each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under
this Agreement.

     (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type of each Loan made
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each

                                                                              17


Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

     (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this Section 2.05 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

     SECTION 2.06.  INTEREST ON LOANS.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Loans comprising each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the
LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Margin from time to time in effect.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Loans comprising each
ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of (i) 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for periods
during which the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime
Rate and (ii) 360 days for other periods) at a rate per annum equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin from time to time in effect.

     (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable, and the Borrower
unconditionally promises to pay such interest, on each Interest Payment Date
applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each Interest Period or day
within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error; provided that the Administrative Agent shall, upon request, provide to
the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination.

     SECTION 2.07.  DEFAULT INTEREST.

     (a) If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of any
Loan hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment,
acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time from
the Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed as provided in Section
2.06) equal to the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to
the provisions of Section 2.06 plus 2%.

     (b) If the Borrower shall default in the payment of any interest on any
Loan or any other amount becoming due hereunder (other than the principal of any
Loan), whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration or
otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the
Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed as provided in
Section 2.06(b)) equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for
ABR Loans plus 2%.


                                      18

generally available in the London interbank market or (ii) that reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give telecopy notice of such determination to
the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under
clause (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.03 shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. In the event
the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the rates at which
dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans during such
Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such
notice, and ntil the Required Lenders shall have advised the Administrative
Agent that the circumstances ving rise to such notice no longer exist, any
request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowin shall be deemed a request for
an ABR Borrowing. Each determination by the Administrative, Agent hereunder
shall be made in good faith and shall be conclusive absent manifest error;
provided that the Administrative Agent, shall, upon request, provide to the
Borrower certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination.

     SECTION 2.09.  TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

Commitment sha 1 be in an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and in a minimum
principal amount of $10,000,000 d (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be
made that would reduce the Total Commitment to an amount less than $50,000,000,
unless the result of such termination or reduction is to reduce the Total
Commitment to $0. The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of any
notice given pursuant to this Section 2.09(c) and of each Lender's portion of
any such termination or reduction of the Total Commitment.

     (d) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of

prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) before 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, one Business Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans;
provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is
an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000.

     (b) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shal1 be
irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing (or portion
thereof) by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. All
prepayments under this Section 2.10 shall be subject to Section 8.05 but
otherwise without premium or penalty. All prepayments under this Section 2.10
shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid
to the date of payment.

     SECTION 2.11.  MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS AND COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS.

     (a) Unless the Required Lenders and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, if
any Capital Stock shall be issued or sold, or Indebtedness (other than in
respect of Qualified Transition Bonds or commercial paper) incurred, by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than to any Affiliate of
the Borrower, then on the date of such issuance or sale, an amount equal to 100%
of the Net Proceeds thereof shall be applied by the Borrower toward the
prepayment of the Loans and/or credited to the reduction of the Total
Commitments in effect on such date as set forth in Section 2.11(c).

     (b) Unless the Required Lenders and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, if

Section 2.11(c) by an amount equal, to 100% of the amount of such Net Proceeds.

     (c) Amounts to be applied to prepayments or credited to Commitment
reductions made pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section shall be
applied, first, to the prepayment of the Loans until all the Loans outstanding
immediately prior to such prepayment, if any, have been repaid in full and,
second, to reduce permanently the Total Commitments.

     SECTION 2.12.  RESERVE REQUIREMENTS; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.

      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender hereunder
(except for changes in respect of taxes on the overall net income of such Lender
or its lending office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's
principal executive office or lending office is located), or shall result in the
imposition, modification or applicability of any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or
credit extended by any Lender or shall result in the imposition on any Lender or


<PAGE>


                                                                              20


the London interbank market of any other condition affecting this Agreement,
such Lender's Commitment or any Loan (other than an ABR Loan) made by such
Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (other than an ABR Loan) or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender
to be material, then the Borrower shall, upon receipt of the notice and
certificate provided for in Section 2.12(c), promptly pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional
costs incurred or reduction suffered.

     (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any law, rule,
regulation or guideline arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle
Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards," or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of
such Lender) or any Lender's holding company with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, such
Lender's Commitment or the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto to a level
below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then from time to time such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for any such reduction suffered will be paid to such Lender by the
Borrower. It is acknowledged that this Agreement is being entered into by the
Lenders on the understanding that the Lenders will not be required to maintain
capital against their Commitments under currently applicable laws, regulations
and regulatory guidelines. In the event the Lenders shall otherwise determine
that such understanding is incorrect, it is agreed that the Lenders, will be
entitled to make claims under this paragraph (b) based upon market requirements
prevailing on the date hereof for commitments under comparable credit facilities
against which capital is required to be maintained.

     (c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as
shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company as specified
in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and containing an explanation
in reasonable detail of the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have
been determined, shall be delivered to the Borrower, and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender the amount shown as
due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of
the same. Each Lender shall give prompt notice to the Borrower of any event of
which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, that it has determined
will require compensation by the Borrower pursuant to this Section; provided,
however, that failure by such Lender to give such notice shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation hereunder.

     (d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in


<PAGE>


                                                                              21


return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any
other period; provided, however, that no Lender shall be entitled to
compensation under this Section 2.12 for any costs incurred or reductions
suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the Borrower
that it will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under
paragraph (c) above not more than 90 days after the later of (i) such date and
(ii) the date on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions.
The protection of this Section shall be available to each Lender regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule,
regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall have occurred or
been imposed.

     (e) The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

     (f) Each Lender agrees that it will designate a different lending office if
such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender.

     SECTION 2.13.  CHANGE IN LEGALITY.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

          (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such
     Lender hereunder, whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall,
     as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such
     declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (any Lender delivering such a
     declaration hereby agreeing to withdraw such declaration promptly upon
     determining that such event of illegality no longer exists); and

          (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
     converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
     automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
     notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a
day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be
required pursuant to Section 8.05(b).

     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice by any Lender shall be
effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest
Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such

     SECTION 2.14.  PRO RATA TREATMENT.

     Except as required under Sections 2.13 and 2.18, each Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of the Loans, each payment of interest on the
Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fee, each reduction of the Commitments and
each refinancing or conversion of any Borrowing with a Borrowing of any Type,
shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been
terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their Loans).
Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to
be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each
Lender's percentage of such Loan to the next higher or lower whole dollar
amount.

     SECTION 2.15.  SHARING OF SETOFFS.

     Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in
respect of any Loans as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its
Loans shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the
Loans of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased
from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other
Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans of such other
Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and
participations in the Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion
to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the
principal amount of its Loans prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding
prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event;
provided, however, that, if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall
be made pursuant to this Section 2.15 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a
Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing
by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had
made a Loan in the amount of such participation.

     SECTION 2.16.  PAYMENTS.

     (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or
interest on any Loan or the Commitment Fee or other amounts) hereunder from an
account in the United States not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
the date when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office,
in immediately available funds. Each such payment shall be made without off-set,
deduction or counterclaim, provided, that the foregoing shall not constitute a
relinquishment or waiver of the Borrower's rights to any independent claim that
the Borrower may have against the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                                                                              23


     (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Loan or
the Commitment Fee or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise
would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or the Commitment Fee, if applicable.

     SECTION 2.17.  TAXES.

     (a) Any and all payments of principal and interest on any of the
outstanding Loans, or of the Commitment Fee or indemnity or expense
reimbursements by the Borrower hereunder ("BORROWER PAYMENTS") shall be made, in
accordance with Section 2.16, free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all current or future United States Federal, state and local taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
to such Borrower Payments, but only to the extent reasonably attributable to
such Borrower Payments, excluding (i) income taxes imposed on the net income of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any transferee or assignee thereof,
including a participation holder (any such entity a "TRANSFEREE")) and (ii)
franchise taxes imposed on the net income of the Administrative Agent, or any
Lender (or Transferee), in each case by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) is organized or doing
business through offices or branches located therein, or any political
subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively or individually, "TAXES").
If the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder to any Lender (or any Transferee) orj the Administrative
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount (an "ADDITIONAL
AMOUNT") necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable jto additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) such
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall
receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant United States
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any current or future
st p or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or oth rwise with respect to, this Agreement
("OTHER TAXES").

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender (or Transferee thereof) and
the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes with
respect to Borrower Payments paid by such person, and any liability (including
penalties (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly
or legally asserted by the relevant United States Governmental Authority. A
certificate setting forth an in reasonable detail of the manner in which such
amount shall have been determined and the amount of such payment or liability
prepared by a Lender or the Administrative Agent on their behalf, absent
manifest error, shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such
indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

                                                                              24


     (d) If a Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Age shall become
aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a United States Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
by the Borrower, or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional
amounts, pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall promptly notify the Borrower
of the availability of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt
of a request by the Borrower, make a claim to such United States Governmental
Authority for such refund at the Borrower's expense. If a Lender (or Transferee)
of the Administrative Agent receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for
refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to
which the Borrower had paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it
shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the
Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent and without interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant United States Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the
request of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent agrees to
repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other
charges) to such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent in the event
such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay
such refund to such United States Governmental Authority.

     (e) As soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days, after the date
of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to the relevant United
States Governmental Authority, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.01, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such United States Governmental Authority evidencing
payment thereof.

     (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained
herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.17 shall
survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans
hereunder.

     (g) Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (or Transferee) that
is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, any
State thereof or the District of Columbia (a "NON-U.S. LENDER" or "NON U.S.
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT", as applicable) shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, properly completed and duly executed by such
Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, United
States Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement.
Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a
participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a
Transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U.S. Lender
changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office
(a "New Lending Office"). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such
forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously
delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.17(g), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form
pursuant to this Section 2.17(g) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able
to deliver.

     (h) The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender or
Non-U.S. Administrative Agent (including any Transferee), or to pay any
additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender or Non-U.S. Administrative Agent
(including any Transferee), in respect of United States Federal, state or local
withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that (i)
the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States Federal, state
or local withholding tax existed on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party
to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation
holder, on the date such participation holder became a Transferee hereunder) or,
with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Non-U.S. Lender
designated such New Lending Office with respect to an Loan; provided, however,
that this clause (h) shall not apply to any Transferee or New Lending Office
that becomes a Transferee or New Lending Office as a result of an assignment,
participation, transfer or designation made at the request of the Borrower; and
provided further, however, that this clause (h) shall not apply to the extent
the indemnity payment or additional amounts any Transferee, or any Lender (or
Transferee) through a New Lending Office, would be entitled to receive (without
regard to this clause (h)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional
amounts that the person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such
Transferee, or such Lender (or Transferee) making the designation of such New
Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such
assignment, participation, transfer or designation or (ii) the obligation to pay
such additional amounts or such indemnity payments would not have arisen but for
a failure by such Non-U.S. Lender (including any Transferee) to comply with the
provisions of paragraph (g) above and paragraph (i) below.

     (i) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any indemnity payment or additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or
document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or
change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity
payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
good faith determination of such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

     (j) Nothing contained in this Section 2.17 shall require any Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent to make available to the Borrower any of
its tax returns (or any other information) that it deems to be confidential or
proprietary.

     SECTION 2.18.  ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

     In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate
pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.13, or the Borrower shall be required to make
additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.17, the Borrower shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.04) all
such Lender's interests, rights and obligations contained hereunder to another
financial institution approved by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) which shall assume such
obligations; provided that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law,
rule or regulation or order of any Governmental Authority and (ii) the assignee
shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately available funds on the date of
such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on
the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or

owed to it hereunder, and the Borrower shall pay the processing and recordation
fee due pursuant to Section 8.04 and any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 8.05(b).

                                   ARTICLE VII
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Credit Suisse First Boston is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on
behalf of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf of such Lender and to
exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms and provisions hereof and of the Delivery Agreement, together with
such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders
hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each
payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each Lender to the Borrower
of any Event of Default of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge
acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each
Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered
by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as received by the Administrative
Agent.

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
the Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein and in the Delivery Agreement, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or the Delivery Agreement or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent.

     Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by
any of them except for its or his or her own gross negligence or willful
misconduct, or be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation
herein or in the Delivery Agreement or the contents of any document delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any
inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of the
terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the Delivery
Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders for
the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of
this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement or other instruments or agreements. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender that makes any Loan as the
holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof and of
the Delivery Agreement until it shall have received notice from such Lender,
given as provided herein, of the transfer thereof. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in
accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except
as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the Delivery Agreement, such
instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the
contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or document believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the
Borrower on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any
Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or under the Delivery Agreement or to
any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any
other Lender or the Borrower of any of their respective obligations hereunder or
under the Delivery Agreement or in connection herewith or therewith. The

                                                                              42


Administrative Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder or under the
Delivery Agreement by or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to
rely upon the advice of legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters
arising hereunder or thereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or
suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

     The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be
under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement unless it
shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent
acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Delivery Agreement. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 8.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

     With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent,
in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent, shall have the same
rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof
as if it were not Administrative Agent.

     Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative Agent, on demand, in
the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment hereunder or, if the
Commitments shall have been terminated, the amount of its percentage of the then
outstanding Loans) of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders, in
its role as Administrative Agent, including counsel fees and compensation of
agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which
shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower and (ii) to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees
or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any
and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement or
any action taken or omitted by it under this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement
to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided
that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or


<PAGE>


                                                                              43


willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its directors,
officers, employees or agents. Each Lender agrees that any allocation made in
good faith by the Administrative Agent of expenses or other amounts referred to
in this paragraph shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

     ML and CSFB shall not, by virtue of their respective designations as
Arranger, and ML shall not, by virtue of its designation as Syndication Agent,
have any duties, liabilities, obligations or responsibilities under this
Agreement other than, if applicable, as a Lender hereunder.

                                                                              44


shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans regardless of

     SECTION 8.04.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     (a) Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to,

successors and assigns.

     (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and its Loans); provided, however, that (i) except in
the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, an assignment
to a Federal Reserve Bank or an assignment made at any time an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower, each Arranger and the
Administrative Agent must give their prior written consent to such assignment
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) unless otherwise agreed
by the Borrower, the Arrangers and Administrative Agent, except in the case of
an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the amount of the
Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$1,000,000 or, if the amount of the Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender
is less than $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment and
Loans, (iii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, and a processing and

from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance,
which effective date shall be at least five Business Days after the execution
thereof unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent (the Borrower to be

                                                                              45


hereto (but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.17
and 8.05 afforded to such Lender prior to its assignment as well as to the
Commitment Fee accrued for its account hereunder and not yet paid)).

     (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning
Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such
assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, (ii) except
as set forth in (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto or the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignor and such
assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.03 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning
Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in the
City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans of, each Lender pursuant to
the terms hereof from time to time (the "RE ISTER"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
by the Borrower and each Lender (with respect to such Lender's Loans), at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) above and, if required, the written consent of the
Borrower, and the Administrative Agent to such assignment, the Administrative
Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register.

     (f) Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
in all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and its Loans); provided, however,


<PAGE>


                                                                              46

that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) each participating bank or other
entity shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection provisions
contained in Sections 2.12, 2.17 and 8.05 to the same extent as if it were the
selling Lender (and limited to the amount that could have been claimed by the
selling Lender had it continued to hold the interest of such participating bank
or other entity), except that all claims made pursuant to such Sections shall be
made through such selling Lender, and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such selling Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than
amendments, modifications or waivers of the types referred to in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) of Section 8.08(b)).

     (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section,
disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any
information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of
the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, each such assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute an agreement
whereby such assignee or participant shall agree (subject to customary
exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of any such information.

     (h) The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any rights and duties
hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders, and any attempted
assignment or delegation (except as a consequence of a transaction expressly
permitted under Section 5.09) by the Borrower without such consent shall be
void.

     (i) Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge
shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
Bank for such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes evidencing the Loans made to the Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

     SECTION 8.05.  EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by
the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Delivery Agreement or in connection with any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (but
only if such amendments, modifications or waivers are requested by the Borrower)
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated are consummated), or
incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
enforcement of their rights in connection herewith or with the Delivery
Agreement (including in respect of workouts and restructurings) or in connection
with the Loans made hereunder, including the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Administrative Agent or, in the case of enforcement following
an Event of Default, the Lenders.

                                                                              47


     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against any loss,
calculated in accordance with the next sentence, or reasonable expense that such
Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) any failure by the Borrower
to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan hereunder (including as
a result of the Borrower's failure to fulfill any of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article IV) after irrevocable notice of such borrowing,
refinancing, conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03,
(ii) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan of the Borrower,
or assignment of a Eurodollar Loan of the Borrower required by any other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made, on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (iii) any
default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part
thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due
date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of
prepayment or otherwise) or (iv) the occurrence of any Event of Default relating
to the Borrower, including, in each such case, any loss or reasonable expense
sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred by such Lender in
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, or with respect to
commitments made or obligations undertaken with third parties, to effect or
maintain any Loan hereunder or any part thereof as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss
shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by
such Lender, of (x) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid,
prepaid, refinanced, converted or not borrowed (assumed to be the LIBO Rate for
the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, refinancing or failure to
borrow or refinance to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow or refinance, the Interest Period for such Loan
that would have commenced on the date of such failure)) over (y) the amount of
interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by
such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid or not borrowed or
refinanced for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be.

     (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender,
each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and agents of
the foregoing (each such person being called an Indemnitee") against, and to
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all costs, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
preparation, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of
this Agreement and the Delivery Agreement, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the
Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
including any of the foregoing arising from the negligence, whether sole or
concurrent, on the part of any Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses (i) are determined by a final,
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (ii)
result from any litigation brought by such Indemnitee against the Borrower or by
the Borrower against such Indemnitee, in which a final, nonappealable judgment
has been rendered against such Indemnitee; provided, further, that the Borrower
agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, without the prior
written consent of each Indemnitee, settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding
in respect of which indemnification could be sought under the indemnification
provisions of this Section 8.05(c) (whether or not any Indemnitee is an actual
or potential party to such claim, action, suit or proceeding), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to an
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any

                                                                              48


Indemnitee and does not involve any payment of money or other value by
any Indemnitee or any injunctive relief or factual findings or stipulations
binding on any Indemnitee.

     (d) The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in full force
and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Delivery
Agreement, the repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability
of any term or provision hereof or of the Delivery Agreement or any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
All amounts due under this Section shall be payable on written demand therefor.

     (e) A certificate of any Lender or the Administrative Agent setting forth
any amount or amounts that such Lender or such Administrative Agent is entitled
to receive pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section and containing an
explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which such amount or amounts
shall have been determined shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

     SECTION 8.06.  Right of Setoff.

     If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender
is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at
any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing hereunder or under the Delivery Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

     SECTION 8.07.  APPLICABLE LAW.

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     SECTION 8.08.  WAIVERS; AMENDMENT.

     (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
exercising any power or right hereunder or under the Delivery Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision hereof or of the Delivery Agreement or consent to any departure
herefrom or therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice or demand on the Borrower or any Subsidiary in any case shall entitle
such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

                                                                              49


     (b) Neither this Agreement nor the Delivery Agreement nor any provision of
either thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall (i) decrease the
principal amount of, or extend the maturity of or any scheduled principal
payment date or date for the payment of any interest on, any Loan or date for
the payment of the Commitment Fee, or waive or excuse any such payment or any
part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan without the prior
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) increase the Commitment of
any Lender or decrease the Commitment Fee payable to any Lender without the
prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) amend or modify the provisions of
Section 2.13, 2.14 or Section 8.04(h), the provisions of this Section or the
definition of the "Required Lenders", without the prior written consent of each
Lender, or (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral Bonds held by
the Administrative Agent (other than an express release thereof pursuant to the
terms of Section 8.16) without the prior written consent of each Lender;
provided further, however, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall
be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section and
any consent by any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section
shall bind any assignee of its rights and interests hereunder.

     SECTION 8.09.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

     This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto) represents the
entire contract among the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Any previous agreement, whether written or oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, is superseded by this Agreement. There are
no unwritten oral agreements between the parties. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the
parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.10.  SEVERABILITY.

     In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

     SECTION 8.11.  COUNTERPARTS.

     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in
Section 8.03.

                                                                              50


     SECTION 8.12.  HEADINGS.

     Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting,
this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.13.  INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
applicable interest rate, together with all fees and charges which are treated
as interest under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), as provided for
herein or in any other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise
contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable on the Loans of such Lender
together with all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate.

     (b) If the amount of interest, together with all Charges, payable for the
account of any Lender in respect of any interest computation period is reduced
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section and the amount of interest, together
with all Charges, payable for such Lender's account in respect of any subsequent
interest computation period, computed pursuant to Section 2.07, would be less
than the Maximum Rate, then the amount of interest, together with all Charges,
payable for such Lender's account in respect of such subsequent interest
computation period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
automatically increased to such Maximum Rate; provided that at no time shall the
aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender has been
increased pursuant to this paragraph (b) exceed the aggregate amount by which
interest, together with all Charges, paid for its account has theretofore been
reduced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section.

     SECTION 8.14.  JURISDICTION; VENUE.

     (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Subject to the foregoing and to paragraph (b) below, nothing in
this Agreement shall affect any right that any party hereto may otherwise have
to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Delivery
Agreement against any other party hereto in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or thereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Delivery Agreement in any


<PAGE>


                                                                              51


New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York City. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     SECTION 8.15.  CONFIDENTIALITY.

     Each Lender shall use its best efforts to hold in confidence all
information, memoranda, or extracts furnished to such Lender (directly or
through the Administrative Agent) by the Borrower hereunder or in connection
with the negotiation hereof; provided that such Lender may disclose any such
information, memoranda or extracts (i) to its Affiliates, accountants or
counsel, (ii) to any regulatory agency having authority to examine such Lender,
(iii) as required by any legal or governmental process or otherwise by law, (iv)
except as provided in the last sentence of Section 5.03, to any person to which
such Lender sells or proposes to sell an assignment or a participation in its
Loans hereunder, if such other person agrees for the benefit of the Borrower to
comply with the provisions of this Section and (v) to the extent that such
information, memoranda or extracts shall be publicly available or shall have
become known to such Lender independently of any disclosure by the Borrower
hereunder or in connection with the negotiation hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Lender may disclose the provisions of this Agreement and the
Delivery Agreement, the amounts, maturities and interest rates of its Loans, and
the Commitment Fee to which it is entitled, to any purchaser or potential
purchaser of such Lender's interest in any outstanding Loans.
