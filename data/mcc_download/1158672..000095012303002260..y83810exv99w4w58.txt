pay to the Purchaser the amount of the difference as an adjustment to the Share
Purchase Price (each of such amounts being the "Working Capital Adjustment").
The Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid in cash together with an additional
amount payable in cash compounded monthly from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the rate of 10% per annum.

                  the Vendor shall so advise the Purchaser by delivery to the
                  Purchaser of a written notice (the "Objection Notice") within
                  10 days after the delivery to the Vendor of the Closing
                  Statement. The Objection Notice shall set out the reasons for

                  Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration under this Section 3.5(c)
                  shall be in substitution for and precludes the bringing of any
                  action in any court in connection with any objection made by
                  the Vendor pursuant to this Section 3.5(c).

                  resolution, within 5 days after the final determination of the
                  arbitrator, the Vendor or the Purchaser, as the case may be,

                  Price is to be adjusted as a result of such resolution or
                  final determination in the manner contemplated by Section 3.4.

The Vendor represents and warrants to the Purchaser and acknowledges and agrees
that the Purchaser is relying on such representations and warranties in entering
into the Agreement, as follows:

4.1      INCORPORATION AND REGISTRATION

Each of the Companies is a corporation validly existing under the laws of Canada
and has all necessary corporate power, authority and capacity to own its
property and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Neither
the nature of its business nor the location or character of the property owned
or leased by each of the Companies requires it to be registered, licensed or
otherwise qualified as an extra-provincial or foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction and other than jurisdictions where the failure to be so registered,
licensed or otherwise qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on such
Company.

4.2      RESIDENCE OF THE VENDOR

The Vendor is not a non-resident of Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax
Act (Canada).

4.3      RIGHT TO SELL

The Vendor is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the
laws of Manitoba. The Vendor is the registered and beneficial owner of the
Purchased Shares free and clear of all Encumbrances other than the Permitted
Encumbrances. The Vendor has the exclusive right to dispose of the Purchased
Shares as provided in this Agreement and such disposition will not violate,
contravene, breach or offend against or result in any default under any
indenture, mortgage, lease, agreement, obligation, instrument, charter or by-law
provision, order, judgment, decree, licence, permit or Laws, to which the Vendor
is a party or subject or by which the Vendor is bound or affected other than (a)
any violations or defaults which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on any
of the Companies or affect the ability of the Purchaser to acquire the Purchased
Shares, and (b) under the Permitted Encumbrances which will be discharged prior
to Closing. The Purchased Shares are not subject to the terms of any
shareholders agreement, pooling agreement, voting trust or other agreement or
understanding with respect to the voting of the Purchased Shares.

<PAGE>

                                      -18-

4.4      CAPITALIZATION

The authorized and issued share capital of each of the Companies is as set forth
in Schedule 4.4. All of the Purchased Shares have been duly and validly issued
and are outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable shares. Except for the
Permitted Encumbrances, there are no outstanding agreements, warrants, options,
rights or privileges, pre-emptive or contractual, capable of becoming an
agreement, including convertible or exchangeable securities, to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire or otherwise obligating any of the Companies to
issue, any shares of the Companies or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares or other forms of ownership interests of the Companies.

4.5      TITLE TO THE ASSETS

Each of the Companies is the sole beneficial owner of all of its assets, real
and personal (other than the Intellectual Property and assets which are leased
or licensed), with good and valid title, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.
In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there has been
no assignment, subletting or granting of any licence (of occupation or
otherwise) of or in respect of any Company's assets or any granting of any
agreement or right capable of becoming an agreement or option for the purchase
of any of such assets other than (a) pursuant to the provisions of, or as
disclosed in this Agreement, or (b) by reason of certain Permitted Encumbrances
which will be discharged prior to Closing. With the exception of inventory in
transit, all the tangible assets used in the businesses of the Companies are
situate at the Owned Real Properties or the Leased Real Properties. As of the
Closing Time, the Companies will own or lease sufficient assets, property and
rights or have contractual entitlements through the Closing Agreements and the
Operational Services Agreements to enable them collectively to carry on the
Business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice, except for
those services noted on Schedule 4.36 as services which the Vendor is not
providing in such agreements and which the Purchaser is replacing.

4.6      DUE AUTHORIZATION

The Vendor has all necessary corporate power, authority and capacity to enter
into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Vendor.

                  be afforded an opportunity to resist, defend, settle and
                  compromise such Claim or Remediation Order and, in respect of
                  any Claim or Remediation Order made in connection with an
                  Environmental Condition, be afforded an opportunity to
                  implement any Remediation necessary to address such
                  Environmental Condition in a commercially reasonable manner
                  and in accordance with generally accepted engineering and
                  environmental practices, provided, however, that such
                  Remediation results in the full satisfaction of the Claim or
                  Remediation Order;

         (c)      the limitation that, for Losses in respect of Claims made in
                  connection with: (i) any representation or warranty; and (ii)

                  (f)(i) or (ii); (i) or (j)(ii), the Indemnifying Party shall:
                  (A) not be required to pay any such amount until the aggregate
                  of the Losses in respect of such Claims exceeds $500,000 and
                  upon the aggregate of the Losses in respect of such Claims
                  exceeding $500,000, the Indemnifying Party shall be required
                  to pay the amount owing in respect of all Losses in respect of
                  such Claims including the initial $500,000, provided, however,
                  that in the event of any Losses in respect of Claim made for a
                  breach of Section 4.11 (Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities),
                  the

                  Purchaser's Loss in respect of such breach for the purposes of
                  this Section 10.1 shall be deemed to be the entire amount of
                  the undisclosed liabilities; and (B) not be liable for an
                  amount exceeding the Aggregate Consideration;

         (d)      the limitation that for Losses in respect of any Claims or
                  Remediation Orders made in connection with an Environmental
                  Condition, the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) not be required
                  to pay any amount until and unless the aggregate of all Losses
                  in respect of such Claims or Remediation Orders exceeds
                  $500,000 (the "Environmental Deductible") and shall only be
                  required to pay for amounts which exceed the Environmental
                  Deductible; and (ii) not be liable for an amount exceeding the
                  Aggregate Consideration;

         (e)      the limitation that the Vendor shall not be liable for any
                  special, indirect, consequential, punitive or aggravated
                  damages, including damages for loss of profit;

         (f)      the limitation that no claim for indemnity hereunder may be
                  brought in respect of an Environmental Condition more than
                  four (4) years after the Closing Date;

10.2     INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AND GOVERNMENTAL
         ORDERS

         (a)      In the case of Claims made by a third party with respect to
                  which indemnification is sought or may be sought (including
                  Claims made by a Governmental Authority in respect of an
                  Environmental Condition), the Party seeking indemnification
                  (in this Section, the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt
                  Notice, and in any event within 20 days (or as soon as is
                  practical where the appeal period for an order of a
                  Governmental Authority is less than 20 days after the date the
                  Claim is received), to the other Party (in this Section, the
                  "Indemnifying Party") of any such Claims made upon it. If the
                  Indemnified Party fails to give such Notice, such failure
                  shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from obtaining such
                  indemnification, but its right to indemnification may be
                  reduced to the extent that such delay prejudiced the defence
                  of the Claim or increased the amount of liability or cost of
                  defence and provided that no Claim for indemnity in respect of
                  the breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
                  Agreement may be made unless Notice of such Claim has been
                  given prior to the expiry of the survival period applicable to
                  such representation and warranty pursuant to Section 6.2 and
                  no Claim for indemnity in respect of an Environmental
                  Condition may be made unless Notice of such Claim has been
                  given prior to the expiry of the four year limitation period
                  pursuant to Section 10.1(f).

         (b)      The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by Notice to the
                  Indemnified Party given not later than 30 days after receipt
                  of the Notice described in subsection (a), to assume the
                  control of the defence, compromise or settlement of the Claim.

         (c)      Upon the assumption of control of any Claim by the
                  Indemnifying Party as set out in subsection (b), the
                  Indemnifying Party shall diligently proceed with the defence,
                  compromise or settlement of the Claim and, if necessary, the
                  Indemnifying Party shall employ counsel and, in the case of an
                  Environmental

<PAGE>

                                      -48-

                  Condition, consultants and contractors reasonably satisfactory
                  to the Indemnified Party.

         (d)      If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the Claim, the
                  costs and expenses of the Indemnifying Party in connection
                  with any Claims other than Claims in connection with an
                  Environmental Condition shall be for the account of and paid
                  by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
                  control of any Claims made in connection with an Environmental
                  Condition or the proceedings with respect to a Remediation
                  Order, the costs and expenses of the Indemnifying Party
                  (including Remediation Costs) shall be paid by the
                  Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party shall
                  reimburse the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses
                  (including Remediation Costs) incurred by the Indemnifying
                  Party in defence, compromise or settlement of the Claim or
                  Remediation Order relating to the Environmental Condition up
                  to the amount of the Environmental Deductible.

         (e)      The final determination of any Claim pursuant to this Section,
                  including all related costs and expenses, shall be binding and
                  conclusive upon the Parties as to the validity or invalidity,
                  as the case may be of such Claim against the Indemnifying
                  Party.

         (f)      If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the Claim
                  as permitted in subsection (b), the Indemnified Party shall
                  not be entitled to any indemnity from the Indemnifying Party
                  in respect of such Claim if the Indemnified Party settles such
                  Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.

10.3     ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR REMEDIATION ORDERS AND
         REMEDIATION

In the event that:

         (a)      any Remediation Order is issued against CanWest, the Vendor or
                  any of their Affiliates or the Purchaser or any of the
                  Companies with respect to any Environmental Condition;

         (b)      the Purchaser, any of the Companies, CanWest or the Vendor or
                  any of their Affiliates is otherwise required by Environmental
                  Laws to Remediate any Environmental Condition; or

         (c)      the Parties agree that any Environmental Condition should be
                  Remediated in order to avoid the issuance of any potential
                  Claim or Remediation Order,

then:

         (d)      the Party that receives the Remediation Order or a notice of
                  Remediation Order shall give prompt Notice and in any event
                  within 20 days (or as soon as is practical if the appeal
                  period is 15 days or less) to the other Party of the existence
                  of same, together with such other information which is in the
                  possession or

<PAGE>

                  the context of the situation;

         (e)      each Party shall have the right to fully participate in any
                  discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect to
                  the Environmental Condition;

         (f)      the Vendor shall have the right, by notice to the Purchaser
                  given not later than 30 days after receipt of the Notice
                  described in subsection (d), to assume control of the
                  proceedings and actions taken with respect to the Remediation
                  Order and the Remediation, failing which the Purchaser shall
                  assume control of the proceedings and actions taken with
                  respect to the Remediation Order and the Remediation;

         (g)      each Party shall provide the other with all consultants' and
                  contractors' reports, monitoring or sampling reports or
                  results, correspondence and all other data, documents or
                  information which may be materially relevant to the
                  Remediation Order or the Remediation;

         (h)      each Party shall provide the other with all reasonable
                  co-operation and assistance which is reasonably requested by
                  the other, including providing access to employees for
                  interviews and questions and making such employees reasonably
                  available as witnesses;

         (i)      the Party undertaking any Remediation with respect to matters
                  covered by this Section shall:

                  (i)      always proceed in compliance with Environmental Laws
                           and in a commercially reasonable manner in accordance
                           with generally accepted engineering and environmental
                           practices;

                  (ii)     retain a properly qualified consultant to develop a
                           Remediation Plan to address the Environmental
                           Condition and, no later than 15 days prior to the
                           date upon which the Remediation Plan is finalised,
                           provide the other Party with a copy of such plan in
                           draft form;

                  (iii)    instruct such consultant to amend the draft
                           Remediation Plan to address any reasonable
                           suggestions or comments which are received from the
                           other Party;

                  (iv)     during the Remediation, provide the other Party, or
                           its representatives or consultants, with:

                           (A)      such information as may be reasonably
                                    requested by the other Party;

                           (B)      the opportunity to observe the work being
                                    undertaken and to take such samples and to
                                    undertake such tests as the other Party may
                                    reasonably request,

<PAGE>

                                      -50-

                           provided that the other Party shall do so at its own
                           expense and the Party undertaking the Remediation
                           will not accept any responsibility or liability for
                           any personal injury or any other damage that may be
                           caused to the other Party or its representatives or
                           consultants during such observations, howsoever
                           caused. If the other Party or its consultants or
                           representatives do attend to observe the work, then
                           they shall first execute a written waiver of
                           liability in favour of the Party undertaking the
                           Remediation in a form satisfactory to the Party
                           undertaking the Remediation, acting reasonably; and

                  (v)      provide the other Party, as soon as is practicable
                           and in any event no later than 30 days after the
                           Remediation is completed, with a Completion Report
                           from the consultant;

         (j)      the Remediation Costs shall be paid as provided in Section
                  10.2(d); and

         (k)      in the event that the Party undertaking the Remediation is the
                  Vendor, the Purchaser shall provide the Vendor with such
                  access to the Real Property as may be required by the Vendor
                  to properly undertake such Remediation, provided that the
                  Vendor shall take all reasonable steps to avoid any
                  unreasonable interference with the business operations at the
                  Real Property.

10.4     GOOD FAITH

The Parties shall at all times act:

         (a)      in good faith in matters relating to Sections 10.3 or 10.4 of
                  this Agreement;

         (b)      to reduce the likelihood of a Remediation Order being issued;

         (c)      to reduce or minimize the likelihood of a Claim being made,
                  the amount of any such Claim and the costs or expenses payable
                  under this Agreement where Remediation is to be undertaken;
                  and

         (d)      always in a manner consistent with reasonableness and sound
                  business and environmental practices.

10.5     DISPUTES

In the event that any dispute or disagreement shall arise between the Parties
regarding any matter pursuant to Sections 10.3 or 10.4 (including the content of

1.       DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

         (a)      DEFINITIONS - Unless otherwise defined in this Schedule, all

                  this Schedule have the same meaning as provided for those

                  "Dispute" means any matter which a Party, in accordance with
                  the terms of the Agreement, submits to arbitration in

                  relating to available remedies, set-off claims, conflict of
                  laws rules and claims to costs and interest) shall be governed
                  by the laws of the Province of Ontario. Except as expressly
                  provided otherwise in this Schedule or the Agreement, the
                  provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1991 S.O. 1991 c.17
                  (Ontario) (the "Arbitration Act") shall apply in respect of
                  any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Schedule.

         (c)      TIME - In the computation of time under the Procedures or an
                  order or direction given by the Arbitrator pursuant to this
                  Schedule, except where a contrary intention appears or the
                  Parties otherwise agree:

                  (i)      where there is a reference to a number of days
                           between two events, those days shall be counted by
                           excluding the day on which the first event happens
                           and including the day on which the second event
                           happens, even if they are described as clear days or

<PAGE>

                                       -2-

                  (ii)     where the time for doing any act under this Schedule
                           or any order or direction given by the Arbitrator
                           expires on a day which is not a Business Day, the act
                           may be done on the next day that is not a Business
                           Day; and

                  (iii)    delivery of a document or notice provided for in this
                           Schedule or any order or direction given by the
                           Arbitrator made after 4:00 p.m. (Toronto time) or at
                           any time on a day which is not a Business Day, shall
                           be deemed to have been made on the next Business Day.

2.       COMMENCEMENT OF ARBITRATION - Any Party to the Agreement (the
         "Applicant") may commence arbitration for a Dispute by delivering a
         written notice (a "Complaint") to the Party against whom the Applicant
         seeks a remedy (the "Respondent"). In the Complaint, the Applicant
         shall describe the substance of the Dispute and name three (3) persons
         whom the Applicant is prepared to appoint as arbitrator, each of such
         persons to be an Approved Arbitrator. Within 10 days of the receipt of
         the Complaint, the Respondent shall by written Notice to the Applicant
         appoint one of the three (3) persons named by the Applicant or provide
         the Applicant with a list of three (3) persons who are Approved
         Arbitrators. Within 10 days of receipt of the Respondent's list, by
         written Notice to the Respondent, the Applicant shall appoint one (1)
         of such persons, or provide a further list of (3) three Approved
         Arbitrators. The Parties shall continue to exchange lists of three (3)
         Approved Arbitrators in this fashion until an Approved Arbitrator is
         appointed. If an Arbitrator is not appointed within 30 days of the
         initial receipt by the Respondent of the Complaint, either Party may
         apply to a judge of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to appoint
         the Arbitrator on behalf of the Parties.

3.       ARBITRATION PROCEDURES - The following procedures shall apply to the
         arbitration of any Dispute, except as the Parties may otherwise agree
         or as the Arbitrator otherwise directs:

         (a)      Within 10 days of the appointment of the Arbitrator, the
                  Applicant shall deliver to the Respondent and the Arbitrator a
                  written statement (the "Claim") concerning the Dispute setting
                  forth, with particularity, the full names, descriptions and
                  addresses of the Parties, the nature of the Claim, the
                  allegations of fact supporting the Dispute submitted for
                  arbitration and the relief or remedy sought.

         (b)      Within 20 days after the delivery of the Claim, the Respondent
                  shall deliver to the Applicant and the Arbitrator a written
                  response (the "Answer") to the Claim setting forth, with
                  particularity, its position on the Dispute and the allegations
                  of fact supporting the Answer.

         (c)      If any Respondent fails to deliver an Answer within the time
                  limit referred to in subsection 3(b) of this Schedule, that
                  Respondent shall, subject to subsection 3(f), be deemed to
                  have admitted the allegations of fact alleged in the Claim and
                  have accepted the Applicant's entitlement to the relief and
                  remedy set out in the Claim.

         (d)      Within 7 days after the delivery of any Answer, the Applicant
                  may deliver to the Respondent and the Arbitrator a written
                  reply (the "Reply") to that Answer, setting forth, with
                  particularity, its response, if any, to the Answer.

                                       -3-

         (e)      If the Respondent wants to submit any other Dispute to the
                  Arbitrator it may, within the time provided for the delivery
                  of the Answer to the Claim, also deliver to the Applicant and
                  the Arbitrator a counter-complaint (the "Counter-Complaint")
                  setting forth, with particularity, the nature of the
                  Counter-Complaint, the allegations of fact supporting the
                  Counter-Complaint and the relief or remedy sought, for the
                  Arbitrator to decide. Within 15 days of the delivery of a
                  Counter-Complaint, the Applicant shall deliver to the
                  Respondent making a Counter-Complaint and the Arbitrator an
                  Answer to such Counter-Complaint setting forth, with
                  particularity, its position on the Counter-Complaint and the
                  allegations of fact supporting the Counter-Complaint. If the
                  Applicant fails to deliver an Answer to the Counter-Complaint
                  within such 15-day period, the Applicant will be deemed,
                  subject to subsection (f) to have admitted the allegations of
                  fact alleged in the Counter-Complaint, and have accepted the
                  Respondent's entitlement to the relief and remedy set out in
                  the Counter-Complaint. Within 7 days after the delivery of an
                  Answer to the Counter-Complaint, the Respondent may deliver to
                  the Applicant and the Arbitrator a Reply to such Answer
                  setting forth, with particularity, its response to such
                  Answer. Any Dispute submitted to arbitration in accordance
                  with this subsection 3(e) shall be governed by, and dealt with
                  as if it were the subject of a Complaint, that shall be
                  determined by the same Arbitrator as part of the same
                  arbitration proceeding as the Complaint.

         (f)      The time limits set for the delivery of the documents referred
                  to in subsections 3(a) to (e) inclusive may be extended by
                  agreement of the Parties to the Agreement or by the Arbitrator
                  for such period, on such terms, and for such reasons as he or
                  she in his or her discretion may determine upon application
                  made to the Arbitrator in writing by either the Applicant or
                  the Respondent on notice to the other, either before the
                  expiry of the time limit in issue or within 2 days thereafter,
                  and the Arbitrator may relieve the applying Party of the
                  consequences of its failure to comply with the time limit in
                  issue, provided, however, that the other Party shall be given
                  an opportunity to make submissions on the application.

         (g)      Within 7 days following the completion of the steps set out in
                  subsections 3(a) to (e) of this Schedule, a Party may, upon
                  written notice to the other Party and to the Arbitrator,
                  request the Arbitrator to give directions and make any order
                  which is, in the discretion of the Arbitrator, reasonable
                  regarding any procedural matters which properly should be
                  resolved before the arbitration proceeds further, including:
                  the amendment of any Claim, Counter-Complaint, Answer or
                  Reply; the provision of particulars; the production of
                  documents and the need for examinations for discoveries in
                  connection with the arbitration, either by way of oral
                  examination or written interrogatories and a determination as
                  to the manner in which evidence shall be presented to the
                  Arbitrator (by way of agreed statement of facts, affidavit
                  evidence and transcripts of cross-examinations on such
                  affidavit evidence or viva voce, or some combination thereof).
                  In making any order or giving any direction in respect of any
                  procedural matter the Arbitrator may impose such terms as are
                  reasonable in order to ensure the completion of the
                  arbitration in a timely manner. The notice requesting any
                  direction or order pursuant to this subsection shall state the
                  direction or order

<PAGE>

                                       -4-

                  sought and set out the reasons for seeking such direction or
                  order. Nothing in this subsection shall be taken to limit the
                  jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to deal with procedural matters
                  in accordance with the Arbitration Act.

         (h)      Within 14 days of the delivery of the last of the statements
                  described in Section 3 (each a "Statement") to the Arbitrator,
                  or the expiry of the time for delivery of the last of such
                  Statements, each Party may, at its option, make a reply to any
                  Statement (a "Reply Statement").

         (i)      In the case where no Party has requested directions in
                  accordance with paragraph 3(g), the Parties shall have an
                  opportunity to make oral submissions to the Arbitrator
                  following the delivery of the Statements provided for in
                  paragraph 3(h). Such oral submissions shall be made at a
                  hearing ("Hearing") to be scheduled for a date within 30 days
                  of the delivery of the Reply Statements provided for in
                  subparagraph 3(h).

         (j)      Unless the time for making an award is extended by agreement
                  of the Parties or by court order, the Arbitrator shall make an
                  award within 60 days after completion of any Hearing. The
                  award shall be in writing and shall state the reasons on which
                  it is based. Executed copies of all awards shall be delivered
                  by the Arbitrator to each Party as soon as is reasonably
                  possible.

4.       AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND - Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of
         this Schedule, no individual shall be appointed as Arbitrator unless he
         or she agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this
         Schedule.

5.       ARBITRATOR DISCRETION - Subject to the Arbitration Act, the Agreement
         and this Schedule, the Arbitrator may conduct the arbitration in such
         manner as the Arbitrator considers appropriate.

6.       INTERIM RELIEF - At the request of any Party, the Arbitrator may take
         such interim measures as the Arbitrator considers necessary in respect
         of the Dispute, including measures for the preservation of assets, the
         conservation of goods or the sale of perishable goods. The Arbitrator
         may require security for the costs of such measures.

7.       REMEDIES - The Arbitrator may make final, interim, interlocutory and
         partial awards. An award may grant any remedy or relief which the
         Arbitrator considers just and equitable and consistent with the
         intention of the Parties under the Agreement. The Arbitrator shall
         state in the award whether or not the Arbitrator views the award as
         final or interim, for purposes of any judicial proceedings in
         connection with such award.

8.       DECISION OF ARBITRATOR OR PANEL FINAL AND BINDING - Any award rendered
         or determination made by the Arbitrator or by the Panel, as applicable,
         including any determination relating to interim or interlocutory
         matters, shall be final and binding and there shall be no appeal
         therefrom, subject only to the provisions for putting aside an award
         contained in Section 46 of the Arbitration Act. Except as specifically
         provided herein, all issues arising in connection with the Dispute and
         the resolution thereof, including issues relating to interlocutory and
         interim matters, shall be resolved by the

<PAGE>

         Arbitrator or by the Panel pursuant to the procedures set forth herein
         and shall not be resolved by application to the Ontario Superior Court
         of Justice or any other court.

9.       COSTS OF ARBITRATION - The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and
         costs of the arbitration facilities shall be billed to and paid in
         equal proportions by the Parties to the Arbitration. The Arbitrator
         shall have the power to award costs, including the fees and expenses of
         the Arbitrator and costs of the arbitration facilities, in whole or in
         part where it is fair and reasonable, upon hearing submissions by any
         Party to the Arbitration requesting same, and any responding
         submissions from the other Party to the Arbitration. Unless otherwise
         specifically ordered by the Arbitrator, any costs awarded shall be on a
         party and party scale and not on a solicitor and client scale, or
         substantial indemnity scale.

10.      NOTICES - All Notices and all other documents required or permitted by
         this Schedule to be given by any Party to the arbitration to any other

         Agreement. All Notices and all other documents required or permitted by
         this Schedule to be given by any Party to the arbitration to the
         Arbitrator shall be given in accordance with the Arbitrator's
         instructions.

         Schedule.

12.      CONFIDENTIALITY - The Parties shall keep confidential and not disclose
         to any Person the existence of the Arbitration and any element of the
         Arbitration (including submissions and any evidence or documents
         presented or exchanged and any awards thereunder), except to the
         Arbitrator, the Parties' shareholders, auditors and insurers, legal
         counsel to the Parties and any other Person necessary to the conduct of
         the Arbitration and except to the extent required by law, the rules of
         a stock exchange or securities regulatory authority having jurisdiction
         over a Party or required to enforce any award or decision made pursuant
         thereto. No individual shall be appointed as an Arbitrator unless he or
         she agrees in writing to be bound by a confidentiality provision
         similar in form and substance to this Section 12.

13.      EXPERTS - The Arbitrator shall not, without the written consent of all
         the parties to the arbitration, appoint any expert or other consultant
         or retain any counsel to advise him or her.
