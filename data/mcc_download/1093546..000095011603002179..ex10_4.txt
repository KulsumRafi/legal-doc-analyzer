all of them, notwithstanding any accelerated exercise period contained in any
such Option.

             (d) Termination by Executive For Good Reason or Termination by
Employer Without Cause Prior to a Change of Control. If prior to a Change of
Control this Agreement is terminated by Executive for Good Reason, or if this
Agreement is terminated by Employer other than For Cause then (i) Employer shall

the greater of Executive's most recent annual bonus or his Target Incentive
bonus), for the remaining term under this Employment Agreement; and (ii) the
Options plus all other stock, options or other equity rights in Employer which
Executive received in connection with his employment by Employer shall become
immediately 100% vested and Executive shall have the full term of such Options
in which to exercise any or all of them, notwithstanding any accelerated
exercise period contained in any such Option.

             (e) Termination by Executive For Good Reason or Termination by
Employer Without Cause Following a Change of Control. If following a Change of
Control this Agreement is terminated by Executive for Good Reason or by Employer
other than For Cause, then Employer shall within ten (10) days after the date of
termination pay to Executive in cash: (i) an amount equal to 2.99 times
Executive's Basic Compensation calculated at the rate in effect on the date of
termination; (ii) current and carried-over unused vacation days; and (iii) all
other amounts to which Executive is entitled, including (A) any bonus to which
Executive would have been entitled had he remained employed by Employer for a
period of three (3) years following the date of termination (calculated on an
annual basis as the greater of Executive's most recent annual bonus or the
Target Incentive bonus), (B) any expense reimbursement amounts accrued to the
effective date of termination, and (C) any amounts under any other benefit plan
of the Employer, in each case at the time such payments are due. Also, for three
years following the date of termination, the Employer shall continue to provide
Executive with all fringe benefits or the economic equivalent thereof he was
receiving as of the date of termination, including, without limitation, all
health, life and disability insurance he was receiving immediately prior to the
date of termination, or the economic equivalent thereof, as if he were actually
employed for that period. Moreover, any Options held by Executive which were
not fully exercisable on the date of Executive's termination pursuant to this
Section 6 shall vest and immediately become fully exercisable by Executive upon
the date of termination, and Executive shall have the following term of such
Options in which to exercise any or all of them, notwithstanding any accelerated
exercise period contained in any such Option.

         Executive shall have the right to elect with respect to the payment to
him of 2.99 times his annual Compensation pursuant to Section 6.2(e) above to
take such payment in the form of either (x) a single sum payment in cash or (y)
securities of the Employer equal in value to the amount of such payment, with
such securities valued for purposes hereof at 75% of the average closing price



                                       9
<PAGE>

were listed. The Employer further agrees to include the shares acquired
hereunder by Executive, at its sole cost and expense, in a Registration
Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission providing for
the resale of such shares in an open market or private transaction, within sixty
(60) days after the date of the distribution of such shares.

         7.  TAX INDEMNITY PAYMENTS

             (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Employer or
any affiliates to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or
distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of the Agreement or otherwise
but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this
Section 7 (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Code or any successor provision (collectively, "Section 4999"), or
any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise
tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then Executive shall
be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount
such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or
penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation,
any Federal, state or local income and employment taxes and Excise Tax (and any
interest and penalties imposed with respect to any such taxes) imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to
the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

             (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7(b), all determinations
required to be made under this Section 7, including whether and when a Gross-Up
Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumption
to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Employer's
public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to Employer and Executive within fifteen (15)
business days of the receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a
Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by Employer. In the event that the
Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity
or group affecting the Change of Control, Executive may appoint another
nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required
hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting
Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne
solely by the Employer. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this
Section 7, shall be paid by Employer to Executive within five (5) days of the
receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm
determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it shall furnish
Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on
Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the
imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Employer and Executive.

             (c) Executive shall notify Employer in writing of any claim by the
Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require a payment by
Employer, or a change in the amount of the payment by Employer, of the Gross-Up
Payment and Employer shall be responsible to make such payment to Employer. Such



                                       10
<PAGE>


notification shall be given as soon as practicable after Executive is informed
in writing of such claim and shall apprise Employer of the nature of such claim
and the date on which such claim is required to be paid; provided that the
failure to give any notice pursuant to this Section 7(c) shall not impair
Executive's rights under this Section 7 except to the extent Employer is
materially prejudiced thereby. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the
expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which Employee gives such
notice to Employer (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment
of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If Employer notifies Executive in
writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such
claim, Executive shall:

                  (1) give Employer any information reasonably requested by
             Employer;

                  (2) take such action in connection with contesting such claim
             as Employer shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
             including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with
             respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by
             Employer;

                  (3) cooperate with Employer in good faith in order to
             effectively contest such claim; and

                  (4) permit Employer to participate in any proceedings relating
             to such claim;

provided, however, that Employer shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an
after-tax-basis, for any Excise Tax or income, employment or other tax
(including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of
such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7(c), Employer shall control all
proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may
pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with the taxing authority in respect to such claim and may, at its
sole option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund
or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and Executive agrees to
prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in
a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as Employer
shall determine; provided further, that if Employer directs Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund, Employer shall advance the amount of such
payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income,
employment or other tax (including interest or penalties with respect to any
such taxes) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed
income with respect to such advance; and provided further, that any extension of
the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of
Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is
limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, Employer's control of the
contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment
would be payable hereunder and Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest,
as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or
any other taxing authority.



                                       11

             (d) If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by
Employer pursuant to Section 7(c), Executive becomes entitled to receive, and
receives, any refund with respect to such claim, Executive shall (subject to
Employer's complying with the requirements of Section 7(c)) promptly pay to
Employer the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited
thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by Executive of
an amount advanced by Employer pursuant to Section 7(c), a determination is made
that Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim
and Employer does not notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such
denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such
determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to
be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof,
the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

     8. CHARACTER OF TERMINATION PAYMENTS; MITIGATION

         The amounts payable to Executive upon any termination of this Agreement
shall be considered severance pay in consideration of past services rendered on
behalf of the Employer and his continued service from the date hereof to the
date he becomes entitled to such payments. Executive shall have no duty to
mitigate his damages by seeking other employment and, should Executive actually
receive compensation from any such other employment, the payments required
hereunder shall not be reduced or offset by any such other compensation.

     9. CONFIDENTIALITY AND RELATED MATTERS.

        9.1 NON-DISCLOSURE COVENANT

             Employer and the Executive acknowledge that the services to be
performed by the Executive under this Agreement are unique and valuable and
that, as a result of the Executive's employment, the Executive will be in a
relationship of confidence and trust with Employer and will come into possession
of "Confidential Information" (i) owned or controlled by Employer and its
subsidiaries and affiliates; (ii) in the possession of Employer and its
subsidiaries and affiliates and belonging to third parties; or (iii) conceived,
originated, discovered or developed, in whole or in part, by the Executive
during the term of this Agreement and relating to his duties for the Employer
under this Agreement. As used herein "Confidential Information" means trade
secrets and other confidential or proprietary business, technical, personnel or
financial information of Employer, whether or not the Executive's work product,
in written, graphic, oral or other tangible or intangible forms, including but
not limited to specifications, samples, records, data, computer programs,
drawings, diagrams, models, consumer names, ID's or e-mail addresses, business
or marketing plans, studies, analyses, projections and reports, communications
by or to attorneys (including attorney-client privileged communications), memos
and other materials prepared by attorneys or under their direction (including


                                       12
<PAGE>

attorney work product), and software systems and processes that are not readily
available to the public, even it is not specifically marked as a trade secret or
confidential, unless Employer advises the Executive otherwise in writing or
unless the information has been shared by Employer with entities not bound by
non-disclosure agreements. In consideration of the compensation and benefits to
be paid or provided to the Executive by the Employer under this Agreement, the
Executive agrees not to directly or indirectly use or disclose to anyone, either
during the Employment Period or after the termination of this Agreement, except
in the performance of his duties of his employment with Employer or with
Employer's prior written consent, any Confidential Information of Employer. This
non-disclosure covenant does not apply to information that is disclosed or
becomes public through another source that is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with Employer; which Executive is required to disclose pursuant to
court order, subpoena or applicable law (provided that Executive will use
reasonable efforts to provide Employer with prompt notice of any such requests
or requirement so that Employer may seek an appropriate protective order); or
which is disclosed in any proceeding to enforce or interpret this Agreement. The
Executive agrees that in the event of the termination of the Executive's
employment for any reason, the Executive will deliver to Employer, upon request,
all property belonging to Employer, including all documents and materials of any
nature pertaining to the Executive's work with Employer and will not take with
him any documents or materials of any description, or any reproduction thereof
of any description, containing or pertaining to any Confidential Information.

         9.2 WORK MADE FOR HIRE

         Executive recognizes and understands that Executive's duties at the
Employer may include the preparation of materials, including without limitation
written or graphic materials, and that any such materials conceived or written
by Executive shall be done as "work made for hire" as defined and used in the
Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. ss.ss. 1 et seq. In the event of publication of
such materials, Executive understands that since the work is a "work made for
hire", the Employer will solely retain and own all rights in said materials,
including right of copyright.

         9.3 DISCLOSURE OF WORKS AND INVENTIONS/ASSIGNMENT OF PATENTS

         In consideration of the promises set forth herein, Executive agrees to
disclose promptly to the Employer, or to such person whom the Employer may
expressly designate for this specific purpose (its "Designee"), any and all
works, inventions, discoveries and improvements authored, conceived or made by
Executive during the period of employment and related to the business or
activities of the Employer, and Executive hereby assigns and agrees to assign
all of Executive's interest in the foregoing to the Employer or to its Designee.
Executive agrees that, whenever he is requested to do so by the Employer,
Executive shall execute any and all applications, assignments or other
instruments which the Company shall deem necessary to apply for and obtain
Letters Patent or Copyrights of the United States or any foreign country or to
otherwise protect the Company's interest therein. Such obligations shall
continue beyond the termination or nonrenewal of Executive's employment with



                                       13
<PAGE>


respect to any works, inventions, discoveries and/or improvements that are
authored, conceived of, or made by Executive during the period of Executive's
employment, and shall be binding upon Executive's successors, assigns,
executors, heirs, administrators or other legal representatives.

     10. NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION MATTERS

         10.1 NON-COMPETITION

         During the term of this Agreement the Executive agrees that he shall
not work for or be interested in any business which provides services or
products which are directly competitive with "primary" services or products
offered by the Employer or a subsidiary or affiliate of Employer at any time
during his term of employment or at the Executive's termination date (the
"Non-Compete Period"). In the event the Executive is terminated For Cause or
Executive terminates for other than Good Reason, the Non-Compete Period shall be
extended until the earlier of (i) one year; or (ii) the then scheduled
expiration of the term of the Agreement. In the event the Executive is
terminated in a manner in which he is paid severance, his Basic Compensation is
continued, or he is paid a lump-sum as though his employment had continued, the
Non-Compete Period shall be extended through the period of such severance or
compensation continuation. For the purpose of this Agreement, a product or
service shall be deemed "primary" only if such service or product constitutes a
primary component of the core business of Employer on Executive's termination
date. For the further purposes of this Agreement, the term "work for or be
interested in any business" means that the Executive is a stockholder, director,
officer, employee, partner, individual proprietor, lender or consultant with
that business, but not if (i) his interest is limited solely to the passive
ownership of five percent (5%) or less of any class of the equity or debt
securities of a corporation whose shares are listed for trading on a national
securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market. In the event that
any part of this Section 9 is adjudged invalid or unenforceable by any court of
record, board of arbitration or judicial or quasi judicial entity having
jurisdiction thereof by reason of length of time, geographical coverage,
activities covered, or for any other reason, then the invalid or unenforceable
provisions of this covenant shall be deemed reformed and amended to the maximum
extent permissible under applicable law and shall be enforced and enforceable as
so amended in accordance with the intention of the parties as expressed herein.

         10.2 NON-SOLICITATION

         During the Non-Compete Period, the Executive also agrees that he will
not directly or indirectly: (i) solicit the trade of, or trade with, any past,
present or prospective customer of the Employer for any business purpose that
directly or indirectly competes with the business of Employer or a subsidiary or
affiliate of Employer; or (ii) solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or
induce, any employee of Employer to leave Employer for any reason whatsoever, or
assist or participate in the hiring of any employee of Employer to work for
another entity.

     11. REPRESENTATIONS OF EXECUTIVE

         As a material inducement to Employer to execute this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, the Executive hereby makes the
following representations to Employer, each of which are true and correct in all
material respects as of the date hereof.

         11.1 QUESTIONNAIRE

              On or before the date hereof Executive has completed and returned
to Employer a Directors and Officers Questionnaire (the "Questionnaire") which
is true and correct in all material respects.

         11.2 NO PRIOR AGREEMENTS

              Executive represents and warrants that Executive is not a party to
or otherwise subject to or bound by the terms of any contract, agreement or
understanding which in any manner would limit or otherwise affect Executive's
ability to perform his obligations hereunder, including without limitation any
contract, agreement or understanding containing terms and provisions similar in
any manner to those contained in Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement. Executive
further represents and warrants that his employment with the Employer will not
under any circumstances require him to disclose or use any confidential
information belonging to prior Employers or other persons or entities, or to
engage in any conduct which may potentially interfere with the contractual,
statutory or common-law rights of such other Employers, persons or entities. In
the event that Executive knows or learns of any facts whatsoever which suggest
that such interference might arguably occur as the result of any proposed
actions by either Executive or the Employer, Executive expressly promises that
he will immediately bring such facts to the Employer's attention.

         11.3 REVIEW BY COUNSEL

              Executive expressly acknowledges and represents that Executive has
been given a full and fair opportunity to review this Agreement with an attorney
of Executive's choice, and that Executive has satisfied himself, with or without
consulting with counsel, that the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenant and related
provisions of Section 9 hereof, are reasonable and enforceable.

         11.4 NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

              Executive covenants that, as of the date hereof, he is not
involved in any venture or activity that could compete with Employer or which
could potentially interfere with his ability to perform under this Agreement.
During the Term, he will disclose to the Company, in writing, any and all
interests he may have, whether for profit or compensation or not, in any venture
or activity which could potentially interfere with his ability to perform under
this Agreement or create a conflict of interest for him with the Company. For
purposes of this Section 10.4 only, "conflict of interest" shall mean ownership
of greater than one percent (1%) of, or $25,000 worth of equity in, another
company which conducts business similar to that undertaken by the Employer.



                                       15
<PAGE>

         11.5 EXECUTIVE'S ABILITY

              Executive represents that Executive's experience and capabilities,
and the limited provisions of Section 9, are such that he will not be prevented
from earning his livelihood in businesses similar to that of Employer. Executive
acknowledges that there are a significant number of businesses for which his
qualifications and experience would render him qualified for employment that do
not constitute a competing businesses such that his ability to become employed
after the termination or nonrenewal of this Agreement would not be impaired.


     12. GENERAL PROVISIONS

         12.1 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ADDITIONAL REMEDY

              The Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered
by the Employer as a result of a breach of the provisions of any provision of
Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement would be irreparable and that an award of
monetary damages to the Employer for such a breach would be an inadequate
remedy. Consequently Employer will have the right, in addition to any other
rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provisions of
Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement, and the Employer will not be obligated to
post bond or other security in seeking such relief.

         12.2 WAIVER

              The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by either
party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other
right, power, or privilege.

         12.3 TOLLING PERIOD

              The non-competition, non-disclosure and non-solicitation
obligations contained in Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement shall be extended by
the length of time during which Executive shall have been in breach of any of
the provisions of such Sections 8 and 9, regardless of whether the Employer knew
or should have known of such breach.



                                       16
<PAGE>

         12.4 EMPLOYER VIOLATION NOT A DEFENSE

              In an action by the Employer to enforce any provision of this
Agreement, any claims asserted by Executive against the Employer shall not
constitute a defense to the Employer's action.

         12.5 INDEMNIFICATION

              Employer shall indemnify and defend Executive and his heirs,
executors and administrators against any costs or expense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement, if such settlement is approved
by the Employer), fine, penalty, judgment and liability reasonable incurred by
or imposed upon Executive in connection with any action, suit or proceeding,
civil or criminal, to which Executive may be made a party or with which
Executive shall be threatened, by reason of Executive's being or having been an
officer or director, unless with respect to such matter Executive shall have
been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith or in the
reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Employer, or
unless such indemnification is precluded by law, public policy, or in the
judgment of the Employer's Board of Directors, such indemnification is being
sought as a result of actions of Executive which were either: (i) grossly
negligent; (ii) reflective of Executive misconduct; (iii) in violation of rules,
regulations or laws applicable to the Employer; or (iv) in disregard of Employer
policies.

         12.6 NOTICES

              All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under
this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given
when (a) delivered by hand, (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of
receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt

faith to settle such dispute or controversy by mediation under the applicable
rules of the American Arbitration Association before resorting to arbitration.
In the event such dispute or controversy remains unresolved in whole or in part

arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.
Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having
jurisdiction. All administration fees and arbitration fees shall be paid solely

to compensation and benefits, which may be transferred only by will or operation
of law.

         12.11 SURVIVAL
