as the Compensation Committee determines are appropriate and advisable to meet the conditions of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code as currently in effect, as such performance
conditions shall be reflected in the minutes of the meeting of the properly constituted Compensation Committee under Section&nbsp;162(m) considering such performance conditions. The performance

other
similarly situated executive officers of the Company proximate to the Effective Date (e.g. in December&nbsp;2002 and/or January or February&nbsp;2003). Any recommendation the Company may make to

being mutually acceptable to the Company and Executive. The Restricted Stock shall vest and no longer be subject to any restriction on the third anniversary of the Effective Date, subject to the
satisfaction of the performance conditions and Executive's continued employment through such date; provided, however, that in the event (i)&nbsp;the Executive is terminated by the Company without

in any given year, all of the above-referenced Restricted Stock shall immediately vest as of the date of Executive's termination as provided in paragraph&nbsp;1(d) of the Terms and Conditions. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event Executive (i)&nbsp;resigns from his position for Good Reason on any day of the calendar year other than the last day of the Company's taxable year in any given
year or (ii)&nbsp;is terminated by the Company without Cause, the Restricted Stock shall vest as provided in paragraph&nbsp;1(d) of the Terms and Conditions without regard to whether the
performance conditions have or have not been met. This Agreement shall prevail in the event of any ambiguity or conflict between the Restricted Stock Agreement and the terms of the grant of Restricted
Stock set forth herein. </FONT></P>
