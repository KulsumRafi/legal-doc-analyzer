<P ALIGN="CENTER">Collaboration Agreement<BR>
</B>between<BR>
<B><U>Applied Biosystems and Cepheid</P>
</B></U>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>THIS AGREEMENT (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is made as of the 11th day of October, 2002 (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;) and is by and between Applera Corporation, a Delaware corporation, acting through its Applied Biosystems Group, with a place of business at 850 Lincoln Center Drive, Foster City, CA 94404, U.S.A. (&quot;ABI&quot;), and Cepheid, a California corporation with its principal place of business at 904 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94089  (&quot;Cepheid&quot;).  Cepheid and ABI are sometimes referred to herein individually as a &quot;Party,&quot; and collectively as the &quot;Parties&quot;.</P>

<B><P>1.</B>  <B>Background</P>
</B>
<P>1.1  <U>Supply to the USPS</U>.  ABI and Cepheid will each independently and working collaboratively seek to develop and manufacture Products for use in Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems.  These Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems are intended to be provided to the USPS through agreements among the USPS, Northrop Grumman Security Services (&quot;Northrop Grumman&quot;), ETG (Environmental Technology Group, now known as Smiths-Detection Edgewood, Inc.), and/ or Cepheid, and potentially others.  These Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems are intended to be used in conjunction with the mail sorting machines used by the USPS, in order for the USPS to test for particular bio-threat agents identified as being of interest to the USPS.</P>

<P>1.2  <U>ABI Materials</U>.  The systems that are being provided are based on an assay called the 5' nuclease detection process, a process employing in part the polymerase chain reaction (&quot;PCR&quot;), herein called Real-Time PCR.  Due to licensing constraints imposed by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. and F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd (&quot;collectively, Roche&quot;), the owner of some of the patents for the Real-Time PCR process, certain rules must be followed in order for Cepheid and the USPS to be properly licensed under the Real-Time PCR patents as contemplated by this Agreement.  [***]ABI owns other rights related to the Real-Time PCR process [***].</P>

<P>1.3  <U>Intellectual Property Objectives</U>.  It is the Parties' intention that through this Agreement and the parties' existing Thermal Cycler Supplier Agreement obtained from ABI, under which Cepheid is authorized by ABI under certain of the PCR Rights to manufacture and sell thermal cyclers, and under which Cepheid manufactures and sells its GeneXpert&reg; thermal cycler instrument, the Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems to be sold to the USPS will be fully licensed or otherwise manufactured and sold with all necessary authority under all PCR related intellectual property rights of ABI as well as Roche.</P>

<P>1.4  <U>Prior Work by Cepheid</U>.  Cepheid has been working in collaboration with the USPS and Northrop Grumman to develop an initial assay to be used in conjunction with the GeneXpert Module in order to test for certain strains of <I>Bacillus anthracis</I> (&quot;anthrax&quot;) of interest to the USPS.  Those parties have undertaken significant initial validation studies in order to satisfy the requirements of the USPS and, as part of those development activities, certain Third Party Materials have been and are being used.  Cepheid and ABI now wish to develop and employ Products in which ABI PCR Materials will be used instead of such Third Party Materials so that certain anticipated advantages of ABI PCR Materials may be realized, but recognize that the already validated initial assay will be used during the initial period of implementation by the USPS.  The parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to demonstrate to the USPS that Products using ABI PCR Materials will meet or exceed all USPS requirements and specifications and that such Products should be accepted instead of those using the initial materials.  It should be noted, however, that the ultimate decision as to whether to switch to ABI PCR Materials may be within the discretion of the USPS.  The Parties have begun to explore the use of ABI PCR Materials and have determined to engage in the Joint Development Program to develop, qualify and validate them for use as the reagent components of Products, so that a new, validated assay using ABI materials and employing their anticipated advantages may be substituted for the initial assay as soon as feasible, preferably within six months of the Effective Date.</P>

<P>1.5   <U>Special Format Assay</U>.  An important feature of this program for the USPS is the special format of the reagent kit for performing the assay.  Cepheid has developed a method of drying the liquid reagents into a pelletized form.  The dried pellets can be placed into a proprietary self-contained cartridge developed by Cepheid, in which the reagents can be reconstituted at the time that the assay is to be performed.  The cartridge itself has significant added value, in that it is the vessel in which the anthrax spores are cracked and in which Real-Time PCR is performed.</P>

<P>1.6  <U>Purpose</U>.  The Parties wish to enter into this Agreement to set forth the terms and conditions under which development of the initial validated system described above will be completed, development of second generation Products will be undertaken, and designated systems will be manufactured and supplied to the USPS by ABI, either directly or through Cepheid as a distributor of ABI, or Northrop Grumman or another Third Party or Third Parties distributors or subdistributors.</P>
<P>Now therefor, the Parties, in consideration of the mutual obligations hereinafter set forth and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:</P>

<P>4.3.4. <U>Joint Steering Committee Decisions and Dispute Resolution</U>.  A quorum for the conduct of business at meeting of the Joint Steering Committee shall consist of at least two members from each Party.  Decisions by the Joint Steering Committee will be made by consensus - that is, all members in attendance at a meeting at which there is a quorum must agree.  If the Joint Steering Committee is unable to reach agreement on a matter, within 10 business days the matter will be submitted for resolution to the Chief Executive Officer of Cepheid and the President of ABI's Applied Biosystems Group.  In the event that the Presidents of each Party cannot reach agreement within 10 business days after receiving notice from the Joint Steering Committee, which period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties, then either Party may initiate mediation to resolve the matter in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in Exhibit <U>13.18</U>.</P>

<P>4.3.5&#9;<U>Records of Decisions.</U>  It is anticipated that significant decisions of the Joint Steering Committee, such as approval of budgets, will be reflected in written minutes of meetings that will be circulated to all Joint Steering Committee members for review and comment before being filed as final records of the Joint Steering Committee.</P>

<P>4.3.6  <U>Expenses</U> The Parties will each bear all expenses of their respective members related to their participation on the Joint Steering Committee.</P>

If Cepheid elects not to prepare, file, prosecute or maintain certain of the patent applications or any claims encompassed within the patent applications, in one or more countries, Cepheid will give ABI notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing the patents or claims to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and ABI will thereafter have the right, at its sole expense and discretion, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain the patent applications or, by means of continuations in part, divisionals or other appropriate methods, claims, in the name of ABI in the one or more countries.  Cepheid will, at ABI's expense, assign the patent applications and claims to ABI and provide reasonable assistance to ABI to facilitate the filing and prosecution of all the patent applications or claims that Cepheid has elected not to pursue, and Cepheid will execute all documents reasonably deemed necessary or desirable by ABI therefor. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, ABI will provide to Cepheid a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license, with right to sublicense, under all the patent applications and claims that Cepheid has elected not to pursue and ABI has elected to pursue under this Section 5.2.1.  If claims describing Collaboration Cepheid Intellectual Property are combined in a patent application with claims describing Background Cepheid Intellectual Property that is not Collaboration Cepheid Intellectual Property, ABI's rights under this Section 5.2.1 will be limited to those claims describing Collaboration Cepheid Intellectual Property.  ABI and Cepheid will each hold all information it presently knows or acquires under this Section 5.2.1 as Confidential Information in accordance with Section 8.</P>

<P>5.2.2  <U>Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property.</U> ABI will have the first right, using in-house or outside legal counsel selected by ABI's sole discretion, to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain and extend patent applications for Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property in countries of ABI's choosing.  ABI will bear all costs relating to such activities.  ABI will solicit Cepheid's advice and review of the patent applications, and ABI will take into consideration Cepheid's advice thereon, but whether to implement such advice shall be in ABI's sole discretion.  If ABI elects not to prepare, file, prosecute or maintain certain of the patent applications or any claims encompassed within the patent applications, in one or more countries, ABI will give Cepheid notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing the patents or claims to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and Cepheid will thereafter have the right, at its sole expense and discretion, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain the patent applications or, by means of continuations in part, divisionals or other appropriate methods, claims, in the name of Cepheid  in the one or more countries.  ABI will, at Cepheid's expense, assign said patent applications to Cepheid  and provide reasonable assistance to Cepheid to facilitate the filing and prosecution of all the patent applications and claims that ABI has elected not to pursue, and ABI will execute all documents reasonably deemed necessary or desirable by Cepheid therefor.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, Cepheid will provide to ABI a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license, with right to sublicense, under all the patent applications that ABI has elected not to pursue and Cepheid  has elected to pursue under this Section 5.2.2.  If claims describing Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property are combined in a patent application with claims describing Background Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property that is not Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property, Cepheid's rights under this Section 5.2.2 will be limited to those claims describing Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property.  ABI and Cepheid will each hold all information it presently knows or acquires under this Section 5.2.2 as Confidential Information in accordance with Section 8.</P>

<P>5.2.3  <U>Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property</U>. ABI and Cepheid will jointly have the right, using in-house or outside legal counsel selected by both Parties, to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain and extend patent applications for Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property in countries of the Party's choosing.  But, if the practice of the Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property would necessarily infringe claims of patents or patent applications claiming Background ABI Intellectual Property, the Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property will, for the purposes of this Section 5.2.3 only, be treated as Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property under Section 5.2.2; and, if the practice of the Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property would necessarily infringe claims of patents or patent applications claiming Background Cepheid Intellectual Property, the Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property will, for the purposes of this Section 5.2.3 only, be treated as  Collaboration Cepheid Intellectual Property under Section 5.2.1.  If only one Party (&quot;Filing Party&quot;) desires to file a patent application in one or more countries, then the Filing Party will thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain the applications in its own name in the one or more countries; and the other Party will, at its own expense, assign said patent applications to the Filing Party and provide reasonable assistance to the Filing Party to facilitate the filing and prosecution of all the patent applications that the other Party has elected not to pursue, and the other Party will execute all reasonable documents deemed  necessary or desirable by the Filing Party therefor.  The Filing Party will provide to the other Party a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual  non-exclusive license, with right to sublicense, under all the patent applications that the other Party has elected not to pursue and the Filing Party has elected to pursue under this Section 5.2.3.

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>5.4.1  <U>Defense Against Third Party Claims; Sharing of Costs for Certain Third Party Infringement Claims</U>.  In the event of the institution of any suit by a Third Party against Cepheid or ABI alleging that the manufacture, use, sale, distribution or marketing of Products pursuant to this Agreement infringes a Third Party patent, the Party sued will promptly notify the other Party in writing.  If the infringement claimed in the suit is an infringement claim with respect to which one Party indemnifies the other Party pursuant to Section 11.4.1 or 11.5.1, and the Party providing the indemnification accepts its indemnification obligation in a writing to the other Party, the Party affording the indemnification shall have the right to defend the suit, as set forth in Section 11.  In addition, whether or not such Party accepts its indemnification obligation in writing, the Party that indemnifies the other pursuant to Section 11.4.1 or 11.5.1 shall be fully responsible for such claim in accordance with Section 11.4.1 or 11.5.1, as the case may be.  If the claim of infringement is not a claim with respect to which one Party indemnifies the other Party pursuant to Section 11.4.1 or 11.5.1, the Parties shall cooperate and select mutually agreeable counsel to defend the claim on behalf of both Parties; and each Party shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of defense, and of any damages that may be finally awarded.  If one Party pays more than fifty percent (50%) of any such defense costs or damages at any time (such as, for example, if one Party but not the other pays an invoice from defense counsel), the other Party shall reimburse the paying Party a sufficient amount so that it shall have paid fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor.  No amounts paid by a Party in the defense of any such suit, or to pay any damages, shall be deducted from Net Sales for the purposes of determining Residual Revenue.  The Parties will cooperate in the defense of the suit, and shall jointly instruct defense counsel.  However, if the Parties cannot agree with respect to any matter regarding such defense, ABI shall have the right to determine the matter, and Cepheid may obtain counsel of its choosing, at its expense, to defend its interests in the claim, and neither Party shall have any obligation to reimburse the other for costs of defense incurred after the date counsel for Cepheid enters its appearance; provided, that if the matter is a claim covered by subsection (iv) of Section 11.6A that involves primarily Cartridges and/or GeneXpert Modules, then Cepheid rather than ABI shall have the right to determine the matter, and ABI may obtain counsel of its choosing, at its expense, to defend its interests in the claim, and neither Party shall have any obligation to reimburse the other for costs of defense incurred after the date counsel for ABI enters its appearance.  However, the Parties shall each remain responsible for one half of any infringement damages awarded on account of the manufacture or sale of Products pursuant to this Agreement, except with respect to claims with respect to which one Party indemnifies the other Party pursuant to Section  11.4.1 or 11.5.1, as set forth above.  Each other Party will have the right but not the obligation to defend or participate in the defense of such suit, in addition to the counsel representing both Parties, at its own expense.  Cepheid and ABI will assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other's reasonable request without expense to the requesting Party.  A Party defending any such action alone will have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof; however, no<B> </B>settlement of an action<B> </B>will be made without the prior written consent of the other Party if such settlement<B> </B>would adversely affect the rights of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</P>

<P>5.4.2  <U>Prosecution of Infringement Action</U>.  In the event that Cepheid or ABI becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a patent resulting from Collaboration Cepheid Intellectual Property, Collaboration ABI Intellectual Property, or Collaboration Joint Intellectual Property, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing.  Either owner of a patent resulting from the intellectual property will have the first right but not the obligation to bring, at its own expense, an infringement action against any Third Party and to use the other Party's name in connection therewith.  If an owner of the patent does not commence a particular infringement action within 90 days, the other Party, after notifying the owner in writing, will be entitled to bring the infringement action at its own expense.  The Party conducting the action will have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof.  But, no<B> </B>settlement of an action<B> </B>will be made without the prior written consent of the other Party if such settlement<B> </B>would adversely affect the rights of the other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, Cepheid and ABI will assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other's reasonable request without expense to the requesting Party, and, if a Party is necessary in order to institute or maintain an infringement suit by the other Party as defined by law, that Party will join such suit, represented by its own counsel.</P>

<P>5.4.3  <U>Expenses</U>. Cepheid and ABI have the right to first recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses, or proportionate share thereof, in connection with any litigation or settlement thereof from any recovery made by any Party.  Any excess amount will be shared between ABI and Cepheid in an amount proportional to their respective out-of-pocket expenses.</P>

<P>5.4.4  <U>Information</U>. The Parties will keep one another reasonably informed of the status of their respective activities regarding any such litigation or settlement thereof.</P>

</DIR>

<P>5.5  <U>Effect of Bankruptcy</U>. All rights and licenses granted under this Agreement by one Party to the other Party are, and will irrevocably be deemed to be, &quot;intellectual property&quot; as defined in Section 101(56) of Title 11, U.S. Code  (&quot;Bankruptcy Code&quot;).  In the event of the commencement of a case by or against either Party under any Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, this Agreement will be deemed an executory contract and all rights and obligations hereunder will be determined in accordance with Section 365(n) thereof.</P>

<P>5.6  <U>Branding, Trademarks and Non-Proprietary Names</U>.  Products distributed to end users will be branded in such a manner that both Party's logotypes will appear with approximately equal weight and size on all packaging, product inserts and accompanying literature, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise agreed, the logotypes and brands on Products will appear approximately as follows on all packaging, labels and product inserts:</P>

<P>All representations of a Party's Marks that the other Party intends to use will first be submitted to such other Party for approval (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of design, color and other details.  The Joint Steering Committee, at equally shared expense between each Party, will be responsible for the selection, registration and maintenance of all trademarks that it employs to name or identify Products, and both Parties will own and control such trademarks jointly.  Each Party hereby grants to the other Party a non-exclusive right and license to use the marks, trade names (including without limitation the names &quot;Cepheid&quot; and &quot;Applied Biosystems&quot;) and logos (collectively, &quot;Marks&quot;) that the Parties by mutual agreement may employ from time to time with respect to Products in connection with Cepheid's contract manufacture and ABI's sale and distribution of Products.  Except as set forth in this Section 5.6, nothing contained in this Agreement will grant to either Party any right, title or interest Marks of the other Party.  Each Party hereby agrees to defend and indemnify the other Party and hold it harmless against claims by a Third Party that the use by the other Party of a Mark owned by a Party in a manner expressly authorized by such Party in writing infringes intellectual property rights of such Third Party.</P>

<B><P>6.  PCR and Thermal Cycler Licensing, Royalties to Roche, to ABI, and to Third Parties</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
</B><P>6.1 <U>General Explanation of ABI's Licensing Program</U>.  PCR is a proprietary technology covered by several U.S. patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, and 4,965,188, and by issued and pending counterpart patents outside the U.S that are licensed to ABI or its Affiliates.  These patents are owned by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of the F. Hoffmann La Roche Company, and are exclusively licensed to the Applera Corporation for automated practice in the field of research and other applications other than human diagnostics.  Certain sublicenses to these patents are administered through Applera Corporation's ABI Group.  These sublicenses under the PCR process patents are for automated performance of the PCR process for research and for other designated fields, and include as one component an up-front fee payable for each thermal cycler used to perform the PCR process.  This establishes a Thermal Cycler "Authorization".  The expression "Authorized" means that the user's up-front license fee has been paid.  ABI grants rights to thermal cycler manufacturers to include the Authorization with their thermal cyclers, and to permit manufacturers to sell their instruments for PCR and to promote their instruments as "Authorized for PCR".  Under the terms of ABI's license, manufacturers who pay the fee do not induce infringement by promoting and advertising their instruments for PCR, selling to PCR users and supporting such use.  In addition, ABI owns patents that disclose and claim PCR thermal cycler apparatus, automated methods for performing PCR in thermal cyclers, and systems comprising thermal cyclers loaded with PCR reagents and programmed to perform a PCR protocol.  A number of these patents have issued to Applera in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.  The running-royalty component of the PCR license required for a user to perform internal research and development activities is obtained through the user's purchase and use of thermostable polymerase purchased from a manufacturer licensed by Roche to sell such polymerase.  The rights under this component of this license are conveyed generally through a label license accompanying the polymerase.</P>

<P>6.2  <U>Application of the PCR Licensing Program to this Agreement</U>.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>6.2.1&#9;<U>Background Information</U>.  The right to perform PCR-based services in any of the fields under which ABI has PCR rights (which include environmental testing such as the bio-threat testing described in this Agreement performed by Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems) requires additional rights beyond those conveyed by the use of a licensed polymerase with an Authorized Thermal Cycler.  Those rights can be obtained either directly from ABI or through the purchase of products bearing a valid label license conveying the necessary rights.   Additionally, because Products employ the 5' nuclease detection assay, other rights not conveyed through ABI's basic PCR licensing program must be otherwise conveyed to the end user.  At the present time there is no program in place to offer separate licenses or authorizations for the performance of the 5' nuclease detection assay.  As a result, the rights to perform PCR in conjunction with the 5' nuclease detection assay under this Agreement will be provided to the USPS<B> </B>exclusively through such end user's purchase of Products comprised of ABI PCR Materials packaged in a Cartridge and designed for use with Cepheid's GeneXpert instrument, which is an Authorized Thermal Cycler.</P>

<P>6.2.2 <U>Licensing of Reagents.</U>  All PCR rights held by ABI required to perform the assays for which Products are promoted and sold will be provided as part of the purchase of Products, and will be reflected in a label license accompanying Products sold to the USPS.</P>

<P>6.2.3 <U>Licensing of Thermal Cycling Instruments.</U>  As stated above, the GeneXpert instrument is an Authorized Thermal Cycler under AB's Thermal Cycler Supplier licensing program.  The label license authorized by ABI provided with such instrument defines the instrument as an Authorized Thermal Cycler under the basic PCR process patents.  [***]</P>

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (&quot;Roche&quot;), has an up-front fee component and a running-royalty component. The purchase price of this Bio-threat Agent Detection Kit (Part No. ______ ) includes limited, non-transferable rights under the running-royalty component to use only this amount of that product to practice the Polymerase Chain Reaction (&quot;PCR&quot;) and related processes described in said patents solely for bio-threat agent environmental detection and research activities of the purchaser when this product is used in conjunction with a thermal cycler whose use is covered by the up-front fee component. Rights to the up-front fee component must be obtained by the end user in order to have a complete license. These rights under the up-front fee component may be purchased from Applied Biosystems or obtained by purchasing an Authorized Thermal Cycler. The right to use this product to perform and to offer commercial services for bio-threat agent environmental detection applications, using PCR, including reporting results of purchaser's activities for a fee or other commercial consideration, is also granted with the purchase of said product.

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>6.4.1  <U>Roche Royalties</U>.  Payment of any and all royalty payments due to Roche on account of the manufacture and sale of Products pursuant to this Agreement will be the responsibility of ABI. [***] the royalty to be paid to Roche by ABI is[***]</P>

<P>6.4.2  <U>ABI Royalties</U>.  Cepheid will be responsible for maintaining its Thermal Cycler Supplier Agreement (&quot;TCSUP&quot;) in good standing through prompt payment of all royalties due as well as compliance with other provisions of the TCSUP.  [***]</P>

<P>6.4.3  <U>Royalties Due Other Third Parties</U>.  If either Party believes that a license or other right is required from a Third Party, or that the payment of royalties or other consideration is required to be made to, a Third Party, to obtain Intellectual Property Rights to manufacture, sell or import Products, such Party shall notify the other Party.  The matter will be presented to the Joint Steering Committee for consideration, and the Parties shall confer with respect to the matter to seek to agree as to whether any such rights are required and, if they agree that they are, how to obtain such rights.  However, if the Parties do not agree, either Party may seek to obtain such rights on such terms and conditions as such Party in its sole discretion deems necessary and appropriate.  The Party seeking to obtain such rights shall keep the other Party reasonably informed on a concurrent basis of the status of discussions and negotiation with the Third Party, will accurately respond to questions regarding such negotiations and their status, will counsel with and seek the advice of the other Party with respect to such negotiations, and will promptly furnish such other Party with copies of all material written (including electronic) communications with the Third Party, with copies of all drafts of agreements or other documents setting forth commitments or proposed commitments, and a copy of any executed agreement set forth the terms for the obtaining of any such rights, and all documents setting forth related agreements, commitments or understandings.  The Party that did not enter into such agreement will reimburse the other Party [***] of any net amounts paid to such Third Party to obtain such rights within forty five (45) days after receipt of an invoice therefor.  If such agreement affords rights other than solely rights to manufacture and/or sell Products subject to and pursuant to this Agreement, the reimbursing Party shall only be required to reimburse the other [***] [***]of the fair market value, determined as of the effective date of such agreement with the Third Party, of the proportionate value that the rights granted to manufacture and/or sell Products subject to and pursuant to this Agreement bear to the totality of rights granted pursuant to such agreement with the Third Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such rights are sought to be obtained from an Affiliate of a Party, no such agreement will be entered into with such Affiliate without the written consent of both Parties.  Neither the royalties or other amounts paid by the Party entering into such Agreement with the Third Party to obtain such rights, nor the amounts paid by the other Party to reimburse such Party[***], shall be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the license or other rights obtained are rights as to which one Party has indemnified the other pursuant to Section 11.4.1 or 11.5.1, then each Party shall only be required to reimburse the other Party [***]of such payment out of [***]received by the reimbursing Party.  For the purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that neither Party shall be required to reimburse the other Party for any amounts except amounts paid to obtain any such rights with respect to Products sold pursuant to this Agreement.  In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Party shall be required under this Section 6.4.3 to reimburse the other party for punitive, multiple or similar damages, or costs of defending any action or proceeding.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6.5&#9;No Express or Implied License.  It is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement, the Cartridge Packing Agreement or the Distribution Agreement shall be deemed to grant to Cepheid a right or license to manufacture ABI PCR Materials or to practice any claims of the PCR Rights.  The foregoing shall not be deemed to limit Cepheid's rights to properly use properly labeled Materials as an end user, or Cepheid's rights under its TCSUP with ABI.</P>

</B><U><LI>Exclusivity</U>.  During the term of this Agreement, neither Party nor its Affiliates directly or indirectly will market, sell, or distribute any Products containing ABI PCR Materials, or Products the manufacture, sale or use of which would require PCR Rights, to the USPS or for use by or for the benefit of the USPS for the detection of anthrax or other bio-threat agents that the Parties have agreed in writing are intended to be detected by Products except in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</LI></OL>
</OL>


<P>7.2&#9;<U>No Implied Licenses</U>.  No license or other right is granted or is to be construed as being granted hereunder by one Party to the other Party, whether express, implied, or by estoppel, to any Intellectual Property Rights, or to trademark, trade dress, or service mark rights, or any other intellectual property rights, owned, used, licensed to, or otherwise controlled by, a Party, except solely for the purposes of manufacturing and selling Products to or for the use of the USPS as expressly set forth in this Agreement.</P>
<B>
</B><P>7.3&#9;<U>Sales of Products; Approval of Sales Agreement</U>.   Cepheid shall be responsible for sales of Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems, including as a distributor of Products purchased from ABI, to the USPS, either directly or through Northrop-Grumman or another Third Party selected by Cepheid.  Cepheid will use commercially reasonable efforts to execute a sales agreement covering the sales of Products to or for the use of the USPS (that is, an agreement covering Products but not GeneXpert Modules, which Cepheid will seek to make the subject of a separate agreement). [***] Cepheid shall not under any circumstances enter into any agreement with the USPS or any Third Party or any other party, and any amendment of any such agreement entered into, for the sale or other distribution of Products without the express written consent of ABI.  Cepheid will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such agreement to name ABI as a named third-party beneficiary under the Agreement.  Cepheid shall deliver copies of drafts of any proposed agreement covering Products to ABI for review and comment, and shall deliver to ABI, at least [***]before execution thereof by the parties thereto, or such shorter time to which ABI may agree, the final proposed form of such Agreement.  [***]Cepheid shall promptly notify ABI of any claim of breach of such agreement by the USPS, Northrop Grumman, or the Thirty Party thereto, and promptly furnish to ABI copies of any writing notifying Cepheid of or relating to any such breach.  Any sales agreement shall provide that Cepheid be informed of the price of Products to the USPS, the end-user, so that Cepheid may inform ABI, as ABI's royalty to Roche is based on such price.</P>

<P>7.4&#9;<U>Sales Forecasts</U>.  In its role as distributor of Products to the USPS, Cepheid shall immediately prior to the beginning of each Quarter provide to ABI a rolling forecast of projected sales for each of four quarters into the future.  These forecasts will be based on reasonable commercial efforts by Cepheid to estimate future sales, and will be updated at the beginning of each month for the current quarter.  </P>

<P>7.5.&#9;<U>Pricing</U>.  The price for Products to the USPS, or Northrop-Grumman or other Third Party, as the case may be, shall be determined by Cepheid in its sole discretion.  If Products are sold together with GeneXpert Modules, or as part of Bio-Threat Agent Detection Systems, the price paid for Products to be used in the determination of Net Sales shall be deemed<U> </U>to be the higher of any price for the Products that is separately stated in connection with the sale, Cepheid's then retail list price for the Products sold, or the Net Sales amount received for the sale less the deemed price of the GeneXpert Modules sold, with such deemed price being the higher of Cepheid's retail list price therefor or the average price paid for the then most recent five GeneXpert Modules sold as independent units.</P>

<P>7.6&#9;<U>Value Sharing.</U>  Payment to ABI of [***]Promotional Products.  Each Party shall be entitled to [***]realized upon the sale of Products.  It is understood and agreed that ABI will appoint Cepheid as its distributor of Products to the USPS, or to a Third Party for resale to and use by the USPS, pursuant to the terms of the Distributor Agreement.  Accordingly, the Parties agree that to administer the above value sharing agreement, [***]It is understood and agreed that Cepheid may distribute products for no or for de-minimus consideration for promotional or testing purposes.  Cepheid agrees that the amount of Products distributed for such purposes in any twelve (12) months period shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the aggregate number of Products sold for more than de-minimus consideration during such twelve (12) month period, unless ABI otherwise agrees.  It is also understood and agreed that certain Products or parts thereof may be furnished to the USPS or its designees for validation purposes, with or without consideration, and nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to restrict Cepheid from providing a reasonable amount or number of Products or parts thereof for such purposes.</P>

<P>7.7&#9;<U>Cap on Manufacturing Cost.</U>  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, for the purposes of [***]The Parties understand and agree that the initial Cartridge for the anthrax assay is capable of effectively performing one assay for one bio-threat agent, namely, anthrax.

<P>7.8&#9;<U>Reimbursement and Payment Process</U>.  Prior to the shipment of any revenue-generating Products, and on or about each anniversary thereafter on a date set by the Joint Steering Committee, and at any time there is a significant change in a Product being shipped, each Party will make a good faith estimate of [***]  Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Quarter, Cepheid will submit to ABI a written itemized accounting and report of Products sales, Manufacturing Costs and royalties paid containing such information as ABI may reasonably request from time to time, but at a minimum setting forth the number and types of Products sold during the Quarter, the net amount billed therefor, the revenue received, [***]Based on that report, Cepheid will calculate the actual amount due to each Party and depending on the results either pay any balance due to ABI within forty five (45) days after the end of the Quarter, or issue an invoice to ABI for moneys due, which invoice ABI shall pay within thirty (30) days of receipt.</P>

<P>7.9&#9;<U>Books and Records; Audit</U>.  Using a Party's customary practices and procedures in accordance with GAAP, each Party will keep and maintain proper and complete records and books of account sufficient in detail to enable the verification of monies spent and received by each Party, and Manufacturing Cost of and subject royalties paid by each Party, in connection with each Party's obligations under this Agreement.  The books and records will be retained for a period of at least 6 years after the end of the period for which such books and records pertain. Each Party will have the right from time to time (not to exceed once per calendar year) during normal business hours and upon 2 weeks prior written notice, to inspect in confidence, or have an agent, accountant or other representative inspect in confidence, such books and records of the other Party.  The Party initiating the inspection will bear the costs thereof unless the inspection reveals a discrepancy unfavorable to that Party of at least 10%, in which case the other Party will pay the costs of the inspection.  If the inspection results in a final determination that amounts have been overstated or understated, the applicable amount will be refunded or paid promptly by the appropriate Party. The inspecting Party will treat all information learned in the course of any audit or inspection as Confidential Information, and will maintain such Confidential Information in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary for the Party to reveal such information in order to enforce its rights under this Agreement or if disclosure is required by law.  Any public accounting firm shall sign a customary confidentiality agreement as a condition precedent to their inspection, and shall report to the inspecting Party only its conclusion with such other information at the firm deems necessary by way of explanation.</P>

<B><P>8.  Confidentiality</P>

</B><P>8.1&#9;<U>Non-Disclosure; Non-Use</U>.  Because Cepheid and ABI will be cooperating with each other under this Agreement, each may reveal Confidential Information to the other.  The Parties agree, by using the same degree of care as each uses for its own information of like importance, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to hold in confidence any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party hereunder, and not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party to any Third Party or, except as provided below, to any Affiliate, and not to use any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party hereunder for any purpose other than carrying out its obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, furthering the Joint Development Program and this Collaboration), without the express written consent of the other Party.  Each Party will disclose Confidential Information only to its employees or agents who have a need to know same for such purpose.  With respect to any Confidential Information that is revealed by a Party to the other Party, the confidentiality and non-use requirements of this Section 8 will remain in force for a period of 5 years following the date the Confidential Information is disclosed, or 2 years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, whichever is later.</P>

<P>8.2&#9;<U>Responsibility over Employees and Agents</U>.  Each Party will assume individual responsibility for the actions and omissions of its respective employees, agents and assigns, and to inform same of the responsibilities for confidentiality and non use under this Agreement, and to obtain their agreement to be bound in the same manner that the Party is bound.</P>

<P>8.3&#9;<U>Affiliates</U>. Nothing herein will be construed as preventing either Party from disclosing any information to an Affiliate of ABI or Cepheid for the purpose of furthering the Joint Development Program or carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, provided such Affiliate has undertaken a similar obligation of confidentiality and non use with respect to the Confidential Information.</P>

<P>8.4&#9;<U>Bankruptcy</U>. All Confidential Information disclosed by one Party to the other will remain the intellectual property of the disclosing Party.  A bankrupt or insolvent Party will, to the extent permitted by law, take all steps necessary or desirable to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party's Confidential Information and to ensure that any court or other tribunal maintain such information in confidence in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that a court or other legal or administrative tribunal, directly or through an appointed master, trustee or receiver, assumes partial or complete control over the assets of a Party based on the insolvency or bankruptcy of such Party, the bankrupt or insolvent Party will promptly notify the court or other tribunal </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>8.4.1  that Confidential Information received from the other Party under this Agreement remains the property of the other Party; and, </P>
<P>8.4.2  of the confidentiality and non use obligations under this Agreement.</P>
<U></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>8.5&#9;<U>Publication.</U> Neither ABI nor Cepheid will submit for written or oral publication any manuscript, abstract or the like that includes data or other information generated and provided by the other Party or otherwise developed by either Party under the Joint Development Program without first obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  If written consent or written denial is not provided by the other Party within 90 days, the first Party will have the right to publish.  But, the foregoing will not apply to customary literature that is prepared for marketing and sales purposes and that does not contain Confidential Information of the non publishing Party.</P>

<P>8.6&#9;<U>Compliance with Statutory Requirements</U>. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as preventing or in any way inhibiting either Party from complying with statutory or regulatory requirements governing the development, manufacture, use, sale, or other distribution, of Products in any manner that it reasonably deems appropriate, including, for example, by disclosing to regulatory authorities Confidential Information or other information received from a Party or Third Parties.  However, the Parties will take reasonable measures to assure that no unauthorized use or disclosure is made by persons or entities to whom access to such information is granted under this Section 8.6.</P>

<P>8.7&#9;<U>Non-Solicitation</U>.  During the term of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, a Party will not solicit any person who is employed by or is an exclusive consultant to the other Party and directly involved with the Joint Development Program or this Collaboration to terminate that person's employment by or consultancy to the other Party.  As used herein, the term &quot;solicit&quot; will mean requesting, directly or indirectly, any employee or consultant to terminate his employment by or consultancy to a Party. </P>

<P>8.8&#9;<U>Compelled Disclosure</U>. In the event that a Party (&quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will provide prompt prior written notice of such compulsion to the other Party, so that the other Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, if appropriate, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Disclosing Party will disclose only that portion of Confidential Information that it is advised by opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed, or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, and will exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment required hereby will be accorded such Confidential Information; and the Disclosing Party will not be liable for such disclosure unless such disclosure was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by the Disclosing Party not permitted by this Agreement.</P>

<P>11.6A <U>Shared ABI -- Cepheid Intellectual Property Indemnity</U>.</P>

<P>Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 11.6A, each of ABI and Cepheid agrees, for itself and its respective Affiliates, to defend the other Party and its Affiliates, and ETG or Northrop Grumman if either of them act and ETG and Northrop Grumman if both of them act, to purchase and resell Products to the USPS (individually, a &quot;Shared Released Party,&quot; collectively, the &quot;Shared Released Parties&quot;), [***]from any claim, demand or cause of action in, and to indemnify and hold harmless the Shared Released Parties from and against any Liabilities resulting from, any legal action or proceeding brought by a Third Party against a Shared Released Party to the extent that such action or proceeding is based on a claim that (i) the manufacture or sale by Cepheid of Other Chemical Materials pursuant to this Agreement for Authorized Use by the USPS in the Bio-Threat Detection System infringes [***]), (ii) The procedures set forth in Section 5.4.1 shall govern the obligations of the Parties for claims covered by this Section 11.6A.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>11.6B.&#9;[***]</P>

<P>11.7  <U>Effect of Uncured Breach on Indemnification Obligations</U>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be obligated to indemnify the other Party under this Section 11 in the event that the Party seeking indemnification shall have committed a material breach of this Agreement, and the Party from whom indemnification hereunder is sought gives the breaching Party notice of such breach and an opportunity to cure such material breach within 60 days pursuant to Section 9.2.4, and such material breach remains uncured upon the expiration of such period.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>11.8&#9;<U>Notice; Choice of Attorney</U>.  A Party that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (the &quot;Indemnitee&quot;) will promptly notify the other Party (the &quot;Indemnitor&quot;) of any Liability in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim indemnification.  The Indemnitor, after it determines that indemnification is required of it, will assume the defense and settlement thereof with counsel of its choice, reasonably satisfactory to the other Party.  An Indemnitee will have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnitor if Indemnitor does not assume the defense or if representation of such Indemnitee by the counsel retained by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnitee and any other Party represented by counsel.  The Indemnitee's failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to Indemnitor's ability to defend the action, will relieve the Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 11, but the omission to deliver notice to the Indemnitor will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section 11.</P>

<P>11.9&#9;<U>Consent Required</U>.  The indemnity provisions in this Section 11 will not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Liability if the settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor. In addition, neither Party shall enter into any settlement or otherwise resolve any infringement matter in a manner that would adversely impact the business of the other Party or in any manner limit the other Party's rights without such Party's prior written consent.</P>

<P>11.10&#9;<U>Cooperation</U>.  The Indemnitee under this Section 11, its employees and agents, will cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigations of any action, claim or liability covered by this indemnification.  In the event that each Party claims indemnity from the other and one Party is finally held liable to indemnify the other, the Indemnitor will additionally be liable to pay the reasonable legal costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Indemnitee in establishing its claim for indemnity.</P>

<LI>The parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the controversy, as set forth in Section 13.18</LI>

<LI>If the parties do not resolve the dispute within 45 days of undertaking negotiation thereof, either Party may refer the Dispute for mediation by JAMS or its successor by providing to JAMS and the other Party a written request for mediation, setting forth the details of the dispute and the relief requested.  Each Party must then participate in the mediation in good faith and share equally in its costs.  The mediation will be conducted in accordance with JAMS mediation rules and procedures by: (i) a mediator agreed by the parties selected from JAMS' panel of neutrals; or (ii) if the parties do not agree on a mediator, a mediator nominated by JAMS.  All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. </LI>
<LI>If the dispute has not been resolved by non-binding means as provided herein within 90 days of the initiation of such procedure, either Party may pursue available remedies, including litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties are not able to agree upon the cap for manufacturing costs as set forth in Section 7.7 through negotiation or mediation, then such matter shall be subject to binding arbitration.  Either Party may initiate arbitration with respect to such matters at any time following the period provided for mediation, or determination by the mediator that the parties will not be able to resolve the issue through mediation, by filing a written request for arbitration to JAMS in accordance with JAMS arbitration procedures.</LI>
<LI>Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall have right before or during negotiation or mediation to seek and obtain from the appropriate court provisional remedies such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the status quo or preserve the subject matter of the negotiations or mediation.</LI></OL>
