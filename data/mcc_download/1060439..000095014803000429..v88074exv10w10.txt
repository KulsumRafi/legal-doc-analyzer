EXECUTION VERSION

                           If Microsoft fails to deliver the Minimum Queries
                           rendering to the URL http://search.msn.fr before July
                           1, 2003, then the Guaranteed Phase for MSN France
                           will extend until all such guaranteed Minimum Queries
                           are delivered (the "Guaranteed Phase Extension for
                           MSN France"). During the Guaranteed Phase Extension
                           for MSN France, Company will not be required to make
                           any additional Guaranteed Payments, but Company will
                           continue to be required to make Revenue Share
                           Payments. Once the Guaranteed Phase for MSN France
                           has concluded, Company shall pay Microsoft pursuant
                           to Section 3.2.2 for Gross Revenue from the MSN
                           Search Site in France.
