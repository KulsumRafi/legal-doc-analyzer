<p ALIGN="LEFT">People you Know </p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are pleased to share with you our Annual Report for 2002.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the past year, one of our more recognizable and well-received
advertising campaigns used the theme &quot;Experience You Can Trust&quot;. In this report
we are again emphasizing the depth and breadth of the Bar Harbor Bankshares team and how
that experience can be counted upon to deliver the professional advice and counsel our
customers seek. We hope you, the shareholder, also recognizes the value our collective
experience brings to the stewardship of your company, and we have chosen that notion as
the theme of this report. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite some unsettling economic factors, 2002 was a year marked by strong
growth and resurging profitability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2002 Net Income was $4.6 million, an increase of 30% over 2001</li>
  <li>Total Loans grew 18% to $352 million</li>
  <li>Deposits grew 10% to $322 million</li>
  <li>Assets grew by $67 million, or 14%, to $554 million</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A sustained period of historically low interest rates fueled unprecedented
demand for new and refinanced home mortgages and home equity loans. This demand tested our
capacity to manage high volume while maintaining service quality, and we are happy to
report that we are more than up to the task. Delivering mortgages and consumer loans with
speed, accuracy and responsiveness has become a hallmark of our franchise and one we will
continue to develop. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As we&#146;ve been pleased to report throughout the year, asset quality
has remained strong. Delinquency, non-performing loans, and charge-offs were at low levels
throughout 2002. We are quite pleased with this trend and view it as a solid platform upon
which to build our loan portfolios, both retail and commercial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sustained bear market that we have been experiencing since 2000
continues to present difficult challenges, exacerbated by global unrest and a lingering
soft economy still struggling to rebound. Our financial subsidiary, BTI Financial Group,
was tested by these conditions, as values of assets under management declined steadily in
2002, until stabilizing during the fourth quarter. While BTI posted a meaningful loss for
the year, we are very pleased with the skill, resolve and concern for our customers that
our team displayed while managing through difficult conditions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During 2002, issues of corporate governance took center stage nationally
in the aftermath of well-publicized breaches of trust by some high-profile corporate
leaders. As a result, all public corporations, including Bar Harbor Bankshares, will share
a legacy of increased public and regulatory scrutiny. We believe this is a healthy
development. Bar Harbor Bankshares, as most companies, has always embraced high standards
of accountability. We are eager to demonstrate that accountability by early and rigorous
adherence to new disclosure and certification regimens prescribed by Sarbanes-Oxley
legislation and related requirements. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the most fundamental aspects of the Bar Harbor Bankshares corporate
history is a commitment to high standards of citizenship in the communities we serve. This
past year was no exception. On behalf of all our constituents, we were delighted to make
meaningful financial contributions to worthy projects in an effort to reinforce the
quality of life available to all members of our communities. Beyond our financial support,
and perhaps even more significant, members of our corporate family donated untold hours of
volunteer energy to a wide variety of community service initiatives. Their generosity of
spirit has become a hallmark of our organization. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the forthcoming Annual Meeting, two long-time directors will retire
after years of dedicated service. Bob Gilfillan, now a member of the Bar Harbor Banking
and Trust Company board, has served in various board capacities since 1956 and is a former
Chair of the Bar Harbor Bankshares board. Bernard &quot;Sonny&quot; Cough has been a
member of the Bar Harbor Bankshares board since 1985 and has chaired a number of
committees. We will miss their wise counsel and their devotion to the Bar Harbor
Bankshares family. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For 2003, we have set high but realistic goals for ourselves. These goals
are based upon genuine core business opportunities in our markets and are achievable with
the staff, tools and skills we can deploy today. You can count upon us to stay focused
upon fundamentals and to make the most of these opportunities. We are blessed with many
assets; chief among these are: a skilled and dedicated staff, the loyalty of our customers
and the confidence of our shareholders. Our experience tells us that these are precious
assets that cannot be taken for granted. In 2003 and beyond, you can trust that we will do
everything in our power to fulfill your expectations of us. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">BAR HARBOR BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY 2002 YEAR IN REVIEW</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bar Harbor Banking and Trust Company recorded significant gains in 2002 in
many areas of the Bank that reflect well upon the efforts of our excellent team of
committed professionals. These gains also reflect the confidence of our customers, both
long-term and new, who value our approach to community banking. This approach is hardly
revolutionary---it is 115 years old this year----we listen, we help and we care.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following are highlights that this community banking approach has
produced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total average loans increased in 2002 by $42 million to $326 million, or 15%. This
    increase was led by a record year in residential mortgage originations, and we continue to
    be the local market leader in that category. While commercial loans remained relatively
    flat, we focused on building a higher quality loan portfolio by deepening existing
    relationships and attracting high-quality new business.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We continued to improve our asset quality, as detailed on page 13 of this Annual Report
    under the &quot;Provision for Loan Losses&quot; section. Global and economic uncertainties
    make it even more important that we keep our credit standards and asset quality high so
    that Bar Harbor Banking and Trust Company will continue to be in a strong position to
    support our customers and communities as we have for the last 115 years and counting.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Total average deposits increased nearly $24 million to $303 million, or an 8% increase
    in 2002, with the mix shifting out of certificates of deposit and into demand and savings
    instruments. Two very successful products, our Preferred Choice checking account and our
    Investors Choice money market account, led deposit increases. Together, Preferred Choice
    and Investors Choice increased by nearly $26 million, or 65%, to $65 million.
    &quot;Choice&quot; is a theme in our deposit products, and this growth demonstrates that
    our customers believe the best choices are at Bar Harbor Banking and Trust Company.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We engaged an independent consulting firm in October to do a professional
shopping evaluation of our frontline customer service and sales skills. We are very proud
to tell you that our team members received excellent scores, well above peer norms. We
will continue these evaluations in the future, to maintain and improve our high levels of
customer service.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Good people are at the core of our success, and we have added talented new
people to our organization in 2002. Some of those new people, along with many of our
long-time members, are featured in the July 2002 Team Bankshares photograph on the
fold-out page at the back of this Annual Report.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We also know the fast, friendly, efficient service is a key to customer
satisfaction. At present, we are installing new automated loan processing systems designed
to eliminate redundant paperwork, which should enable our employees to be more efficient
and productive for our customers. A current success in our &quot;high-tech,
high-touch&quot; initiative is our On-Line Direct Internet banking program, now serving
over 2,000 customers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are a good neighbor as well a financial institution. As the Bank has
derived great benefit from the communities we serve, we are pleased to give back to those
communities on many different levels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During 2002 the Bank contributed a very generous $183,000 in donations to
not-for-profit and local charitable organizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our officers and employees back up our monetary commitment with an impressive volunteer
    spirit. They averaged over nine hours per month of community service, or more than 7,000
    hours total, in 2002. Our list of volunteer participation and projects is too extensive to
    list here, but includes numerous organizations in our Hancock and Washington County
    communities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We sponsor a Community Commitment Day each Friday whereby employees contribute a dollar
    or more to dress casually on that day. The Bank matches employee contributions, and a
    different location chooses the beneficiary of those funds each month. In 2002, Community
    Commitment Days contributed over $13,000 to various worthy individuals and charities in
    Down East Maine.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our 115 years of solid history at BHBT was built upon integrity, hard
work, and the unwavering understanding that our success is totally dependent on
&quot;helping our customers, communities, employees and shareholders achieve their
financial goals and dreams&quot;. Our team reinforces that mission every day by working to
understand our customers and their needs and helping them find appropriate financial
solutions. The results of those efforts continue to be apparent, not only in our improving
financial performance, but also in our tremendous level of teamwork, volunteerism and
community support. Down East Maine is a wonderful place to live and work, and we are proud
of our leadership role in helping to improve our communities&#146; quality of life with
&quot;Experience You Can Trust&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">BTI FINANCIAL GROUP 2002 YEAR IN REVIEW</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">BTI Financial Group offers comprehensive financial services in support of
Bar Harbor Bankshares&#146; mission to provide the full spectrum of financial solutions to
individual, commercial and not-for-profit clients. BTI takes a comprehensive and
sophisticated approach to full service financial management as we offer strong planning
capabilities such as trust, estate management and charitable funding techniques. Our
approach to wealth management services provides a complete team-based advisory approach
with access to a broad array of product solutions. Over the long term, this approach will
ensure the retention and development of valued relationships, and the enhanced corporate
profitability that follows. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By any standard, 2002 was a very challenging year for investors and asset
managers alike. The noted decline in technology and communication stocks was compounded by
weaknesses in many other sectors as well. Several high-profile corporate scandals, global
uncertainties and concerns about the continued economic and political threats of terrorism
have also undermined the confidence of investors. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under these trying conditions, we believe that the value of
relationship-driven advisors like BTI has never been more evident. We understand that our
core advantage is our commitment to talk with and listed to our clients. We did that
extensively in 2002, and we will do so going forward. We are in business to help our
clients manage their financial assets through the rigors of unpredictable market cycles.
By working closely with them, we are able to help our clients refine their investment
strategies, their time horizons and their risk tolerances. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In terms of financial performance, 2002 was a disappointing year for the
BTI units. With declines in the values of assets under management, and the reluctance of
brokerage customers to re-enter the market, BTI saw overall fee revenues decline by 31%
compared to 2001 levels. Given these fundamental challenges, BTI management responded by
paying close attention to managing capacity, improving efficiencies, enhancing our product
set and improving our service delivery standards. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Within Bar Harbor Trust Services, led by its President, Joseph Pratt, we
implemented numerous enhanced policies and procedures, customer care disciplines and
information management techniques to ensure that every aspect of our internal operation is
organized to deliver the highest possible level of client service while closely managing
expenses. During 2002, we made outreach to our clients our highest priority and committed
to defined &quot;service pledges&quot; to ensure frequent and effective communication to
all our clients. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Block Capital Management, led by President and Chief Investment Officer,
Brett Miller, CFA, manages discretionary assets on behalf of clients it shares with Bar
Harbor Trust Services. In 2002, Block devoted its energies to navigating the unusually
difficult conditions in the capital markets. We devoted much of 2002 to working with
clients to clarify investment goals and either confirm or redefine those goals in light of
rapidly changing market conditions, paying particular attention to asset allocation.
During 2002, Block also introduced its Optima product, which uses indexed exchange traded
funds as a passive alternative to actively managed investments. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dirigo Investments, Inc., BTI&#146;s brokerage subsidiary, welcomed its
new President, Scott Hays, in September 2002. Under Scott&#146;s leadership, Dirigo
diversified its product offerings to meet emerging demands from our customers. Among these
are increased client interest in fixed annuities and Long Term Care insurance. Dirigo also
launched an active campaign to assist small and mid-size businesses implement SIMPLE and
401(k) plans for their employees. This initiative has met with good success, and we
anticipate it will become a major aspect of Dirigo&#146;s business development activities
in 2003 and beyond. </p>

debut in 1993 and continues to support local not-for-profit organizations. The 2002
beneficiaries were the Hospice of Hancock County and the SPCA of Hancock County.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3 Bar Harbor Bankshares donated $1,000 to the City of Ellsworth&#146;s

record number of employees participate, and collected over 30 bags of garbage along the

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PAGE 12 &amp; PAGE 13</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Financial Overview</b> / 2002 Annual Report</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">BALANCE SHEET</b><i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Total Assets</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Company&#146;s total assets ended the year at $554 million,
representing growth of $67 million, or 14%, compared with 2001.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Loans</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Total loans at December 31, 2002 stood at $352 million, representing an
increase of $54 million, or 18%, compared with 2001. Loan growth was led by exceptionally
strong consumer real estate lending, with favorable interest rates and a healthy local
economy serving as a catalyst. Consumer real estate loans climbed $36 million during 2002,
or 24%, and ended the year at $185 million. Home equity loans grew to $34 million at
year-end, representing an increase of 61% compared with 2001.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Investment Securities</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The investment securities portfolio continued to serve as a key source of
revenue for the Company. The portfolio averaged $162 million in 2002, representing growth
of $10 million, or 7%, compared with 2001. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deposits</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Company&#146;s consumer and commercial deposit base continued to grow
in 2002, ending the year at $322 million, or 10% higher than 2001. Depositor preference
during 2002 appeared to be one of greater liquidity, given weakened economic and market
conditions. Deposit growth was led by money market and savings accounts, posting a
year-over-year increase of $18 million, or 20%. The growth in time deposits, excluding
brokered funds, slowed to 2% during 2002, presumably due to depositors&#146; hesitancy in
committing to longer-term fixed rate investments during a period of historically low
interest rates.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Borrowings</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Borrowings consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, and are
principally utilized to support the Company&#146;s investment securities portfolio and, to
a lesser extent, fund loan growth. They also provide a means to help manage balance sheet
interest rate risk. Average borrowed funds amounted to $157 million during 2002,
representing an increase of 21% compared with the prior year.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shareholders&#146; Equity</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Consistent with its long-term goal of operating a sound and profitable
organization, the Company continues to be &quot;well capitalized&quot; according to
regulatory standards. During 2002, the Company maintained its historically strong capital
position, which is vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a
solid foundation for future growth. At December 31, 2002, the Company&#146;s ratio of Tier
1 Capital to risk-weighted assets stood at 13.2% and its was well above regulatory
requirements.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</b><i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>INCOME STATEMENT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Net Income</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 amounted to $4.6 million,
or $1.40 per fully diluted share of capital stock, compared with $3.5 million or $1.06 per
fully diluted share in 2001, representing increases of 30% and 32%, respectively.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Net Interest Income</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Included in 2002 and 2001 net interest income was $1.5 million and $499
thousand of tax-exempt income from certain investments and loans, resulting in a reduction
in the Company's income tax expense of $613 thousand and $193 thousand, respectively. The
Company&#146;s net interest income, on a fully tax equivalent basis, amounted to $20.2
million in 2002, representing an increase of $1.9 million, or 10%, compared with 2001. The
increase in net interest income was attributed to $52 million in average earning asset
growth between periods. Despite historically low interest rates, including a significant
parallel decline in the Treasury yield curve, the 2002 net interest margin held relatively
stable on a year-over-year basis, declining seven basis points to 4.14%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(Graphic)</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Non-Interest Income</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Non-interest income amounted to $6.4 million in 2002, representing a
decline of $1.1 million, or 14.7%, compared with the prior year. These results were
principally attributed to revenue declines at BTI Financial Group, as fees generated from
the market value of assets under management and retail brokerage transactions were
impacted by depressed securities markets, troubled world economies, geo-political
uncertainties, and restrained investor confidence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(Graphic)</font></p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Non-Interest Expense</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Company&#146;s total non-interest expense amounted to $18.3 million in
2002, representing a decline of $153 thousand, or 1%, compared with 2001. Expense declines
were led by changes made at BTI Financial Group during 2002, aided by a one-time
restructuring charge taken during the fourth quarter of 2001 at BTI.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Provision For Loan Losses</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Company expensed a provision for loan losses totaling $1.1 million
during 2002, representing an amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at
the necessary level. The 2002 provision represented a decline of $900 thousand compared
with 2001.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Company continued to maintain its non-performing loans at
significantly lower levels than in prior years and attributes this improvement to the
strengthening of its credit administration processes and underwriting standards. At
December 31, 2002, total non-performing loans amounted to $1.2 million or 0.33% of total
loans, compared with $2.3 million or 0.79% at the same date last year. Net charge offs to
average loans amounted to 0.09% in 2002, compared with 0.73% in 2001. At December 31,
2002, the Company&#146;s reserve for loan losses expressed as a percent of non-performing
loans stood at 424%, compared with 178% at the same date last year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This report contains certain statements which may be considered to be
forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation and Reform Act of
1995 (the &quot;PSLRA&quot;). You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use
of words like &quot;strategy,&quot; &quot;expects,&quot; &quot;plans,&quot;
&quot;believes,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;estimates,&quot; &quot;intends,&quot;
&quot;projects,&quot; &quot;goals,&quot; &quot;targets,&quot; and other words of similar
meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. For these statements, the Company claims the protection of
the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. Investors are
cautioned that forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and therefore, the
Company cautions the reader that actual results could differ materially from those
expected to occur depending upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not
necessarily limited to, changes in interest rates, the performance of financial markets,
changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations and taxes, competition, industry
consolidation, credit risks and other factors. Some of the other factors that could cause
or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, Company expenses, loan
losses, rates charged on loans and earned investments, variances in the actual versus
projected growth of assets, return on assets and other non-interest income earned, as well
as other risk factors. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise.</i></font><font FACE="Times New Roman"></p>
