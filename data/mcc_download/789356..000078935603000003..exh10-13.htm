general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is
considered in a proceeding at law or at equity).</LI>
<LI>All of the Shares to be issued to the Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement,
when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="_Toc518788210"><A NAME="_Toc530816806"><A NAME="_Toc530817362"><A
NAME="_Toc530918994">The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of
which 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series A 8%

Other than as expressly set forth in the Shareholders' Agreement entered into as
of the date hereof by and among the Company and the Subscribers (the
&quot;Shareholders' Agreement&quot;), there are no contracts, arrangements or
other agreements with respect to voting, issuance, redemption, repurchase,
acquisition, sale or transfer of the capital stock or other securities of the
Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company, to which the Company, Flax or
Rosenfield is a party.  Except (i) as expressly created by the Shareholders'
Agreement, and (ii) for the subscription for Shares contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company has not granted any preemptive rights, registration
rights, subscriptions, calls, options, warrants, rights, convertible securities
or other agreements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or

convertible into or exchangeable for shares of such capital stock or other
securities of the Company, and there are no statutory obligations of the Company
to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or to sell, issue or otherwise transfer
any shares of such capital stock.</LI>
<LI>The Company does not own a freehold interest in any real property or any
option or right of first refusal or first offer to acquire real property.  The

Leases</U>&quot;) for the real property located at 3212 North Sepulveda
Boulevard, Suite A, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, and at 1334 Park View Avenue,
#200, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266.  Copies of the real property leases have been
made available to each Subscriber.  The Company Leases are valid, binding and in
full force and effect.  All rents and additional rents and other sums, deposits,
expenses and charges due on the Company Leases have been paid and the Company
has been in peaceable possession since the commencement of its original
possession under the Company Leases and no waiver, indulgence or postponement of
the Company's obligations thereunder has been granted by the lessors.  There
exists no default or event of default by the Company or by any other party to
the Company Leases, or occurrence, condition or act (including the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby) which, with the giving of notice, the
lapse of time or the happening of any further event or condition, would become a
default or event of default by the Company under the Company Leases, and there
are no outstanding claims of breach or indemnification or notice of default or
termination of any of the Company Leases.  The Company is in physical possession
and actual and exclusive occupation of the real property subject to the Company
Leases.  The real property leased by the Company pursuant to the Company Leases
requires no repair or restoration works in order to (i) comply with the terms of
the Company Leases or (ii) maintain the leased property in a state of good
maintenance and repair suitable for the purposes for which it is presently being
used.  The Company is currently occupying the real property subject to the
Company Leases in compliance with all laws, statutes, ordinances or other
applicable rules or regulations of any governmental or regulatory authority.
The Company does not owe any brokerage commission with respect to the real
property subject to the Company Lease</A></A></A></A>s.</LI>
<LI>Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Shareholders'
Agreement (collectively, the &quot;Transaction Documents&quot;) by the Company,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will

administrative order or treaty or any award, decision, injunction, judgment,
order, ruling, subpoena or a verdict rendered by any court, administrative
agency or other governmental body or by any arbitrator, (b) require the consent
of or any filing with any person or governmental body other than the filing of a
Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a notice of transaction

Secretary of State, (c) violate, result (with or without notice or the passage
of time, or both) in a breach of, or give rise to any right to terminate,
accelerate or cancel any obligation under, any material contract to which the
Company is subject or bound, or (d) result in the creation of any charge, claim,
lien, security interest or other encumbrance of any kind upon any property of
the Company.</LI>
<LI>There is no action, investigation, arbitration, hearing, litigation or suit
(whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or informal) pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its assets or property before any
court, governmental body or arbitrator.  Neither the Company nor any of its
assets or properties is subject to any order, judgment, injunction or
decree.</LI>
<LI>Except as set forth on Schedule 4.8, the Company has all governmental and
regulatory licenses, permits and authorizations (all of which are in full force
and effect) necessary to conduct its business as contemplated.  The Company owns
all trademarks, service marks and trade dress which it expects to use in the
business of the Company including without limitation the &quot;LA Food
Show&quot; service mark.</LI>

Company or any affiliate of any such person, and no member of such person's
immediate family, has engaged in any transactions or entered into any contract,
agreement or other arrangement with the Company.  No officer or director of the
