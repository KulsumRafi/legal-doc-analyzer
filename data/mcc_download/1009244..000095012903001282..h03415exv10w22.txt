ARTICLE 2. THE CREDIT FACILITIES.

2.1      Revolving Loans.

         2.1.1    Advances. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants of
the Borrower made herein, the Lender agrees to make loans (each, a "REVOLVING
LOAN" and collectively, the "REVOLVING LOANS") to the Borrower at the Borrower's
request from time to time, from and after the date hereof and prior to the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date, provided that the aggregate principal amount of
Revolving Loans outstanding at any time (after giving effect to all amounts
requested), plus the aggregate principal Stated Amount of Letters of Credit
outstanding at such time, plus the aggregate amount of any unreimbursed draws
under outstanding Letters of Credit at such time, shall not exceed the Revolving
Credit Maximum Amount, and provided, further, that at the time the Borrower
requests a Revolving Loan, and after giving effect to the making thereof, no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The Revolving Credit
Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower in favor of the
Lender in or substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto (the "REVOLVING
CREDIT NOTE"), with appropriate insertions. All requests for Revolving Loans
shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D and shall be made in such
manner as shall be agreed between the Borrower and the Lender, except that each
Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000 and shall be in an
integral multiple of $100,000, or, if less, the remaining unused Revolving
Credit Maximum Amount.

         2.1.2    Overadvances. The Borrower agrees that it shall be an Event of
Default hereunder if at any time the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding (after giving effect to all amounts requested), plus the aggregate
Stated Amount of Letters of

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
Credit outstanding at such time, plus the aggregate amount of any unreimbursed
draws under outstanding Letters of Credit at such time, shall exceed the
Revolving Credit Maximum Amount then in effect, unless the Borrower, upon notice
of such excess from the Lender, immediately, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day, pays cash to the Lender to be credited to the Loan Account in such
amount as shall be necessary to eliminate the excess.

         2.1.3    Increase to Revolving Loan Maximum Amount. Following the
Lender's receipt of the audited Consolidated financial statements of the
Borrower Affiliated Group for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 required
under Section 5.1(a), the Borrower may request an increase in the Revolving Loan
Commitment. The Lender may grant or deny such request in the Lender's sole
discretion. In the event that the Lender elects not to provide the Borrower with
an increase in the Revolving Loan Commitment, the Lender will attempt in good
faith to add a new lender hereunder willing to commit to such increase in the
Revolving Loan Commitment.

2.2      Term Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Lender agrees to lend to the Borrower on the Closing Date, and
the Borrower agrees to borrow on such date and repay in accordance with Section
2.3, an amount equal to the Term Loan Commitment (the "TERM LOAN"). No amounts
prepaid on the Term Loan may be reborrowed. The Term Loan shall be evidenced by
separate promissory note of the Borrower in favor of the Lender in or
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (the "TERM NOTE"), with
appropriate insertions.

2.3      Payment and Prepayment of Loans.

         2.3.1    Payment of Revolving Loans. Interest on the Revolving Loans
shall be payable as provided in Section 2.5. On the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date, all outstanding principal of the Revolving Loans, together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all fees, charges and expenses relating
thereto, shall be absolutely and unconditionally due and payable in full by the
Borrower to the Lender.

         2.3.2    Payment of Term Loan. Interest on the Term Loan shall be
payable as provided in Section 2.5. The outstanding principal of the Term Loan
shall be amortized in 20 equal installments of $250,000.00 payable on the last
day of each consecutive fiscal quarter of the Borrower commencing with the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending nearest to September 30, 2001. If not
sooner paid, on the Term Loan Maturity Date all outstanding principal of the
Term Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all fees,
charges and expenses relating thereto, shall be absolutely and unconditionally
due and payable in full by the Borrower to the Lender.

         2.3.3    Method of Payment. All payments and prepayments of principal
and all payments of interest and other amounts shall be made by the Borrower to
the Lender at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, in immediately
available funds, on or before 11:00 a.m. (Boston, Massachusetts time) on the due
date thereof, free and clear of,




                                      -12-
<PAGE>

and without any deduction or withholding for, any Taxes (excluding any taxes
imposed on the net income of the Lender) or other payments.

         2.3.4    Voluntary Prepayment. Subject to the provisions of Subsection
2.5.2(d), the Borrower may prepay outstanding Loans, or reduce the amount of any
Loan Commitment, in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty upon
five Business Days' prior written notice to the Lender, provided, however, that
prepayments of the Revolving Loan that do not involve a permanent reduction of
the Revolving Loan Commitment shall not require prior written notice. Amounts so
paid in respect of Revolving Loans (without a reduction in the Revolving Loan
Commitment) may be borrowed and re-borrowed from time to time as provided in
Subsection 2.1.1. Any prepayment of the Term Loan shall constitute a permanent
reduction of the Term Loan and may not be re-borrowed. With respect to the Term
Loan, provided that the Borrower's Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (see
Subsection 5.16(a)) is greater than 1.50 to 1.0 as of the end of the Borrower's
fiscal quarter immediately preceding such prepayment, such voluntary prepayments
of principal shall be applied to installments of principal due in inverse order
of maturity. In all other cases, prepayments will be applied pro rata to reduce
all remaining principal installments of the Term Loan. All reductions of Loan
Commitments, and all prepayments of any Loan, shall be in a minimum amount equal
to $50,000 and in additional increments of $50,000.

         2.3.5    Mandatory Prepayment. To the extent that they exceed the sum
of $500,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement, all proceeds
from (w) the sale of assets by any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, (x)
the sale of equity interests by any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group
(except to an Affiliate of the Borrower or to another member of the Borrower
Affiliated Group), (y) the issuance of any Indebtedness by any member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group (any such Indebtedness only to be issued in compliance
with Section 5.5), and (z) any insurance proceeds due to any member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group shall be paid to the Lender as permanent reductions of
the principal of the Term Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
during which an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all such
proceeds shall be so paid to the Lender as permanent reductions of the principal
of the Term Loan whether or not the aggregate amount of all such proceeds
received during the term of this Agreement exceeds $500,000. Provided that the
Borrower's Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (see Subsection 5.16(a)) is
greater than 1.50 to 1.0 as of the end of the Borrower's fiscal quarter
immediately preceding such prepayment, such mandatory prepayments of principal
shall be applied to installments of principal due in inverse order of maturity.
In all other cases, such mandatory prepayments of principal will be applied pro
rata to reduce all remaining principal installments of the Term Loan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, the Borrower shall not
be required to pay to the Lender under this Subsection 2.3.5 any proceeds
resulting from (i) the sale of the two parcels of real property identified with
reference to this Section 2.3 in Exhibit B (the "SALE PROPERTIES"), provided
that all proceeds of such sales which exceed $2,500,000 in the aggregate shall
be paid to the Lender for application to the Term Loan in the same manner as
proceeds of other asset sales, (ii) insurance settlements resulting from damage


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


or destruction to restaurant units, provided that the Borrower provides to the
Lender evidence (in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender in its sole
discretion) that such proceeds have been reinvested in the same or replacement
restaurant units within 270 days of the receipt thereof by the applicable member
of the Borrower Affiliated Group, and (iii) the issuance of equity interests in
members of the Borrower Affiliated Group as part of customary employee option
transactions or similar compensation-related transactions, provided that such
issuances are made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with prior
practice.

2.4      Lender's Records of Loan Activity.

         2.4.1    Loan Account. The Lender shall, in its discretion, enter Loans
and advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
(including, without limitation, on account of Letters of Credit) as debits in
the Loan Account. The Lender shall also record in the Loan Account all payments
made by the Borrower on account of the Loans and may also record therein, in
accordance with customary accounting practices, other debits and credits,
including customary banking charges and all interest, fees, charges and expenses
chargeable to the Borrower under this Agreement. The debit balance of the Loan
Account shall reflect the amount of the Borrower's Obligations hereunder and
shall be considered correct absent manifest error. The Borrower authorizes the
Lender to charge to the Loan Account or to any deposit account which the
Borrower may maintain with the Lender the principal, interest, fees, charges,
taxes and expenses provided for in this Agreement or any other document executed
or delivered in connection herewith.

         2.4.2    Note Schedules. The Lender may, instead of or in addition to
maintaining a Loan Account, and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower
to, enter on the schedule forming a part of its Notes or otherwise in its
records, appropriate notations (collectively, the "NOTE SCHEDULES") evidencing
the date and the amount of each Loan, as applicable, the interest rate
applicable thereto and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by
the Borrower with respect thereto; and such notations shall be considered
correct absent manifest error. The Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized by
the Borrower to attach to and make a part of its Notes a continuation of any
such schedule as and when required. No failure on the part of the Lender to make
any notation as provided in this Subsection 2.4.3 shall in any way affect any
Loan or the rights of the Lender or the Obligations of the Borrower with respect
thereto.

2.5  Interest.

         2.5.1    Prime Rate Plus Applicable Prime Rate Margin. Subject to the
provisions of Subsection 2.5.2 and Section 2.7, Revolving Loans and the Term
Loan shall each bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate in
effect from time to time, plus the Applicable Prime Rate Margin in effect at
such time. Interest on Revolving Loans and the Term Loan (not at the time
overdue) bearing interest with reference to the Prime Rate shall be payable
monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each month. Any change



                                      -14-
<PAGE>


in the Prime Rate shall result in a change on the same day in the rate of
interest to accrue from and after such day on the unpaid balance of principal of
Revolving Loans and Term Loan.

         2.5.2    LIBOR Plus Applicable LIBOR Margin.

         (a)      At the option of the Borrower, so long as no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Borrower may elect from time
to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity
Date, as applicable, to have all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of
any Loan bear interest during any particular Interest Period by reference to
LIBOR; provided, that any such portion of any Loan shall be in an amount not
less than $250,000 or some greater integral multiple of $250,000 with respect to
any single Interest Period, and provided further, that there shall not be more
than five (5) Loans (or portions thereof) outstanding at any time the interest
on which is determined by reference to LIBOR. Any election by the Borrower to
have interest calculated by reference to LIBOR shall be made by notice (which
shall be irrevocable) to Lender at least three Business Days prior to the first
day of the proposed Interest Period, specifying the LIBOR Amount and the
duration of the proposed Interest Period (which must be for one, two or three
months). Any such election of a LIBOR shall lapse at the end of the expiring
Interest Period unless extended by a further election notice as hereinbefore
provided and, in the event of such lapse, the applicable Loans shall bear
interest with reference to the Prime Rate in accordance with Section 2.5.1.
Except as otherwise provided herein, each LIBOR Amount shall bear interest
during each Interest Period relating thereto at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR
plus the Applicable LIBOR Margin then in effect. Interest on each LIBOR Amount
shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period relating thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may not select an Interest Period which
extends beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity Date for Revolving Loans or the
Term Loan Maturity Date for the Term Loan.

         (b)      The Lender shall forthwith upon determining LIBOR provide
notice thereof to the Borrower. Each such notice shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower. If, with respect to any Interest Period, the Lender is unable
to determine LIBOR relating thereto, or adverse or unusual conditions in or
changes in applicable law relating to the applicable London interbank market
make it illegal or, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender, impracticable, to
fund therein the LIBOR Amount or make the projected LIBOR unreflective of the
actual costs of funds therefor to the Lender, or if it shall become unlawful for
the Lender to charge interest on the Loans on a LIBOR basis, then in any of the
foregoing events the Lender shall so notify the Borrower and interest will be
calculated and payable in respect of such projected Interest Period (and
thereafter for so long as the conditions referred to in this sentence shall
continue) by reference to the Prime Rate in accordance with Subsection 2.5.1.

         (c)      If any Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is
not a Business Day for LIBOR purposes, that Interest Period shall end on the
Business Day next



                                      -15-
<PAGE>

preceding or next succeeding such day as determined by the Lender in accordance
with its usual practices and notified to the Borrower at the beginning of such
Interest Period.

         (d)      If for any reason any payment or prepayment of principal of a
LIBOR Amount is made on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period,
then the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for the loss, if any, computed
pursuant to the following formula:

                           L =  (R-T) x P x D
                                ------------- + RC
                                    360

                           L =  amount of loss to be reimbursed to Lender.

                           R =  LIBOR plus the Applicable LIBOR Margin at the
                                time of the payment.

                           T =  effective interest rate in which United
                                States Treasury bills maturing on the last
                                day of the then current Interest Period and
                                in the same amount as the unpaid principal
                                amount of the Loan can be purchased by
                                Lender on the day of such payment of
                                principal.

                           D =  the number of days remaining in the Interest
                                Period as of the date of such payment.

                           P =  the amount of principal paid.

                           RC = the Reserve Charge due through the date of such
                                payment.

The Borrower shall pay to the Lender the amount of loss, computed in accordance
with the foregoing formula, upon presentation by the Lender of a statement
setting forth the Lender's calculation of the amount of such loss, which notice
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower in the absence of manifest
error.

2.6      Applicable Interest Rate Margins. The "APPLICABLE PRIME RATE MARGIN"
and the "APPLICABLE LIBOR MARGIN" shall, at any given point in time, be
determined in accordance with Table 1 below; provided, however, that from the
Closing Date through the date upon which the Lender first receives the
Consolidated balance sheet and statement of income, retained earnings and cash
flow of the Borrower Affiliated Group for the fiscal quarter ending nearest to
September 30, 2001, together with the CFO Report relating thereto, the level
used to determine the Applicable Prime Rate Margin and the Applicable LIBOR
Margin shall be Level IV.

</TABLE>

         For purposes of determining the Applicable Prime Rate Margin and the
Applicable LIBOR Margin, the Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Minimum
Trailing Four Quarters EBITDA will be tested quarterly, commencing with the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending nearest to September 30, 2001, based on
the annual or quarterly financial statements required to be delivered pursuant
to Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(b), respectively. For purposes of determining the
interest rate for any Interest Rate Period hereunder, any interest rate change
shall be effective three Business Days after the date on which the financial
statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b)
are delivered to the Lender, together with the applicable CFO Report and a
notice to the Lender specifying any change in the Applicable Prime Rate Margin
and the Applicable LIBOR Margin. If the Borrower has failed to deliver the
financial statements required to be delivered by it pursuant to Section 5.1(a)
or Section 5.1(b), the Applicable Prime Rate Margin and the Applicable LIBOR
Margin that are then in effect shall automatically be increased to Level IV
until such financial statements are delivered.

2.7      Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
at the option of the Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
unpaid balance of all Loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to (i) in the
case of a non-monetary Event of Default, a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%
and (ii) in the case of a monetary Event of Default, a rate equal to the Prime
Rate plus 3%, in either case compounded monthly until such Event of Default is
cured or waived.

2.8      Letters of Credit. Issuance. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in reliance upon the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Borrower made herein, the Lender agrees to issue
upon the application of the Borrower, to the extent permitted by law and the
Uniform Customs and Practice of the International Chamber of Commerce governing
Letters of Credit (Publication No. 500 or any successor thereto), Letters of
Credit during the period from the date hereof to the 30th day prior to




                                      -17-


<PAGE>


the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided that (i) the aggregate Stated
Amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any time, plus the aggregate amount
of all unreimbursed draws under such outstanding Letters of Credit shall not at
any time exceed $2,000,000, and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving
Loans outstanding at such time plus the aggregate principal amount of all
Letters of Credit outstanding at such time, plus the aggregate principal amount
of all unreimbursed draws under outstanding Letters of Credit, shall not exceed
the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount at any time; and provided, further, that at
the time Borrower requests the issuance of a Letter of Credit, and after giving
effect to the issuance thereof, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred or be continuing. All Letters of Credit shall have a stated expiration
date not to exceed one (1) year and shall, in any event, expire not later than
the 15th day prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Amounts drawn under
the Letters of Credit shall become immediately due and payable by the Borrower
to the Lender and, if there is availability under the Revolving Credit Maximum
Amount and no Default or Event of Default exists or would be caused thereby,
upon the request of the Borrower, the Lender shall add the amounts drawn to the
Loan Account as Revolving Loans. In order to evidence such Letters of Credit,
the Borrower shall enter into with the Lender such agreements and execute such
instruments and documents as the Lender customarily requires in like
transactions.

2.9       Changed Circumstances.

         2.9.1    Changed Capital Requirements. If, after the date hereof, the
Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any applicable law, rule,
regulation, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of
law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Lender with any
of the foregoing imposes or increases a requirement by the Lender to allocate
capital resources to the Lender's commitment to make Loans which has or would
have the effect of reducing the return on the Lender's capital to a level below
that which the Lender could have achieved (taking into consideration the
Lender's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming
full utilization of the Lender's capital) but for such adoption, change or
compliance by any amount deemed by the Lender to be material, then: (i) the
Lender shall promptly after its determination of such occurrence give notice
thereof to the Borrower; and (ii) to the extent that the costs of such increased
capital requirements are not reflected in the then interest rate applicable to
the Loans, the Borrower and the Lender shall thereafter attempt to negotiate in
good faith, within 30 days following the date the Borrower receives such notice,
an adjustment payable hereunder that will adequately compensate the Lender in
light of the circumstances. If the Lender and the Borrower are unable to agree
to such adjustment within 30 days following the date upon which the Borrower
receives such notice, then commencing on the date of such notice (but no earlier
than the effective date of any such increased capital requirement), the fees
payable hereunder shall increase by an amount that will, in the Lender's
reasonable determination, provide adequate compensation. The


                                      -18-
<PAGE>


provisions of this Section 2.9.1 shall be applied to the Borrower so as not to
discriminate against Borrower vis-a-vis other similarly situated customers of
the Lender.

         2.9.2    Other Changes Adverse to Lender. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary stated herein, if any present or future applicable law (which
expression, as used in this Agreement, includes statutes and rules and
regulations thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by
any governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time heretofore or
hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to the Lender by any central bank or
other fiscal, monetary or other authority, whether or not having the force of
law) shall (i) subject the Lender to any tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, fee,
deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this Agreement, the
maximum amount of the Loans or the payment to the Lender of any amounts due to
it hereunder, or (ii) materially change the basis of taxation of payments to the
Lender of the principal or the interest on or any other amounts payable to the
Lender hereunder, or (iii) impose or increase or render applicable any special
or supplemental special deposit or reserve or similar requirements or assessment
against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or any liabilities
of, or loans by an office of the Lender in respect of the transactions
contemplated herein, or (iv) impose on the Lender any other conditions or
requirements with respect to this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Maximum
Amount, any Revolving Loan, the Term Loan Maximum Amount or the Term Loan and
the result of any of the foregoing is (A) to increase the cost to the Lender of
making, funding or maintaining all or any part of the Loans, or (B) to reduce
the amount of principal, interest or other amount payable to the Lender
hereunder, or (C) to require the Lender to make any payment or to forego any
interest or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or
foregoing interest or other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount
of any sum receivable or deemed received by the Lender from the Borrower
hereunder, then, and in each such case not otherwise provided for hereunder, the
Borrower will, upon demand made by the Lender accompanied by calculations
thereof in reasonable detail, pay to the Lender such additional amounts as will
be sufficient to compensate the Lender for such additional cost, reduction,
payment or foregoing interest or other sum, provided that the foregoing
provisions of this sentence shall not apply in the case of any additional cost,
reduction, payment or foregoing interest or other sum resulting from any taxes
charged upon or by reference to the overall net income, profits or gains of the
Lender.

2.10     Fees and Charges.

         2.10.1   Unused Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender a
commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
fiscal quarter (or portion thereof) of the Borrower, equal to one-half of one
percent (0.50%) per annum of the Average Unused Commitment during such quarter.
In addition, for any quarterly period during which the Averaged Unused
Commitment exceeds 75% of the total available facility, a surcharge equal to an
additional one-quarter of one percent


                                      -19-

Borrower to the Lender.

         2.10.2   Reserve Charge. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender the

from time to time on the dates interest is payable on such LIBOR Amounts.

         2.10.3   Letter of Credit Fee. A Letter of Credit fee shall be payable
quarterly on each outstanding standby Letter of Credit at a rate per annum equal
to the Applicable LIBOR Margin applicable to Revolving Loans then in effect
multiplied by the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, along with such
issuance, documentary processing and other fees as are customarily charged by
Lender on standby letters of credit. In the event that additional lenders are
added to the credit facility, the Borrower shall, in addition to and not in lieu
of any other fees payable hereunder, pay to the Lender, as the issuing bank, a
fronting fee equal to one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) multiplied by the
Stated Amount of each standby Letter of Credit. Fees assessed under this
Subsection 2.10.3 shall be payable by the Borrower on the last Business Day of
each fiscal quarter of the Borrower during which any Letter of Credit is
outstanding.

         2.10.4   Closing Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender a closing

         2.10.5   Agent's Fee. From and after the date, if any, on which an
additional lender is first added to the credit facilities made available
hereunder, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, for the Lender's account in its
capacity as agent hereunder, an Agent's Fee of $7,500 per annum for each
additional lender. The Agent's Fee shall be payable quarterly in advance on the
last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower.

         2.10.6   Other Customary Charges. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender
any and all reasonable charges customarily made by the Lender against borrowers
generally.

ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. In order to induce Lender to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, and
make the Loans hereunder and issue the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby
represents, warrants and covenants to the Lender as follows:

3.1      Organization and Qualification. The Borrower and each other member of
the Borrower Affiliated Group (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation as indicated on Exhibit B hereto; (ii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own its property and conduct its business as now
conducted and as presently contemplated; and (iii) is duly qualified and in good
standing in the jurisdictions indicated on Exhibit B hereto and


                                      -20-


<PAGE>


each other jurisdiction where the nature of its properties or its business
(present or proposed) requires such qualification, except where the failure to
so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the assets, liabilities, properties, income, financial condition, business or
prospects of the Borrower Affiliated Group taken as a whole. Since the date of
the Initial Financial Statement, the Borrower and each other member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group has continued to engage in substantially the same
business as that in which it was then engaged and is engaged in no unrelated
business.

3.2      Corporate Authority; Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents and the transactions and other documents
contemplated hereby and thereby are within the corporate power and authority of
the Borrower and each other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, and have
been authorized by all necessary corporate proceedings. Said execution, delivery
and performance do not and will not (a) contravene any provision of the
organizational or charter documents or by-laws of the Borrower or any other
member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, or any law, rule or regulation
applicable to the Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group,
or (b) contravene any provisions of or a default or event of default under any
other agreement, instrument, judgment, order, decree, permit, license or
undertaking binding upon or applicable to the Borrower or such other member of
the Borrower Affiliated Group (except to the extent that a waiver, consent or
approval has been obtained and remains in effect with respect to such terms and
provisions and has been delivered to the Lender), or constitute a Default or
Event of Default hereunder or (c) result in the creation, other than in favor of
the Lender, of any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien, encumbrance or
charge upon any of the properties or assets of the Borrower or any other member
of the Borrower Affiliated Group. The only material contracts of any member of
the Borrower Affiliated Group are the Leases and contracts evidencing sale
leaseback transactions, and the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan
Documents do not require any consent under or contravene any provision of any of
such Leases or contracts.

3.3      Valid Obligations; Approvals and Consents. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered to the Lender by the Borrower. Each of the Loan Documents
to which the Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group is or
is to become a party, when executed and delivered by the Borrower or such other
member of the Borrower Affiliated Group shall constitute a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower and such other members of the Borrower
Affiliated Group enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws of general application relating to enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, and (ii) general principles of equity, whether applied in a
proceeding in equity or at law. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents and other documents contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Loan Documents and such
other documents, do not require any approval or consent of, or filing or
registration with, any person or entity except the recordation of the Fee
Mortgages, and filings under the


                                      -21-


<PAGE>

Uniform Commercial Code and with the Patent and Trademark Office, in connection
with the Collateral.

3.4      Title to Properties; Absence of Liens. The Borrower and each other
member of the Borrower Affiliated Group has good and marketable title to all of
its properties, assets and rights of every name and nature now purported to be
owned by it, which properties, assets and rights include all those necessary to
permit the Borrower and each other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group to
conduct its business as such business was conducted on the date of the Initial
Financial Statement, free from all liens, charges and encumbrances whatsoever
except for insubstantial and immaterial defects in title in connection with any
owned Real Property and except for liens, charges or encumbrances permitted
under Section 5.6.

3.5      Compliance. The Borrower and each other member of the Borrower
Affiliated Group (i) has all necessary permits, approvals, authorizations,
consents, licenses, franchises, registrations and other rights and privileges
(including without limitation patents, trademarks, trade names and copyrights)
to allow it to own its properties material to its business and operate its
business without any material violation of law or the rights of others, (ii) is
duly authorized, qualified and licensed under and in compliance with all
applicable laws, regulations, authorizations and orders of public authorities
which are material to its business (including, without limitation, such laws
relating to hazardous materials, hazardous waste, oil, and protection of the
environment and laws relating to ERISA or to employee benefit plans generally),
and (iii) has performed all obligations required to be performed by it under,
and is not in default under or in violation of, its charter or by-laws, or any
material agreement, lease, mortgage, note, bond, indenture, license or other
instrument or undertaking to which it is a party or by which any of it or any of
its properties are bound. Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group has received any notice by any governmental authority
or third party with respect to the generation, storage, or disposal or release
or threat of release of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, or oil, or
with respect to any violation of any federal, state or local environmental,
health or safety statute or regulation.

3.6      Financial Statements. The Borrower has furnished to the Lender the
Consolidated and Consolidating balance sheet of the Borrower Affiliated Group as
of December 31, 2000 and the related Consolidated and Consolidating statements
of earnings and retained earnings and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended
(the "Annual Financials"), which were prepared in accordance with GAAP, and
audited and certified by KPMG, LLP and such financial statements fairly present
the Consolidated and Consolidating financial position of the Borrower Affiliated
Group as at the close of business on such date and the results of its operations
for the fiscal year then ended. The Borrower has also furnished to the Lender
the Consolidated and Consolidating unaudited balance sheet and statement of
income for the Borrower Affiliated Group as at March 31, 2000 and for the fiscal
quarter then ended (together with the Annual Financials, the "INITIAL FINANCIAL
STATEMENT"), which was prepared in accordance with GAAP and certified by the
chief financial officer of the Borrower and such financial statements fairly
present the financial position of the


                                      -22-


<PAGE>

Borrower Affiliated Group as at the close of business on such date and the
results of its operations for the fiscal quarter then ended, subject only to
normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which will be materially adverse. The
Borrower has also furnished to the Lender the most recent management letter
provided to the Borrower by its accountants. In addition, the Borrower has
furnished to the Lender pro forma projections for the Borrower Affiliated Group
for each calendar year ending December, 2001 through and including December,
2005, all prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the
financial statements required by Section 5.1. Such projections were made in good
faith and based on assumptions which the Borrower and each member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group believes were reasonable when made. On the date
hereof, neither the Borrower nor any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group has
any Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than trade indebtedness incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices), whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to become due,
that are not set forth on Exhibit B hereto. Since the date of the Initial
Financial Statement, there have been no material adverse changes, individually
or in the aggregate, in the assets, liabilities, properties, income, financial
condition, business or prospects of any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group,
except as set forth on Exhibit B hereto.

3.7      Events of Default; Solvency. As of the date of this Agreement, no
Default or Event of Default exists and neither the Borrower nor any other member
of the Borrower Affiliated Group is, or immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the Loans will be, Insolvent.

3.8      Taxes. The Borrower and each other member of the Borrower Affiliated
Group has filed all federal, state and other tax returns required to be filed
for all Taxes, and has paid (or has established adequate reserves in accordance
with GAAP for the payment of) all Taxes, assessments and other such governmental
charges due from Borrower or such other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group.
Neither Borrower nor any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group has
executed any waiver that would have the effect of extending the applicable
statute of limitations in respect of any Tax.

3.9      Labor Relations; Litigation. Neither Borrower nor any other member of
the Borrower Affiliated Group is engaged in any unfair labor practice and,
except as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto, there is no litigation,
proceeding, governmental investigation (administrative or judicial) or labor
dispute, pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower and each other member of
the Borrower Affiliated Group, threatened against Borrower or any other member
of the Borrower Group, which, if adversely determined, could have a material
adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, properties, income, financial
condition, business or prospects of the Borrower Affiliated Group taken as a
whole, or on the ability of the Borrower Affiliated Group taken as a whole to
perform its obligations under the Security Documents or under any other
agreement or document contemplated hereby or thereby, nor is any substantial
basis for any such litigation or labor dispute known to exist.

Affiliated Group.

Agreement, any other Loan Document or in any other agreement, instrument,

behalf of the Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group to
the Lender in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by any of the

hereby waived by the Borrower, (ii) limit, suspend or terminate the Borrower's
right to borrow hereunder, and (iii) exercise any rights and remedies under the

ARTICLE 7. SET OFF; PARTICIPATIONS.

7.1.     Right of Set Off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred, and while
it is continuing, any deposits or other sums at any time credited by or due from
the Lender or any entity under the control of Fleet Financial Group, Inc. to the
Borrower may, without demand or notice (any such demand or notice being
expressly waived hereby) and to the fullest extent permitted by law and without
regard to any source of payment whatsoever, at any time be applied to or set off
against Obligations on which the Borrower is primarily liable and may at or
after the maturity thereof be applied to or set off against Obligations on which
the Borrower is secondarily liable, and advice thereof shall thereafter be given
to the Borrower's chief financial officer.

7.2      Rights of Participants. For so long as any Obligation remains

referred to in this subsection as a "PARTICIPANT") the right to rely upon all of
the representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other agreements, instruments and documents
referred to herein or contemplated hereby in making such investment or
participation. The Borrower agrees the decision of any Participant to invest or
participate in the Loans shall constitute an acceptance of such offer and shall
make the Participant a creditor of the Borrower and each other member of the
Borrower Affiliated Group. Any Participant may exercise the rights of set-off
granted to the Lender in this Article 7 with respect to any outstanding
indebtedness of the Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated

practice.

MAKING OF THE LOANS, THE SUPERVISION, PROTECTION AND COLLECTION OF AND
REALIZATION UPON ANY COLLATERAL, AND THE PROTECTION OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE
LENDER'S RIGHTS HEREUNDER AND UNDER THE OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

         8.4.2    THE BORROWER SHALL ABSOLUTELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY INDEMNIFY
AND HOLD THE LENDER HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, SUITS,
ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DAMAGES, LOSSES, SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS, OBLIGATIONS,
COSTS, EXPENSES AND ALL OTHER LIABILITIES WHATSOEVER WHICH SHALL AT ANY TIME OR
TIMES BE INCURRED OR SUSTAINED BY THE LENDER OR BY ANY OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR AGENTS (EXCEPT ANY
OF THE FOREGOING INCURRED OR SUSTAINED AS A RESULT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE LENDER) ON ACCOUNT OF, OR IN RELATION TO, OR IN ANY
WAY IN CONNECTION WITH, ASSOCIATED WITH OR ANCILLARY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SECURITY DOCUMENTS AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, AND THE ARRANGEMENTS OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN, WHETHER OR
NOT ALL OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY, ASSOCIATED WITH OR ANCILLARY
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF SUCH DOCUMENTS ARE ULTIMATELY CONSUMMATED. WITHOUT
PREJUDICE TO THE SURVIVAL OF ANY OTHER COVENANT OF THE BORROWER HEREUNDER, THE
COVENANTS OF THIS SUBSECTION 8.4.2 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE PAYMENT OR SATISFACTION OF PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OWING WITH
RESPECT TO THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENT.

8.5      Amendments, Waivers, Etc. This Agreement, the Notes and the Security
Documents, and any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, discharged or
terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the Lender and may be
amended only by an instrument in writing signed by both the Borrower and the
Lender.

8.6      Binding Effect of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lender and their respective
successors and assigns. The Lender shall have the unrestricted right at any time
or from time to time, and without the Borrower's consent, to assign (or
participate) all or any portion of its rights and


                                      -41-


<PAGE>


obligations hereunder to one or more banks or other financial institutions
(each, an "ASSIGNEE"), and the Borrower agrees that it shall execute, or cause
to be executed, such documents, including without limitation, amendments to this
Agreement and to any other documents, instruments and agreements executed in
connection herewith as the Lender shall deem necessary to effect the foregoing,
provided that (i) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Lender will make any such assignment or participation in a
minimum amount of $1,000,000 and will get the Borrower's consent thereto, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being agreed that no such
consent shall be required in connection with a pledge of all or any portion of
its rights under the Loan Documents to any of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks
organized under ss.4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341, no such
pledge or the enforcement thereof to release the Lender from its obligations
under any of the Loan Documents), and (ii) with respect to any such
participation, the Borrower shall be permitted to make payments to and otherwise
deal solely with the Lender (it being acknowledged that the participant may have
certain voting rights pursuant to the particular participation arrangement). In
addition, at the request of the Lender and any such Assignee, the Borrower shall
issue one or more new promissory notes, as applicable, to any such Assignee and,
if the Lender has retained any of its rights and obligations hereunder following
such assignment, to the Lender, which new promissory notices shall be issued in
replacement of, but not in discharge of, the liability evidenced by the
promissory note held by the Lender prior to such assignment and shall reflect
the amount of the respective commitments and loans held by such Assignee and the
Lender after giving effect to such assignment. Upon the execution and delivery
of appropriate assignment documentation, amendments and any other documentation
required by the Lender in connection with such assignment, and the payment by
the Assignee of the purchase price agreed to by the Lender and such Assignee,
such Assignee shall be a party to this Agreement and shall have all of the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder (and under any and all other
documents, instruments and agreements executed in connection herewith) to the
extent that such rights and obligations have been assigned by the Lender
pursuant to the assignment documentation between the Lender and such Assignee,
and the Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder and thereunder
to a corresponding extent. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Lender may
at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights under the Security Documents
including any portion of either Note to any of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks
organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341. No
such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release the Lender from its obligations
under any of the Security Documents. The Borrower may not assign or transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder.

8.7      Computation of Interest and Fees, Etc. Interest, fees and charges shall
be computed daily on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual
number of days for which due. If the due date for any payment of principal is
extended by operation of law, interest shall be payable for such extended time.
If any payment required by this Agreement becomes due on a day on which banks in
Boston, Massachusetts are required or permitted by law or an appropriate
authority to remain closed, such payment may be made on the next succeeding day
on which such banks are open, and such extension shall be included


                                      -42-


<PAGE>


in computing interest in connection with such payment. All payments required of
the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America in federal or other funds immediately available to the
recipient thereof at the prescribed place of payment.

8.8      Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, sets
forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of
the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements,
promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations, warranties,
whether oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative of any party
hereto.

8.9      Headings. The headings for the sections of this Agreement are for ease
of reference only and are not an integral part of this Agreement. Accordingly,
such headings shall have no relevance to the interpretation of this Agreement.

8.10     Multiple Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures hereto and thereto were
upon the same instrument. All such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same agreement.

8.11     Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if
any of these provisions shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to
be unenforceable, such holdings shall not affect or impair any other provision
hereof.

8.12     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO. THIS WAIVER
CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR LENDER TO EXECUTE THIS AGREEMENT AND MAKE
THE LOANS.

8.13.    WAIVER OF SPECIAL DAMAGES. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE BORROWER
HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS WHICH IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY LITIGATION
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION
WITH THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NOTE AND THE OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENTS AND ANY AMENDMENTS THEREOF, ANY SPECIAL
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE BORROWER (A) CERTIFIES THAT NEITHER THE
LENDER NOR ANY REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY THEREOF HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE LENDER WOULD


                                      -43-

<PAGE>

NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LENDER IS RELYING UPON,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION
8.13.

8.14.    Usury. All agreements between the Borrower and the Lender are hereby
expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by
reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use
or the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum
permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term "applicable law"
shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof provided, however, that in
the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible
rate of interest then the Revolving Credit Note and the Term Note shall be
governed by such new law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is
expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Borrower and the Lender in the
execution, delivery and acceptance of the Revolving Credit Note and the Term
Note to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the Loan Documents
at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve
transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law, then the
obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such
validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Lender should ever
receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such
amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of
the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. This
provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between the
Borrower and the Lender.

8.15     Replacement of Notes and Other Loan Documents. Upon receipt of an
affidavit of an officer of the Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of the Revolving Credit Note, the Term Note, or any other Security
Document which is not of public record, and, in the case of any such loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such Revolving Credit
Note, Term Note or other Security Document, and execution and delivery of an
appropriate indemnification agreement by the Bank in favor of the Borrower
relating thereto, the Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement
Revolving Credit Not, Term Note or other Security Document in the same principal
amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.
