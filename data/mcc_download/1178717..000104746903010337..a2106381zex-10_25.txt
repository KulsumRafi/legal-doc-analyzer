Period, compliance by Holdings with Section 9.09 of the Credit Agreement at all

II.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

          1.     In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Waiver, each
Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and warrants that:

          (a)    no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Waiver
     Effective Date (as defined below), both immediately before and immediately

          (b)    all of the representations and warranties contained in the
     Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all
     material respects on the Waiver Effective Date both immediately before and
     immediately after giving effect to this Waiver, with the same effect as
     though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the
     Waiver Effective Date (it being understood that any representation or
     warranty made as of a specific date shall be true and correct in all
     material respects as of such specific date).

          2.     This Waiver is limited as specified and shall not constitute a

          5.     This Waiver shall become effective on the date (the "Waiver
Effective Date") when each Credit Agreement Party, the Administrative Agent and

hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered
(including by way of facsimile transmission) the same to the Administrative
Agent at its Notice Office.

          6.     From and after the Waiver Effective Date, all references in the
