              BACKHOE TRENCH EXPOSES SILICIFIED BRECCIAS AT CERRO T

Radius  Explorations Ltd. and Pillar Resources Inc. are pleased to report  assay
results  from  a drill access road-cut recently excavated on the Cerro  T  Zone,
located within the Marimba Property in eastern Guatemala.

Pillar  is  earning  into  a 60% interest in the Marimba  Property  from  Radius
Explorations  through direct property expenditures (see release  2002-10,  Sept.
24) and is advancing the project aggressively.

The  road-cut, excavated along the north-face of the Cerro T hillside at the 520
metre  contour  level, exposes a silicified breccia for 75 metres  along  strike
(from 0 to 75 metres), north of and below the area of previous sampling.  Thirty
five  metres  of colluvium containing abundant silicified breccia  float  occurs
from  75m  to  110m.   The last 10 metres of the road-cut exposed  a  travertine
blanket, which is interpreted to cover a significant part of the north face of
the hillside.

Sampling along the road was continuous through the area of confirmed outcrop.  A
variety  of  sampling orientations were applied, including diagonal,  horizontal
and  panel  samples, taking into account observed structural patterns.   Through
the  area where colluvium is mapped, sampling was semi-continuous with a 5m chip
sample taken every 10m.  At the travertine, a +2m deep pit was excavated without
reaching bedrock.  Two vertical 1m chip samples of the travertine were taken  in
the  pit.  Results are listed below on a sample by sample basis  from  east  to
west.

Highly  anomalous soil geochemistry across the entire north face of the hill  at
Cerro  T indicates that the silicified breccias exposed in the road-cut continue
east  across  the  hillside under the travertine blanket, a  distance  of  1,200
metres.

The  true  thickness of the gold zone in the area of the road-cut is unknown  at
the  present time but the exposure indicates a minimum thickness of  15  metres.
Additional trenching across the strike of the zone at the western limit  of  the
soil  anomaly  will commence shortly.  Drill testing of Cerro T and  other  gold
zones within the Marimba Property is scheduled for late November.
