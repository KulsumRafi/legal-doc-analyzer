     (c) Payment of Penalty Amounts.

          (i)  Manager will pay each applicable penalty amount on or before (i)
               the date five business days after the last A Market achieves Full
               Buildout Coverage and (ii) each date five business days after
               each B Market achieves Full Buildout Coverage (each a "Payment
               Date").

          (ii) Manager will also owe Additional Interest on the individual
               penalty amounts, which Additional Interest is payable in the same
               manner as the penalty amounts (e.g., timing and form of payment).

          (iii) Manager will pay the aggregate penalty amounts in cash or in
               Manager Shares, at Sprint PCS's election. Payments of cash will
               be made via wire transfer in accordance with instructions
               provided to Manager by Sprint PCs.

     (d) Waiver of Cure Rights.

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

          (i)  If Manager does not achieve Full Buildout Coverage in a market by
               11:59 p.m. (Kansas City time) on the 90-Day Threshold, Manager
               will be in breach of a material term of the Management Agreement.
               Accordingly, in such event Sprint PCS may declare an Event of
               Termination under the Management Agreement, and Manager waives
               any right to a cure period set forth in Section 11.3.3.

          (ii) If Sprint PCS does not declare in writing an Event of Termination
               within ten business days after the 90-Day Threshold, Sprint PCS
               waives its right to declare an Event of Termination based on
               Manager's failure to meet a Full Buildout Date until the 180-Day
               Threshold. If Manager does not achieve Full Buildout Coverage in
               a market by 11:59 p.m. (Kansas City time) on the 180-Day
               Threshold, Manager will be in breach of a material term of the
               Management Agreement. Accordingly, in such event Sprint PCS may
               declare an Event of Termination under the Management Agreement,
               and Manager waives any right to a cure period set forth in
               Section 11.3.3.

     the Sprint PCS Network and (ii) to connect the Service Area Network with
     the national platforms used by Sprint PCS to provide services to Manager
     under the agreement and/or the Services Agreement. Pricing for such long
     distance telephony services will be as set forth in Exhibit 2.1.1 to the

     respect to fees paid for billing-related services, the monthly charge for
     any fees based on the number of subscribers will be based on the number of
     gross activations in the month for which the charge is being calculated
     plus the number of subscribers of the Service Area Network on the last day
     of the prior calendar month.

     11. Expedite Fees. If Sprint PCS and Manager agree to pay additional fees
to a third party for any efforts associated with expediting completion of any
portion of Manager's Build Out Plan or Switch Integration to meet a Network
Ready Date (the "NRD") including, but not limited to, payment of expedited fees
for microwave relocation, and the NRD is later extended due to Manager action or
lack of action, then Manager will have full responsibility for the payment of
such fees.

     12. Deletion of Sections. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 of Addendum I to the
Management Agreement are hereby deleted in their entirety.

obtain loans (the "Loans") from RTFC and its successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Lenders"). Manager agrees that notwithstanding the permitted
uses of the proceeds of the Loans, it will not use the proceeds from any loan or
other obligation to which the RTFC Consent and Agreement relates or from any
other loan or extension of credit to which the RTFC Consent and Agreement
relates for any purpose other than to construct and operate the Service Area
Network within the Service Area (as may be amended from time to time) as
contemplated under the Management Agreement.

     14. Consent and Agreement Not Assignable. Except as expressly required or
permitted in the RTFC Consent and Agreement, Manager may not assign the RTFC
Consent and Agreement.

     15. Notices. Manager agrees to promptly give Sprint PCS a copy of any
notice Manager receives from the Administrative Agent or any Lender (as those
terms are defined in the RTFC Consent and Agreement) and a copy of any notice

promptly give Manager a copy of any notice that Sprint PCS gives to any of such
persons.

     16. Counterparts. This Addendum may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when
