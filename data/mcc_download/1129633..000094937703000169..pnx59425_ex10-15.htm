          -    Option value will be based on a formula that incorporates changes in operating income (adjusted
               for change in amortization of goodwill and intangibles during the plan period) and revenue.
               Weighting for valuation purposes will be 2/3 operating income before increased amortization
               of goodwill and other intangibles and 1/3 revenue.

          -    33 1/3% on the first three anniversaries of each grant.

          -    5 years from date of grant.

<B>Valuation</B>
          -    Phantom Option valuations will be calculated periodically.

<B>Exercise</B>
          -    Vested Phantom Options may be exercised and cashed out at any time, based on the most recent
               valuation.
