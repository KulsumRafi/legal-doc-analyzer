Employee with an invoice, not later than ten (10) days prior to the applicable
payment date, detailing the amount to be paid to the Company in respect of Loan
Taxes on or prior to such payment date; provided, that the failure of the

responsibility to pay the Loan Taxes arising from the forgiveness of the Loan
described in this Section 2(c).&#160; The Employee
further agrees that, in the event he fails to timely pay any amounts to the
Company required in respect of Loan Taxes as provided above, the Company shall

applicable law or in equity) to set off against amounts (if any) payable by the
