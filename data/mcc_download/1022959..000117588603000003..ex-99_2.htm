<p><font size="2">Gentlemen:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">I hereby resign as a director of
VoiceFlash Networks, Inc. (the
&quot;Company&quot;), effective immediately. I
have resigned because, as you know, I have serious
disagreements with management regarding
operations, policies and reporting. Specifically,
I advised the SEC and the Board that it had
recently come to my attention that the Company's
financial statements for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2002, which were included in the
Company's Form 10-KSB and certified by members of
management under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may be
materially false and misleading in that the
Company may have improperly recognized significant
income revenue in that fiscal year. The
misstatement appears to be the result of
improperly recognizing certain
&quot;reserves&quot; established by agreements
between the Company's subsidiary and its
customers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Since I disclosed these
allegations to the SEC and the Board, I have been
harassed, terminated as Chairman and hounded by
management and their lawyers, Hunton and Williams.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">At a Board meeting held on
December 9, 2002, I made a resolution for an
independent investigation of this matter. That was
voted down. I also made a resolution calling for
an annual shareholders meeting to be scheduled on
a specific date; the Board voted that down as
well, Thereafter, my only alternative was to go to
court to compel that a meeting be held.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Board has removed me as
Chairman of the Board of VoiceFlash Networks and
as Chairman of the Board of United Capturdyne, the
Company's operating subsidiary. I believe these
actions violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that
protects whistleblowers. Moreover, the Company's
attorneys, Hunton and Williams, have refused to
step aside to allow an independent investigation
Hunton and Williams were the lawyers who assisted
in preparation of the Form 10-KSB and are now
conducting the investigation into these
allegations. This is like Enron where the lawyers
investigated their own acts and the acts and the
acts of their clients and principals. I believe
that Hunton and WIlliams have become an impediment
in a true investigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">At the December 9, 2002 Board
meeting, the Board also approved a resolution to
negotiate with Berthel Fisher, an NASD broker
dealer (Berthel holds a promissory note from the
Company convertible into about 300,000 shares of
the Company's stock). I now suspect that
management is negotiating to issue millions of
shares to Berthel Fisher to dilute the outstanding
shares held by current shareholders. I also
believe that the Audit Committee is not
independent, and has signed off without a true
examination of the company's filings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Based upon the foregoing
disagreements with management, I hereby resign as
a Director. I hereby request that the Company
disclose these disagreements to the public and to
the shareholders in accordance with federal
securities laws.</font></p>
