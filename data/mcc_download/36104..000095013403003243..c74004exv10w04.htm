</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">The 1991 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;1991 Plan&#148;) adopted by Star Banc
Corporation, a predecessor company to U.S. Bancorp, was amended in 1998 so that
the terms and conditions of that plan exactly match the terms and conditions of
the U.S. Bancorp 1998 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;1998 Plan&#148;), with
the exception that the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1991
Plan and the termination date of the plan (January&nbsp;7, 2001) remained unchanged.
The 1998 Plan is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.3 to U.S. Bancorp&#146;s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, options to
purchase 6,344,857 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock remained outstanding
under the 1991 Plan. No additional awards may be granted under the 1991 Plan.
