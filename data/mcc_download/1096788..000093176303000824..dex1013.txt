terminated (to the extent such waiver, discharge or termination affects the

Non-Affiliated Holders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding Investor
Stock held by all Non-Affiliated Holders on an as-converted basis, and any such
amendment, waiver, discharge or termination, whether retroactively or
prospectively effective, shall be binding on all of the Investors, Management
Holders and Additional Stockholders."

the following:

          "3.02 Co-Sale Rights. To the extent that an Offer Notice has been
delivered as set forth in Section 3.01 above and at the end of the Election
Period, the Other Significant Stockholders have delivered Acceptance Notices as
to less than the total number of Offered Shares, to the extent the Transferring
Stockholders receive an offer or offers (with terms in compliance with the
second to last sentence of Section 3.01) to purchase a remaining number of
Offered Shares that constitute in the aggregate at least 20% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted, as-converted as-exercised basis, the
Transferring Stockholders shall deliver to each Other Significant Stockholder
who has not exercised its rights pursuant to Section 3.01 and to each
Non-Affiliated Holder (collectively, such Other Significant Stockholders and
Non-Affiliated Holders are referred to as the "Co-Sale Offerees"), written
notice of such offer (a "Sale Notice") which shall specify all of the
particulars of the offer including, but not limited to, (i) the name and address
of the proposed transferee(s); (ii) the number of shares and class of capital
stock to be transferred; (iii) a description of all the terms of the Transfer
(which must include the per share purchase price); (iv) the name of the
representative of the Transferring Stockholders and the address of such
representative to which notice of election to participate in the offer is to be
sent. Each Co-Sale Offeree may elect to participate in the offer described in
the Sale Notice at the same price per share and on the same terms by delivering
written notice of its election to participate in the offer to the representative
of the Transferring Stockholders within 15 days after receipt of the Sale
Notice; provided, however, that if the consideration to be received in the
proposed Transfer consists of securities, either in whole or in part, only
Non-Affiliated Holders that are accredited investors, as defined in Rule 501(a)
under the Securities Act, shall have the right to participate in such Transfer.
If any eligible Co-Sale Offerees have elected to participate in the offer, each
Transferring Stockholder and such Co-Sale Offerees shall be entitled to sell
pursuant to the contemplated offer, at the same price and on the same terms, a
number of shares of Significant Stockholder Stock equal to the product of (i)
the quotient determined by dividing the number of shares of Significant
Stockholder Stock, calculated on a fully diluted, as-converted, as-exercised
basis, owned by such Significant Stockholder or Non-Affiliated Holder, as the
case may be, by the aggregate number of shares of Significant Stockholder Stock,
calculated on a fully diluted, as-converted basis, as-exercised basis owned by
the Transferring Stockholder and all Co-Sale Offerees participating in such sale
and (ii) the number of shares of Significant Stockholder Stock, calculated on a
fully diluted, as-converted basis, as-exercised basis to be sold in the
contemplated Transfer. Each Transferring Stockholder shall use best efforts to
obtain the agreement of the prospective transferee(s) to the participation of
the Co-Sale Offerees in any contemplated Transfer, and no Transferring
Stockholder shall transfer any of its shares of Significant Stockholder Stock to
any prospective transferee if such prospective transferee(s) declines to allow
the participation of the Co-Sale Offerees. In addition to the requirements of
Section 6.05(b) of this Agreement, Section 3.02 shall not be waived, discharged,
terminated or amended (i) so as to increase the percentage of Offered Shares
required to be purchased hereunder in order to trigger the co-sale rights
specified herein above 20% or (ii) in any manner that may have a
disproportionate adverse effect on the Non-Affiliated Holders in relation to the

<PAGE>

other holders of Investor Stock, in each case without the written consent of the
Non-Affiliated Holders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
Investor Stock held by all Non-Affiliated Holders on an as-converted basis, and
any such waiver, discharge, termination or amendment, whether retroactively or
prospectively effective, shall be binding on all of the Investors, Management
Holders and Additional Stockholders."

          5. The following Section 4.08 shall be added to the end of Article 4.

          "4.08 Non-Affiliated Director.

paragraph (a)), shall have the right to designate one nominee to serve on the
board of directors of the Company (the "Non-Affiliated Director"), which nominee
must be approved by Non-Affiliated Holders holding at least a majority of the

the Company and to SCANA, such notice specifying the representative of the
Non-Affiliated Holder Majority to whom the Company and SCANA should direct their
acceptance or rejection of the nominee. Within ten business days of receipt of
such written notice from the Non-Affiliated Holder Majority, the board of
directors of the Company and SCANA shall each provide written notice to the
designated representative of the Non-Affiliated Holder Majority of their
acceptance or rejection of the designated nominee. If either the board of
directors of the Company or SCANA reasonably rejects such nominee, the
Non-Affiliated Holders shall have the right to designate additional nominees
until a nominee is accepted by both the board of directors of the Company and
SCANA; provided that if the board of directors of the Company or SCANA
reasonably rejects the second nominee designated by a Non-Affiliated Holders
Majority as provided in this paragraph (a): (1) a Non-Affiliated Holder Majority
shall have the right thereafter, at any time prior to acceptance by the board of
directors of the Company and SCANA of any subsequent nominee, to engage, at the
sole expense of the Company, an internationally recognized director search firm
(the "Search Firm"), which firm shall designate three potential nominees; and
(2) if a Non-Affiliated Holder Majority approves one of such three designees,
the board of directors of the Company and SCANA shall not have the right to
reject the nominee so approved. Any nominee of a Non-Affiliated Holder Majority
designated to serve as the Non-Affiliated Director shall be "independent" within
the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
with respect to the Company and shall execute a non-disclosure agreement with
the Company. The date on which either (x) the board of directors of the Company
and SCANA accept a nominee designated by a Non-Affiliated Holder Majority or (y)
a Non-Affiliated Holder Majority approves a nominee designated by the Search
Firm, as provided herein, shall be referred to as the "Director Designation
Date."

     (b) The board of directors of the Company shall take or cause to be taken
all such action within its power and authority as may be required to, effective
as of the later of (i) the Effective Date, if the Director Designation Date
occurs at least ten business days prior to the Effective Date and (ii) the tenth
business day after the Director Designation Date, expand the size of the board
of directors of the Company by one and appoint. the nominee of the
Non-Affiliated Holders designated as provided in paragraph (a) to fill the
vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors of the Company.

     (c) The board of directors of the Company shall nominate the Non-Affiliated
Director for re-election, or if not already appointed as provided in paragraph
(b), election, to the board of directors to serve for a three-year term
commencing at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the later of
(1) the Effective Date and (2) the Director Designation Date, and shall
recommend such election of the Non-Affiliated Director to the stockholders of
the Company.

<PAGE>

     (d) Each of the stockholders of the Company party to this Agreement (for so
long as such parties own any voting stock of the Company) shall vote all of
their shares of voting stock of the Company in favor of election of the
Non-Affiliated Director.

     (e) The Non-Affiliated Director may be removed only for cause. Upon the
removal for cause, resignation, disability or death of such Non-Affiliated
Director, the board of directors of the Company shall be entitled to designate a
replacement for such Non-Affiliated Director.

     (f) In addition to the requirements of Section 6.05(c) of this Agreement,
this Section 4.08 shall not be amended, waived, discharged or terminated except
by written instrument signed by the Company and the Non-Affiliated Holders
holding at least 75% of the outstanding shares of Investor Stock, on an
as-converted basis, held by all Non-Affiliated Holders, and any such amendment,
waiver, discharge or termination, whether retroactively or prospectively
effective, shall be binding on all of the Investors, Management Holders and
Additional Stockholders.

     (g) Notwithstanding Section 6.10 of this Agreement, this Section 4.08 shall
not terminate upon the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering."

          6. The references in the Agreement to Section 4.4.2(f) of the Amended
and Certificate of Incorporation of the Company are hereby amended to refer to
Section 4.5.2(b). All references in the Agreement to the "Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation" are hereby amended to refer to the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended as of the
Effective Date.

          7. Except as otherwise provided herein, all terms, provisions,
covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of the Agreement shall
remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

          8. This Amendment shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the
State of Georgia as such laws are applied to agreements between Georgia
residents entered into and performed entirely in Georgia, except that the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall govern as to matters of
corporate law.

          9. This Amendment shall become effective on the Effective Date, and
from and after the Effective Date, any reference to the Agreement shall be
deemed to be a reference to the Agreement as amended hereby. If the
Restructuring is not completed by December 31, 2002, this Amendment shall have
no force or effect.

          10. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in the Agreement.

          11. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument.

of Investor Stock and the number of shares held by each as of the date hereof.
