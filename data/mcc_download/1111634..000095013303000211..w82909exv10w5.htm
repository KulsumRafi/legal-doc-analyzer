<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement as of January&nbsp;16, 2003 by and among Starfire Holding Corporation
(&#147;Parent&#148;), a Delaware corporation, having offices at 767 Fifth Avenue, New
York and XO Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;XO&#148;), having
offices at 11111 Sunset Hills Road, Reston Virginia, 20160 and the XO
Subsidiaries (as defined below).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent is the common parent of an affiliated group (as such term
is defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any succeeding
law (the &#147;Code&#148;)) of corporations for federal income tax purposes which
includes the XO Group (as defined below):
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent and its subsidiaries have been filing consolidated federal
income tax returns (&#147;Consolidated Federal Returns&#148;) and will continue to file
Consolidated Federal Returns for all periods in which Parent and XO are members
of an affiliated group (as defined in the Code);
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is contemplated that the XO Group will continue to file
separate state income or franchise tax returns unless Parent elects to file
such returns on a consolidated or combined basis with the XO Group
(&#147;Consolidated State Returns&#148;);
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, XO is undergoing a restructuring of its equity and debt pursuant
to a bankruptcy plan (the &#147;Restructuring&#148;);
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, upon completion of the Restructuring, XO will have minority
shareholders and third-party lenders; and
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent and XO believe it is desirable to provide for the
allocation and payment of federal and state income tax liabilities and certain
related matters.
</FONT>
