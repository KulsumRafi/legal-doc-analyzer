<P><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><U></U></P>

<P align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><U>EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</U></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT>		EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of January 1, 2002 (the
"Employment Agreement"), by and between TheStreet.com, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or "TheStreet.com"), and Thomas J. Clarke, Jr.
("Clarke").</P>

<P>		WHEREAS, the Company desires that Clarke enter into this Employment Agreement, and Clarke desires to enter into this Employment Agreement, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein; and</P>

<P>		NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:</P>

<P>		<U>Section 1.</U>  <U>Duties; Term.</U></P>

<P>		The Company agrees to employ Clarke, and Clarke agrees to be so
employed, in the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
and Clarke agrees to perform such duties, functions and responsibilities as are
generally incident to such positions, for a period commencing on January 1, 2002
and ending on December 31, 2003, unless sooner terminated in accordance with
Section 4 hereof (the "Term").  Clarke agrees to perform faithfully the duties
assigned to him pursuant to this Employment Agreement to the best of his abilities
and to devote all of his business time and attention to the Company's business.
Clarke shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations and policies as are from time to
time applicable to employees of the Company, including TheStreet.com's Policy on
Investments.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 2.</U>  <U>Compensation.</U></P>

<P>		(a)  <U>Annual Salary</U>.  As compensation for his services hereunder, during
the Term the Company shall pay to Clarke a salary of Three Hundred and Fifty-Six
Thousand Dollars ($356,000) per annum, payable in accordance with the Company's
standard payroll policies, and less all applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes (the "Annual Salary").  The Annual Salary shall be reviewed at least annually
during the Term, and may be increased in the sole discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), taking into consideration both the Company's and Clarke's performance during the preceding year.</P>

<P>		(b)  <U>Bonus</U>.  Except as set forth in Section 4 hereof, in addition to the
Annual Salary, Clarke shall be entitled to receive additional bonus compensation for
his employment during calendar years 2002 and 2003 (the "Annual Bonus") in
accordance with the mutually agreed upon bonus schedule for senior management of
the Company, which shall be based upon achievement of the Company's financial
goals as submitted to the Board. </P>

<P>		(c)  <U>Options</U>.  The Company shall grant to Clarke, in addition to stock
options previously granted pursuant to the terms of the TheStreet.com, Inc.
Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan") and
option agreements dated October 18, 1999, December 8, 1999, April 18, 2000 and
November 30, 2000 (collectively, the "Old Option Agreements"), pursuant to a stock
option agreement dated the date hereof (the "New Option Agreement"), stock
options to purchase an aggregate of Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of
Common Stock in the Company.  The grant shall be an non-qualified stock option.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 3.</U>  <U>Benefits; Expense Reimbursement.</U></P>

<P>		During the Term, Clarke shall participate in any group insurance,
accident, sickness and hospitalization insurance, and any other employee benefit
plans of the Company in effect during the Term and available to the Company's
executive officers, and Clarke shall have the right to reimbursement, upon proper
accounting, of reasonable expenses and disbursements incurred by him in the course
of his duties hereunder.  Clarke shall also receive reimbursement of up to $1,250 per
month to defray business expenses.  In addition, during each year of the Term,
Clarke shall be entitled to three (3) weeks of paid vacation.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 4.</U>  <U>Employment Termination.</U></P>

<P>		(a)  At any time during the Term, and except as otherwise provided in
Sections 4(b) and 4(c) hereof, the Company shall only have the right to terminate
this Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment with the Company hereunder,
upon written notice to Clarke, in the event Clarke engages in conduct which
constitutes "Cause."  For purposes of this Employment Agreement, Cause shall
mean (i) Clarke's willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of his
obligations under this Employment Agreement, (ii) dishonesty or misappropriation
by Clarke relating to the Company or any of its funds, properties, or other assets,
(iii) inexcusable repeated or prolonged absence from work by Clarke (other than as a
result of, or in connection with, a disability), (iv) any unauthorized disclosure by
Clarke of confidential or proprietary information of the Company which is reasonably likely to result in material harm to the Company, (v) a conviction of Clarke
(including entry of a guilty or nolo contendere plea) involving fraud, dishonesty,
moral turpitude, or involving a violation of federal or state securities laws, or (vi) the
failure by Clarke to perform faithfully his duties hereunder or other breach by Clarke
of this Employment Agreement and such failure or breach is not cured, to the extent
cure is possible, by Clarke within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
the Company to Clarke.  If this Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment
with the Company hereunder is terminated for Cause, or if Clarke voluntarily resigns
from the Company without Good Reason, during the Term, the Company shall pay
Clarke an amount equal to all earned but unpaid portions of the Annual Salary and
unused vacation days through the date of termination, and following any such
termination, Clarke shall not be entitled to receive any other compensation or
benefits from the Company hereunder, including, without limitation, any portion of
the Annual Bonus for the year in which he is terminated.</P>

<P>		(b)  This Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment with the
Company hereunder may also be terminated by the Company without Cause, or by
Clarke upon the occurrence of an event constituting Good Reason.  For purposes of
this Employment Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean (i) the failure of the
Company to cure a material adverse change made by it in Clarke's functions, duties,
or responsibilities in his position with the Company as provided in this Employment
Agreement, or (ii) a reduction in the Annual Salary during the Term, or (iii) the
failure of the Company to cure any other material breach of this Employment
Agreement, or (iv) in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control (as
such term is defined in the Company's 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended) of
the Company, there is a significant reduction of Clarke's duties or responsibilities
relative to his duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, <U>that</U> the foregoing provision shall not include a reduction in
duties or responsibilities solely by virtue of the Company being acquired and made
part of a larger entity (as, for example, if you are not appointed as Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the acquiring corporation, but continue to have a substantially similar level of responsibility over the affairs of the Company following
such Change of Control), or (v) Clarke's relocation by the Company or a successor
thereto to a location more than fifty (50) miles from either the Company's current
headquarters or Bridgewater, New Jersey, <U>provided</U> <U>that</U>, in the case of (i), (ii), or
(iii) above, the Company has failed to cure the event constituting Good Reason
within sixty (60) days following written notice thereof from Clarke.  In the event that
Clarke's employment with the Company shall terminate during the Term on account
of termination by the Company without Cause, or by Clarke with Good Reason, then
the Company shall pay or provide to Clarke, as his sole and exclusive remedy
hereunder, (A) an amount equal to all earned but unpaid portions of the Annual
Salary and unused vacation days through the date of termination, (B) a portion of
the Annual Bonus prorated through the date of termination, (C) group life, disability,
sickness, hospitalization and accident insurance benefits equivalent to those to
which Clarke would have been entitled if he had continued working for the Company for an additional twelve (12) month period, and (D) the Annual Salary to the
same extent to which Clarke would have been entitled if he had continued working
for the Company for an additional twelve (12) month period, or, at the Company's
option, in a lump sum payment appropriately discounted for the time value of money
at the Treasury bill or note rate.  The benefits continuation and salary payments
provided for in (C) and (D) above shall be contingent upon Clarke's continued
compliance with Sections 5 and 6 hereof, and shall be reduced by the corresponding
benefits amounts and amounts of cash compensation and any publicly traded or
freely tradable securities compensation (including, without limitation, securities that
will become freely tradable after a restrictive or vesting period) actually received by
Clarke after the date of termination in connection with "Replacement Employment"
(as defined below).  Clarke shall make good faith efforts to obtain Replacement
Employment which is similar in duties and responsibilities to that provided for
Clarke hereunder.  Except as set forth above, Clarke shall not be entitled to receive
any other compensation or benefits from the Company hereunder.   </P>

<P>		(c)  This Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment with the
Company hereunder shall terminate immediately and automatically upon (i) the
death or Disability (as defined below) of Clarke or (ii) the expiration of the Term.
For purposes of this Employment Agreement, "Disability" shall mean physical or
mental incapacity of a nature which prevents Clarke, in the good faith judgment of
the Company's Board of Directors, from performing his duties under this Employment Agreement for a period of 90 consecutive days or 150 days during any year
with each year under this Employment Agreement commencing on each anniversary
of the date hereof.  If this Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment with
the Company hereunder is terminated on account of (i) or (ii) above, then the
Company shall pay Clarke, or his estate, conservator or designated beneficiary, as
the case may be, an amount equal to (A) all earned but unpaid portions of the
Annual Salary and unused vacation days through the date of termination, and (B) a
portion of the Annual Bonus prorated through the date of termination, and following
any such termination, neither Clarke, nor his estate, conservator or designated
beneficiary, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive any other compensation
or benefits from the Company hereunder, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if Clarke's
employment is terminated on account of (ii) above, and the Company has not
previously offered to renew this Employment Agreement on commercially reasonable terms as determined by the Company in good faith, then the Company shall also
pay or provide to Clarke (C) group life, disability, sickness, hospitalization and
accident insurance benefits equivalent to those to which Clarke would have been
entitled if he had continued working for the Company for an additional twelve (12)
month period, and (D) the Annual Salary to the same extent to which Clarke would
have been entitled if he had continued working for the Company for an additional
twelve (12) month period, or, at the Company's option, in a lump sum payment
appropriately discounted for the time value of money at the Treasury bill or note
rate.  The benefits continuation and salary payments provided for in (C) and (D)
above shall be contingent upon Clarke's continued compliance with Sections 5 and 6
hereof, and shall be reduced by the corresponding amounts actually received by
Clarke after the date of termination in connection with "Replacement Employment,"
as described in Section 4(b) hereof.</P>

<P>		(d)  This Employment Agreement and Clarke's employment with the
Company hereunder shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the final
and complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or a final and complete
shutdown of the business then conducted by the Company<STRONG> </STRONG>(each, a "Liquidation
Event").  In the event that Clarke remains employed by the Company under this
Employment Agreement until the time of any Liquidation Event, then the Company
shall pay to Clarke, as his sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, an amount equal to
his then-current Annual Salary, less any amounts required to be withheld by law.</P>

<P>		(e)  Upon the termination of this Employment Agreement pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, the Company shall have no further obligations under this Employment Agreement; <U>provided</U>, (except for amounts payable in Section 2 thru 4 above)
<U>however</U>, that Sections 5 through 18 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and
effect.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 5.</U>  <U>Non-Competition.</U></P>

<P>		(a)  Clarke hereby agrees that, during the period from the Commencement Date through the end of the first twelve (12) months after the cessation of
Clarke's employment with the Company, he will not engage in "Competition" with
the Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, Competition by Clarke shall mean
Clarke's engaging in, or otherwise directly or indirectly being employed by or acting
as a consultant or lender to, or being a director, officer, employee, principal, agent,
stockholder, member, owner or partner of, or permitting his name to be used in
connection with the activities of any other business or organization anywhere in the
United States which primarily engages in the business of providing original editorial
financial news and commentary over the Internet;<EM> </EM><U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of this Section 5(a) for Clarke to
become the registered or beneficial owner of up to three percent (3%) of any class of
the capital stock of a competing corporation registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided that Clarke does not otherwise participate in the business of such corporation.</P>

<P>		(b)  Clarke hereby agrees that, during the period from the Commencement Date through the end of the first twelve (12) months after the cessation of
Clarke's employment with the Company, he will not solicit for employment or hire,
in any business enterprise or activity, any person who was employed by the Company during the Term.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 6.</U>  <U>Confidentiality; Intellectual Property.</U></P>

<P>		(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Employment Agreement, at all
times during and after the Term, Clarke shall keep secret and retain in strictest
confidence, any and all confidential information relating to the Company, and shall
use such confidential information only in furtherance of the performance by him of
his duties to the Company and not for personal benefit or the benefit of any interest
adverse to the Company's interests. For purposes of this Agreement, "confidential
information" shall mean any information including without limitation plans,
specifications, models, samples, data, customer lists and customer information,
computer programs and documentation, and other technical and/or business information, in whatever form, tangible or intangible, that can be communicated by
whatever means available at such time, that relates to the Company's current
business or future business contemplated during the Term, products, services and
development, or information received from others that the Company is obligated to
treat as confidential or proprietary (<U>provided</U> <U>that</U> such confidential information shall
not include any information that (a) has become generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure by Clarke, or (b) was available to or became
known to Clarke prior to the disclosure of such information on a non-confidential
basis without breach of any duty of confidentiality from any party to the Company),
and Clarke shall not disclose such confidential information to any Person other than
the Company, except as may be required by law or court or administrative order (in
which event Clarke shall so notify the Company as promptly as practicable). Upon
termination of the Term for any reason, Clarke shall return to the Company all
copies, reproductions and summaries of confidential information in his possession
and erase the same from all media in his possession, and, if the Company so
requests, shall certify in writing that he has done so. All confidential information is
and shall remain the property of the Company (or, in the case of information that the
Company receives from a third party which it is obligated to treat as confidential,
then the property of such third party).</P>

<P>		(b)  All Intellectual Property (as hereinafter defined) and Technology (as
hereinafter defined) created, developed, obtained or conceived of by Clarke during
the Term, and all business opportunities presented to Clarke during the Term, shall
be owned by and belong exclusively to the Company, provided that they reasonably
relate to any of the business of the Company on the date of such creation, development, obtaining or conception, and Clarke shall (i) promptly disclose any such
Intellectual Property, Technology or business opportunity to the Company, and (ii)
execute and deliver to the Company, without additional compensation, such instruments as the Company may require from time to time to evidence its ownership of
any such Intellectual Property, Technology or business opportunity. For purposes of
this Employment Agreement, (x) the term "Intellectual Property" means and
includes any and all trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names, patents,
copyrights, and applications therefor, and (y) the term "Technology" means and
includes any and all trade secrets, proprietary information, invention, discoveries,
know-how, formulae, processes and procedures.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 7.</U>  <U>Covenants Reasonable.</U></P>

<P>		The parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in Sections 5 and
6 hereof are a reasonable and necessary protection of the immediate interests of the
Company, and any violation of these restrictions would cause substantial injury to
the Company and that the Company would not have entered into this Employment
Agreement, without receiving the additional consideration offered by Clarke in
binding himself to any of these restrictions. In the event of a breach or threatened
breach by Clarke of any of these restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to apply
to any court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction restraining Clarke from such
breach or threatened breach; <U>provided</U> <U>however</U>, that the right to apply for an
injunction shall not be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any
other available remedies for such breach or threatened breach.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 8.</U>  <U>No Third Party Beneficiary.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed
to confer any rights or remedies hereunder upon any Person, other than the parties
hereto or their permitted assigns. "Person" shall mean an individual, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, association, trust
or other unincorporated organization or entity.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 9.</U>  <U>Notices.</U></P>

<P>		Unless otherwise provided herein, any notice, exercise of rights or other
communication required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be given by overnight delivery service such as Federal Express, telecopy (or
like transmission) or personal delivery against receipt, or mailed by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested), to the party to whom it is given at such
party's address set forth below such party's name on the signature page or such other
address as such party may hereafter specify by notice to the other party hereto. Any
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been given as of the date so
personally delivered or transmitted by telecopy or like transmission or on the next
business day when sent by overnight delivery service.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 10.</U>  <U>Representations.</U></P>

<P>		The Company hereby represents and warrants that the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the
Company.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 11.</U>  <U>Amendment.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 12.</U>  <U>Binding Effect.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement is not assignable by Clarke. None of
Clarke's rights under this Employment Agreement shall be subject to any encumbrances or the claims of Clarke's creditors. This Employment Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor organization which shall succeed to the Company by merger or consolidation or operation of
law, or by acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (provided that a successor by way of acquisition of assets shall have undertaken in
writing to assume the obligations of the Company hereunder).</P>

<P>		<U>Section 13.</U>  <U>Governing Law.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to
be performed wholly within the state and without regard to its conflict of laws
provisions.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 14.</U>  <U>Severability.</U></P>

<P>		If any provision of this Employment Agreement, including those contained in Sections 5 and 6 hereof, shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby.  Moreover, if any one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement, including those contained in Sections 5 and 6 hereof,
shall be held to be excessively broad as to duration, activity or subject, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and reducing them so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent allowable by applicable law.  To the extent permitted by applicable
law, each party hereto waives any provision of law that renders any provision of this
Employment Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any way.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 15.</U>  <U>Execution in Counterparts.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 16.</U>  <U>Entire Agreement.</U></P>

<P>		This Employment Agreement, together with the Old Option Agreements
and the New Option Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 17.</U>  <U>Titles and Headings.</U></P>

<P>		Titles and headings to Sections herein are for purposes of reference only,
and shall in no way limit, define or otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of
any of the provisions of this Employment Agreement. </P>

<P>		<U>Section 18.</U>  <U>Conflicts of Interest.</U></P>

<P>		Clarke specifically covenants, warrants and represents to the Company
that he has the full, complete and entire right and authority to enter into this Employment Agreement, that he has no agreement, duty, commitment or responsibility
of any kind or nature whatsoever with any corporation, partnership, firm, company,
joint venture or other entity or other Person which would conflict in any manner
whatsoever with any of his duties, obligations or responsibilities to the Company
pursuant to this Employment Agreement, that he is not in possession of any document or other tangible property of any other Person of a confidential or proprietary
nature which would conflict in any manner whatsoever with any of his duties,
obligations or responsibilities to the Company pursuant to his Employment Agreement, and that he is fully ready, willing and able to perform each and all of his
duties, obligations and responsibilities to the Company pursuant to this Employment
Agreement.</P>

<P>		<U>Section 19.</U>  <U>Consent to Jurisdiction.</U></P>

<P>		Clarke hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any New York
State or Federal court sitting in the City of New York in any action or proceeding to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, and waives the defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding.</P>
