    non-transferable license to (i) use the Licensed Products for the limited
    purpose of in-house development by Licensee of the Authorized Derivative

    the Authorized Derivative Services to End Users in digital, vector-based

    panned or zoomed by End Users, provided that a manual request by the End
    User is required for each pan or zoom of the Map Image.

    a. No Other Derivative Services. The license granted herein does not
       ----------------------------
       authorize or permit Licensee to create Derivative Services other than the
       Authorized Derivative Services. If Licensee desires to create Derivative
       Services other than the Authorized Derivative Services, Licensee shall
       notify TANA and the Parties shall bargain in good faith for any
       additional license rights to create such Derivative Services.

    b. Sublicense Requirements.
       -----------------------

                  (i) Prior to Access. Except as provided in subsection (ii)
                      ---------------
                  below, on any Web Site through which an End User accesses
                  Authorized Derivative Services, Licensee or Reseller(s) shall,
                  in accordance with the timing set forth below, (a) present a
                  notice, which is in conspicuous type and must necessarily and

                  User's use of the Authorized Derivative Services is subject to

                  (b) provide the End User an agreement containing all the terms
                  and conditions set forth in Exhibit A hereto. To satisfy the
                  aforementioned sublicense requirements when the Authorized
                  Derivative Services are provided on a Web Site, Licensee or
                  Reseller(s) shall include, on an initial web page that must

                  the following notice in conspicuous type located Above the
                  Fold for such web page: "By clicking on the '[ text displayed
                  on the button to access the Authorized Derivative Services,
                  for example: GO!]' button, you agree to the attached license
                  agreement."; the words "license agreement" shall be underlined
                  and highlighted in a different color so that when clicked upon

                  home page within a commercially reasonable time frame, and by
                  each Reseller as provided in any agreement between Licensee
                  and the Reseller pursuant to the following sentence. Licensee
                  shall enter into an agreement, which complies with this
                  Section 2(b)(i), with each Reseller as soon as commercially
                  reasonable, and shall use reasonable efforts to do so no later
                  than the effective date of (a) a new agreement between the
                  Reseller and Licensee, (b) the renewal or amendment of an
                  existing agreement between the Reseller and Licensee or (c)
                  similar such change in the contractual relationship between
                  the Reseller and Licensee; [**]

                  (ii) Immediately Below Map Images and Text Directions.
                       ------------------------------------------------
                  Licensee or Reseller(s) shall include the following notice in
                  conspicuous type immediately below all Map Images and text
                  directions provided as part of the Authorized Derivative
                  Services: "Use subject to License." The word "License" shall
                                            -------
                  be underlined and highlighted in a different color so that
                  when clicked upon it serves as a link to an agreement
                  containing all the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit A
                  hereto. This requirement shall be in addition to the
                  requirements set forth in subsection (i) above with respect to
                  Authorized Derivative Services accessed through a Web Site
                  offering map searching capabilities, [**]


                                       2

                  (e.g., where a single map is displayed via a link
                  from a directory listing).

                  (iii) Section 2(b) Intent. The Parties intend that
                        -------------------
                  implementing the sublicensing requirements specified in this
                  Section 2(b) will both (a) cause each End User to be subject
                  to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit A hereto and
                  (b) with respect to the subject matter addressed in Section
                  2(b), provide a level of protection for TANA's intellectual
                  property that is at least equal to the standard level of
                  protection for the intellectual property of companies
                  operating within the mapping industry. If TANA provides
                  Licensee with reasonable evidence that implementing Section
                  2(b), either does not (a) cause each End User to be subject to
                  the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit A hereto or (b)
                  provide a level of protection for TANA's intellectual property
                  that is at least equal to the above specified standard level
                  of protection, then the Parties shall amend Section 2(b) so
                  that implementing Section 2(b) does satisfy both (a) and (b)
                  herein.

    c. Copyrights. All Map Images and text directions provided as part of the
       ----------
       Authorized Derivative Services shall include the following notice
       conspicuously displayed within the Map Image or immediately below the
       text directions: "(C) 1984-[current year] Tele Atlas N. Am." Where space
       permits, the notice may be expanded to read, "Map data (C) 1984 -
       [current year. TeleAtlas North America, Inc. All rights reserved.

    d. No Patent License. Nothing in the GP Agreement or this License, including
       -----------------

       granted or to be granted to TANA or any patent applications, filed or
       unfiled. A current list of TANA's issued patents can be found on the

       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE

       NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TANA OR ANY OF ITS
       AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY, AND LICENSEE IS NOT ENTITLED
       TO RELY ON ANY SUCH ADVICE OR INFORMATION. In the event that Licensee
       requests, and TANA, in its sole discretion, agrees to provide technical
       support for any of the Discontinued Licensed Products, Licensee agrees to
       pay for such technical support at TANA's then current standard hourly
