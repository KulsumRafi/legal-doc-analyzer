                              (TO BE RENAMED

                              NTL INCORPORATED)



                             DEMERGER AGREEMENT



<PAGE>



THIS AGREEMENT is made on January 10, 2003

BETWEEN:

(1)      NTL INCORPORATED, to be renamed NTL Europe, Inc, a corporation
         incorporated in the State of Delaware, whose principal office will,
         following the Effective Date, be located at 37 Purchase Street, Rye,
         New York 10580 ("Euroco"); and

(2)      NTL COMMUNICATIONS CORP., to be renamed NTL Incorporated, a
         corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware, whose principal
         office is located at 110 East 59th Street, 26th Floor, New York, New
         York 10022, USA ("New NTL").

WHEREAS:

(A)      Euroco and certain of its subsidiaries (including New NTL) filed a
         joint reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of the United States
         Bankruptcy Code on May 8, 2002 which was amended on May 24, 2002 and
         further amended on July 15, 2002, and modified on September 5, 2002
         (as further amended, modified, or supplemented, the "Plan").

(B)      On September 5, 2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
         Southern District of New York entered an order confirming the Plan.

(C)      Pursuant to the Plan, it is proposed that Euroco and its subsidiaries
         will divide their current businesses and investments into two new
         groups, the Euroco Group and the New NTL Group, the holding companies
         for which will be Euroco and New NTL, respectively.

(D)      During the period prior to the filing of the Plan, the various
         members of the Euroco Group entered into various contracts in
         relation to the acquisition of Assets which, on the Effective Date,
         will be held within the New NTL Group (collectively, but excluding
         the contracts listed in the Schedule to this Agreement, the
         "Contracts"). The Euroco Group has the benefit of certain warranties
         and representations under the Contracts (the "Contract Rights") and
         the benefit of covenants to pay or indemnities under the Contracts
         (the "Received Covenants") and may be liable under certain other
         covenants to pay or indemnities under the Contracts (the "Given
         Covenants"), in each case with respect to the Assets held within the
         New NTL Group on the Effective Date. The parties intend that the New
         NTL Group should have the benefit of the Contract Rights and the
         Received Covenants, and the burden of the Given Covenants with effect
         from the Effective Date.

2.       DECLARATION OF TRUST OVER CONTRACT RIGHTS

         In consideration for New NTL giving the covenant contained in
         clause 3.1 of this Agreement, Euroco hereby declares, and shall
         procure that each of its Group Companies declares, with effect
         from the Effective Date and in favour of New NTL, a trust of the
         benefit of any and all Contract Rights and Received Covenants.
         New NTL shall have the right to assign any benefit under this
         trust to its Group Companies.

3.       UNDERTAKINGS IN RELATION TO GIVEN COVENANTS

3.1      Subject to each of the Indemnified Persons (as defined below)
         complying with their obligations under this clause 3 as parties
         to, or as if they were parties to, this agreement, New NTL hereby
         covenants and agrees to indemnify Euroco and its directors,
         officers, employees, and agents and their respective successors
         and assigns (together, the "Indemnified Persons") and to hold
         them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims,
         liabilities, obligations, fines, penalties, damages and expenses,
         including reasonable legal fees and any costs of enforcement of
         this clause (collectively, "Losses") incurred by any of them
         resulting from or arising out of any Given Covenants which Euroco
         or any of its Group Companies has given PROVIDED THAT no
         Indemnified Person may claim under this clause 3.1 if he, she or
         it has done any act (other than in relation to inconsequential
         amendments pursuant to clause 3.6) in relation to any Given
         Covenant after the Effective Date without the prior written
         consent of New NTL.

3.2      Subject to clause 3.1, Euroco shall procure that New NTL shall have
         sole conduct of any claim under the Given Covenants.

3.3      Within thirty (30) days after the date on which an Indemnified
         Person has actual knowledge of the existence of any claim for
         indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Person
         shall provide written notice to New NTL pursuant to this


                                     3
<PAGE>

         clause 3 of any such claim. Such notice shall specify the nature
         of such claim in reasonable detail and New NTL shall be given
         reasonable access to any documents or properties within the
         control of the Indemnified Person or Euroco as may be useful or
         necessary in the investigation of the basis for such claim. The
         failure to so notify New NTL shall not constitute a waiver of such
         claim but an Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to receive
         any indemnification with respect to any Losses that occurred
         directly as a result of the failure of such Indemnified Person to
         give such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, New NTL agrees to
         reimburse any Indemnified Person for all such Losses, other than
         third-party claims for which the procedure is described in clause
         3.4, as they are incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Person.

3.4      In the event any Indemnified Person seeks indemnification hereunder
         based upon a claim asserted by a third party, New NTL shall (without
         prejudice to the right of any Indemnified Person to be represented by
         legal advisers of its own choosing) defend or prosecute such claim at
         its expense and through legal advisers of its own choosing; provided,
         however, that, if the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
         concluded that it requires separate legal advice because a conflict
         of interest would otherwise exist, the Indemnified Person shall have
         the right to select separate legal advisers reasonably acceptable to
         New NTL to participate in the defence of such action on its behalf,
         at the expense of New NTL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if New NTL
         does not defend or prosecute any such claim asserted by a third party
         for which any Indemnified Person would be entitled to indemnification
         hereunder, then the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover
         from New NTL on a monthly basis all of the reasonable legal fees and
         other costs and expenses of litigation of any nature whatsoever
         incurred in the defence of such claim. Notwithstanding the assumption
         of the defence of any claim by New NTL pursuant to this paragraph,
         the Indemnified Person (except if Euroco is the Indemnified Person
         and the settlement involves Euroco giving no undertakings) shall have
         the right to approve such terms of any settlement of a claim as apply
         specifically to the Indemnified Person (which approval shall not be
         unreasonably delayed or withheld).

3.5      New NTL and the Indemnified Person shall co-operate in furnishing
         evidence and statements and in any other manner which the other may
         reasonably request, and shall in all other respects act in good faith
         to the other, so as not to unreasonably expose the other to undue
         risk of loss.

3.6      Euroco undertakes, and shall procure that the other members of the
         Euroco Group shall undertake, to New NTL not to amend or supplement
         any of the Contracts in any manner whatsoever (other than to update
         details of where notices are to be delivered and inconsequential
         amendments which do not immediately or in the


                                     4
<PAGE>

         future create or increase any liability or obligation of any
         member of the New NTL Group under the Contracts, this Agreement or
         otherwise) and not to make any admission of liability, agreement
         or compromise with any person, body or authority in relation to
         any claim related to the Contracts and Euroco agrees to make such
         amendments and supplements to the Contracts as New NTL may
         reasonably request.

3.7      Each of the Indemnified Persons shall not make any admission of
         liability, agreement or compromise with any person, body or authority
         in relation to any claim related to the Contracts.

4.       ACCESS TO INFORMATION

         For a period of ten years from the date of this Agreement, each
         party shall, and shall procure that its Group Companies shall,
         allow the other party and its personnel to have access to (during
         normal business hours and following not less than 48 hours'
         notice) and (at the expense of the party requesting the
         information) take copies of all documents, records or other
         materials containing any information which that party or any of
         its Group Companies or affiliated joint ventures might reasonably
         require to be able to comply with their respective legal,
         regulatory, accounting or filing obligations, or to resist,
         appeal, dispute, avoid or compromise any tax assessment, provided
         that nothing in this clause shall permit either party to copy any
         document, record or other material which is subject to legal
         privilege. Furthermore, each party shall, and shall procure that
         its Group Companies shall, allow reasonable access to such of its
         duly authorised personnel, at all reasonable times during business
         hours upon prior written notice, as are required to permit the
         availability, access or, subject to the above restriction, copying
         of such information.

5.       COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed as two or more counterparts and
         execution by each of the parties of any one of such counterparts
         will constitute due execution of this Agreement.

6.       FURTHER ASSURANCE

         Each party shall, and shall use all reasonable endeavours to
         procure that any necessary Group Company or third party shall, do,
         execute and perform all such further deeds, documents assurances,
         acts and things as may reasonably be required to give effect to
         this Agreement.
