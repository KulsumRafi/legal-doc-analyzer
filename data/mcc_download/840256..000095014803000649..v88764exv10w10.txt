                                   DEBENTURES

         SECTION 2.1.      AUTHENTICATION AND DATING. Upon the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, or from time to time thereafter, Debentures in an
aggregate principal amount not in excess of $5,000,000.00 may be executed and
delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee
shall thereupon authenticate and make available for delivery said Debentures to
or upon the written order of the Company, signed by its Chairman of the Board of
Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman, President, one of its
Managing Directors or one of its Vice Presidents without any further action by
the Company hereunder. In authenticating such Debentures, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debentures,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be
fully protected in relying upon:

         (a)      a copy of any Board Resolution or Board Resolutions relating
thereto and, if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken pursuant
to such resolution, in each case certified by the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of the Company, as the case may be; and

         (b)      an Opinion of Counsel prepared in accordance with Section 14.6
which shall also state:

                  (1)      that such Debentures, when authenticated and
         delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in each case in the
         manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of
         Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
         Company, subject to or limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, conservatorship, receivership, moratorium and other
         statutory or decisional laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
         or the reorganization of financial institutions (including, without
         limitation, preference and fraudulent conveyance or transfer laws),
         heretofore or hereafter enacted or in effect, affecting the rights of
         creditors generally; and

                  (2)      that all laws and requirements in respect of the
         execution and delivery by the Company of the Debentures have been
         complied with and that authentication and delivery of the Debentures by
         the Trustee will not violate the terms of this Indenture.

         The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver
any Debentures under this Section if the Trustee, being advised in writing by
counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such
action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing holders.

                                       5

<PAGE>

         The definitive Debentures shall be typed, printed, lithographed or
engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all
as determined by the officers executing such Debentures, as evidenced by their
execution of such Debentures.

         SECTION 2.2.      FORM OF TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION. The
Trustee's certificate of authentication on all Debentures shall be in
substantially the following form:

         This is one of the Debentures referred to in the within-mentioned
Indenture.

         State Street Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut, National
Association, as Trustee

         By________________________________________________
         Authorized Signer

         SECTION 2.3.      FORM AND DENOMINATION OF DEBENTURES. The Debentures
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. The Debentures
shall be in registered, certificated form without coupons and in minimum
denominations of $100,000.00 and any multiple of $1,000.00 in excess thereof.
Any attempted transfer of the Debentures in a block having an aggregate
principal amount of less than $100,000.00 shall be deemed to be voided and of no
legal effect whatsoever. Any such purported transferee shall be deemed not to be
a holder of such Debentures for any purpose, including, but not limited to the
receipt of payments on such Debentures, and such purported transferee shall be
deemed to have no interest whatsoever in such Debentures. The Debentures shall
be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in
accordance with such plans as the officers executing the same may determine with
the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication
thereof.

         SECTION 2.4.      EXECUTION OF DEBENTURES. The Debentures shall be
signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile
signature of its Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer,
Vice Chairman, President, one of its Managing Directors or one of its Vice
Presidents. Only such Debentures as shall bear thereon a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form herein before recited, executed by the
Trustee or the Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of an authorized
signer, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent upon any Debenture executed by the Company shall be
conclusive evidence that the Debenture so authenticated has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the
benefits of this Indenture.

         In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the
Debentures shall cease to be such officer before the Debentures so signed shall
have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or the Authenticating
Agent, or disposed of by the Company, such Debentures nevertheless may be
authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed such
Debentures had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Debenture
may be signed on behalf of the Company by such Persons as, at the actual date of
the execution of such Debenture, shall be the proper officers of the Company,
although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not
such an officer.

         Every Debenture shall be dated the date of its authentication.

         SECTION 2.5.      EXCHANGE AND REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER OF DEBENTURES.
The Company shall cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained for the
purpose of registration of transfer and for exchange as provided in Section 3.2,
a register (the "Debenture Register") for the Debentures issued hereunder in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration and transfer of all Debentures as in this
Article II provided. The Debenture Register

                                       6

<PAGE>

shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into
written form within a reasonable time.

         Debentures to be exchanged may be surrendered at the Principal Office
of the Trustee or at any office or agency to be maintained by the Company for
such purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the Company shall execute, the
Company or the Trustee shall register and the Trustee or the Authenticating
Agent shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor
the Debenture or Debentures which the Securityholder making the exchange shall
be entitled to receive. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any
Debenture at the Principal Office of the Trustee or at any office or agency of
the Company maintained for such purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Company
shall execute, the Company or the Trustee shall register and the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and make available for delivery in the
name of the transferee or transferees a new Debenture for a like aggregate
principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Debenture by
the Trustee or by any agent of the Company appointed pursuant to Section 3.2,
and delivery of such Debenture, shall be deemed to complete the registration or
registration of transfer of such Debenture.

         All Debentures presented for registration of transfer or for exchange
or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent duly executed by the holder or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.

         No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of
transfer of Debentures, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection therewith.

         The Company or the Trustee shall not be required to exchange or
register a transfer of any Debenture for a period of 15 days next preceding the
date of selection of Debentures for redemption.

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Debentures may not be
transferred except in compliance with the restricted securities legend set forth
below, unless otherwise determined by the Company, upon the advice of counsel
expert in securities law, in accordance with applicable law:

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION.

         THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,

AN INSTITUTIONAL "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" WITHIN THE MEANING OF SUBPARAGRAPH (A) OF
RULE 501 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY FOR ITS OWN
ACCOUNT, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF SUCH AN INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTOR, FOR
INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR OFFER OR SALE IN CONNECTION
WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (F) PURSUANT TO

TRANSFER TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR
OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INDENTURE, A COPY OF
WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE COMPANY.

         THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF ALSO AGREES,
REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT, INDIVIDUAL
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT SUBJECT TO TITLE I OF THE
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED ("ERISA"), OR
SECTION 4975 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE "CODE") (EACH
A "PLAN"), OR AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE "PLAN ASSETS" BY REASON
OF ANY PLAN'S INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY, AND NO PERSON INVESTING "PLAN ASSETS" OF
ANY PLAN MAY ACQUIRE OR HOLD THE SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN, UNLESS SUCH
PURCHASER OR HOLDER IS ELIGIBLE FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF AVAILABLE UNDER U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PROHIBITED TRANSACTION CLASS EXEMPTION 96-23, 95-60, 91-38,
90-1 OR 84-14 OR ANOTHER APPLICABLE EXEMPTION OR ITS PURCHASE AND HOLDING OF
THIS SECURITY IS NOT PROHIBITED BY SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE
CODE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PURCHASE OR HOLDING. ANY PURCHASER OR HOLDER OF THE
SECURITIES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE REPRESENTED BY ITS
PURCHASE AND HOLDING THEREOF THAT EITHER (i) IT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, OR A PLAN TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF
THE CODE IS APPLICABLE, A TRUSTEE OR OTHER PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN OR PLAN, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY USING THE ASSETS OF
ANY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN OR PLAN TO FINANCE SUCH PURCHASE, OR (ii) SUCH
PURCHASE WILL NOT RESULT IN A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA
OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE FOR WHICH THERE IS NO APPLICABLE STATUTORY OR
ADMINISTRATIVE EXEMPTION.

         THIS SECURITY WILL BE ISSUED AND MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN BLOCKS
HAVING AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOT LESS THAN $100,000.00 AND MULTIPLES
OF $1,000.00 IN EXCESS THEREOF. ANY ATTEMPTED TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN A
BLOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF LESS THAN $100,000.00 SHALL BE
DEEMED TO BE VOID AND OF NO LEGAL EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

         THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES THAT IT WILL COMPLY WITH THE
FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS.

         SECTION 2.6.      MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN DEBENTURES. In
case any Debenture shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the
Company shall execute, and upon its written request the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, a new Debenture bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Debenture, or in
lieu of and in substitution for the Debenture so destroyed, lost or stolen. In
every case the applicant for a substituted Debenture shall

                                       8

<PAGE>

furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be
required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of
destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and
the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of
such Debenture and of the ownership thereof.

         The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Debenture and deliver
the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the
Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debenture, the Company may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected
therewith. In case any Debenture which has matured or is about to mature or has
been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost
or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Debenture, pay or
authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case
of a mutilated Debenture) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the
Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to
save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence
satisfactory to the Company and to the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft
of such Debenture and of the ownership thereof.

         Every substituted Debenture issued pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.6 by virtue of the fact that any such Debenture is destroyed, lost or
stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall be found at any
time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Debentures duly issued hereunder. All
Debentures shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Debentures and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary
with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other
securities without their surrender.

         SECTION 2.7.      TEMPORARY DEBENTURES. Pending the preparation of
definitive Debentures, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and make available for delivery temporary Debentures that are
typed, printed or lithographed. Temporary Debentures shall be issuable in any
authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive
Debentures in lieu of which they are issued but with such omissions, insertions
and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Debentures, all as may be
determined by the Company. Every such temporary Debenture shall be executed by
the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in
substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive
Debentures. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to
the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent definitive Debentures and thereupon any
or all temporary Debentures may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the
principal corporate trust office of the Trustee or at any office or agency
maintained by the Company for such purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the
Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and make available for
delivery in exchange for such temporary Debentures a like aggregate principal
amount of such definitive Debentures. Such exchange shall be made by the Company
at its own expense and without any charge therefor except that in case of any
such exchange involving a registration of transfer the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto. Until so exchanged, the temporary
Debentures shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Debentures authenticated and delivered hereunder.

         SECTION 2.8.      PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND ADDITIONAL INTEREST. Interest
at the Interest Rate and any Additional Interest on any Debenture that is
payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date for Debentures shall be paid to the Person in whose name said Debenture (or

                                       9

<PAGE>

one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on
the regular record date for such interest installment except that interest and
any Additional Interest payable on the Maturity Date shall be paid to the Person
to whom principal is paid. In the event that any Debenture or portion thereof is
called for redemption and the redemption date is subsequent to a regular record
date with respect to any Interest Payment Date and prior to such Interest
Payment Date, interest on such Debenture will be paid upon presentation and
surrender of such Debenture.

         Each Debenture shall bear interest for the period beginning on (and
including) the date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) March 26,
2003 at a rate per annum of 4.46%, and shall bear interest for each successive
period beginning on (and including) March 26, 2003, and each succeeding Interest
Payment Date, and ending on (but excluding) the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date (each, a "Distribution Period") at a rate per annum equal to the 3-Month
LIBOR, determined as described in Section 2.10, plus 3.05% (the "Coupon Rate");
provided, however, that prior to December 26, 2007, the Coupon Rate shall not
exceed 11.75%, applied to the principal amount thereof, until the principal
thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and to the extent
that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law (without
duplication) on any overdue installment of interest at the Interest Rate
compounded quarterly. Interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date with the first installment of interest to be paid on March
26, 2003.

         Any interest on any Debenture, including Additional Interest, that is
payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest
Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the registered holder on the relevant regular record date by virtue
of having been such holder; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the
Company to the Persons in whose names such Debentures (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special
record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in
the following manner: the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing at least
25 days prior to the date of the proposed payment of the amount of Defaulted
Interest proposed to be paid on each such Debenture and the date of the proposed
payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an
amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of
such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such
Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a
special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not
be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment
and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special
record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause
notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record
date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder
at its address as it appears in the Debenture Register, not less than 10 days
prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as
aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names
such Debentures (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on
such special record date and shall be no longer payable.

         The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any
Debentures in any other lawful manner after notice given by the Company to the
Trustee of the proposed payment method; provided, however, the Trustee in its
sole discretion deems such payment method to be practical.

         The term "regular record date" as used in this Section shall mean the
close of business on the 15th day next preceding the applicable Interest Payment
Date.

                                       10

<PAGE>

         Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debenture
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Debenture shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Debenture.

         SECTION 2.9.      CANCELLATION OF DEBENTURES PAID, ETC. All Debentures
surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of
transfer, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, be
surrendered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to
the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent, shall be promptly canceled by it, and
no Debentures shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by
any of the provisions of this Indenture. All Debentures canceled by any
Authenticating Agent shall be delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee shall
destroy all canceled Debentures unless the Company otherwise directs the Trustee
in writing. If the Company shall acquire any of the Debentures, however, such
acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the
indebtedness represented by such Debentures unless and until the same are
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.

         SECTION 2.10.     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST RATE. The amount of interest
payable for the Distribution Period commencing on March 26, 2003 and each
succeeding Distribution Period will be calculated by applying the Interest Rate
to the principal amount outstanding at the commencement of the Distribution
Period and multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the
Distribution Period concerned divided by 360. In the event that any date on
which interest is payable on the Debentures is not a Business Day, then payment
of interest payable on such date shall be made on the next succeeding day which
is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any
such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date such
payment was originally payable. All percentages resulting from any calculations
on the Debentures will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to
9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such
calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being
rounded upward)).

         (a)      "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered interest
rate for three-month, U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Trustee in the
following order of priority:

                  (1)      the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
         U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that appears on
         Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
         Determination Date (as defined below). "Telerate Page 3750" means the
         display designated as "Page 3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service or
         such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service or such other
         service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers'
         Association as the information vendor for the purpose of displaying
         London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits;

                  (2)      if such rate cannot be identified on the related
         Determination Date, the Trustee will request the principal London
         offices of four leading banks in the London interbank market to provide
         such banks' offered quotations (expressed as percentages per annum) to
         prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S. dollar deposits
         having a three-month maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
         Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, 3-Month
         LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations;

                  (3)      if fewer than two such quotations are provided as
         requested in clause (2) above, the Trustee will request four major New
         York City banks to provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as
         percentages per annum) to leading European banks for loans in U.S.

                                       11

         dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination Date. If
         at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the
         arithmetic mean of such quotations; and

                  (4)      if fewer than two such quotations are provided as
         requested in clause (3) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month LIBOR
         determined with respect to the Distribution Period immediately
         preceding such current Distribution Period.

         If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that
initially appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
related Determination Date is superseded on the Telerate Page 3750 by a
corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such Determination Date, then the
corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable page will be the applicable
3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.

         (b)      The Coupon Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be
higher than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be
modified by United States law.

         (c)      "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking
Days (i.e., a business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the particular Distribution
Period for which a Coupon Rate is being determined.

         (d)      The Trustee shall notify the Company and any securities
exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Debentures are listed, of
the Coupon Rate and the Determination Date for each Distribution Period, in each
case as soon as practicable after the determination thereof but in no event
later than the thirtieth (30th) day of the relevant Distribution Period. Failure
to notify the Company or any securities exchange or interdealer quotation
system, or any defect in said notice, shall not affect the obligation of the
Company to make payment on the Debentures at the applicable Coupon Rate. Any
error in the calculation of the Coupon Rate by the Trustee may be corrected at
any time by notice delivered as above provided. Upon the request of a holder of
a Debenture, the Trustee shall provide the Coupon Rate then in effect and, if
determined, the Coupon Rate for the next Distribution Period.

         (e)      Subject to the corrective rights set forth above, all
certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations
and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the
provisions relating to the payment and calculation of interest on the Debentures
by the Trustee will (in the absence of willful default, bad faith and manifest
error) be final, conclusive and binding on the Trust, the Company and all of the
holders of the Debentures, and no liability shall (in the absence of willful
default, bad faith or manifest error) attach to the Trustee in connection with
the exercise or non-exercise by either of them or their respective powers,
duties and discretion.

         SECTION 2.11.     CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the Debentures
may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee
shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to
Securityholders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed
on the Debentures or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Debentures, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or
omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in
writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

         SECTION 2.12.     REGULATION S COMPLIANCE.

         (a)      Notwithstanding anything in this Article II to the contrary
all Debentures issued on or before the expiration of the Distribution Compliance
Period will be in the form of a temporary Debenture ("Temporary Debentures") and
will contain the following additional legend:

                                       12

<PAGE>

         THIS DEBENTURE IS A TEMPORARY DEBENTURE FOR PURPOSES OF REGULATION S
         UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (AS DEFINED BELOW). NEITHER THIS TEMPORARY
         DEBENTURE NOR ANY INTEREST HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD OR DELIVERED,
         EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE INDENTURE REFERRED TO BELOW. NO
         BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF THIS TEMPORARY DEBENTURE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
         RECEIVE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HEREON UNLESS THE REQUIRED
         CERTIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE
         INDENTURE.

         Holders of a beneficial interest in Debentures sold in reliance on
Regulation S are prohibited from receiving distributions or from exchanging
beneficial interests in Temporary Debentures for a beneficial interest in a
Permanent Debenture until the later of (i) the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period (the "Release Date") and (ii) the furnishing of a certificate,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, certifying that the
beneficial owner of the Temporary Debenture is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in
Section 902 of Regulation S (a "Regulation S Certificate").

         (b)      Any interest in a Debenture evidenced by a Temporary Debenture
is exchangeable for an interest in a Debenture, authenticated and delivered in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, without the legend
referenced in Section 2.12(a) (the "Permanent Debenture") upon the later of (i)
the Release Date and (ii) the furnishing of a Regulation S Certificate.

         (c)      On or prior to the Release Date, each holder of a Temporary
Debenture shall deliver to the Trustee a Regulation S Certificate; provided,
however, that any holder of a Temporary Debenture on the Release Date that has
previously delivered a Regulation S Certificate hereunder shall not be required
to deliver any subsequent Regulation S Certificate (unless the certificate
previously delivered is no longer true as of such subsequent date, in which case
such holder shall promptly notify the Trustee thereof and shall deliver an
updated Regulation S Certificate). No Securityholder shall be entitled to
receive an interest in a Permanent Debenture or any payment of principal of or
interest on or any other payment with respect to its beneficial interest in a
Temporary Debenture prior to the Trustee receiving such Regulation S
Certificate.

         (d)      Any payments of principal of, interest on or any other payment
on a Temporary Debenture received by the Trustee with respect to any Debenture
owned by a Securityholder that has not delivered the Regulation S Certificate
required by this Section 2.12 shall be held by the Trustee. The Trustee shall
remit such payments to the applicable Securityholder only after the Trustee has
received the requisite Regulation S Certificate, at which time the Trustee shall
forward such payments to the Securityholder that is entitled thereto on its
records.

         (e)      Each Securityholder shall exchange its interest in a Temporary
Debenture for an interest in a Permanent Debenture on or after the Release Date
upon furnishing to the Trustee the Regulation S Certificate pursuant to the
terms of this Section 2.12. On and after the Release Date, upon receipt by the
Trustee of any Regulation S Certificate described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company shall execute and, upon receipt of an order to
authenticate, the Authentication Agent shall authenticate and deliver the
Permanent Debenture; provided, however, that a Permanent Debenture may have been
previously executed by the Company and an order to authenticate specifying the
date on which authentication is to take place may have been delivered by the
Company to the Trustee prior to the Release Date.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                       PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

         SECTION 3.1.      PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST; AGREED
TREATMENT OF THE DEBENTURES.

         (a)      The Company covenants and agrees that it will duly and
punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest and any Additional Interest on the Debentures at the place, at the
respective times and in the manner provided in this Indenture and the
Debentures. Each installment of interest on the Debentures may be paid (i) by
mailing checks for such interest payable to the order of the holder of
Debentures entitled thereto as they appear on the registry books of the Company
if a request for a wire transfer has not been received by the Company or (ii) by
wire transfer to any account with a banking institution located in the United
States designated in writing by such Person to the paying agent no later than
the related record date.

         (b)      The Company will treat the Debentures as indebtedness, and the
amounts payable in respect of the principal amount of such Debentures as
interest, for all United States federal income tax purposes. All payments in
respect of such Debentures will be made free and clear of United States
withholding tax to any beneficial owner thereof that has provided an Internal
Revenue Service Form W8 BEN (or any substitute or successor form) establishing
its non-United States status for United States federal income tax purposes.

         SECTION 3.2.      OFFICES FOR NOTICES AND PAYMENTS, ETC. So long as any
of the Debentures remain outstanding, the Company will maintain in Hartford,
Connecticut, an office or agency where the Debentures may be presented for
payment, an office or agency where the Debentures may be presented for
registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and an
office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Debentures or of this Indenture may be served. The Company will give to the
Trustee written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any
change of location thereof. Until otherwise designated from time to time by the
Company in a notice to the Trustee, or specified as contemplated by Section 2.5,
such office or agency for all of the above purposes shall be the office or
agency of the Trustee. In case the Company shall fail to maintain any such
office or agency in Hartford, Connecticut, or shall fail to give such notice of
the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands
may be made and notices may be served at the Principal Office of the Trustee.

         In addition to any such office or agency, the Company may from time to
time designate one or more offices or agencies outside Hartford, Connecticut,
where the Debentures may be presented for registration of transfer and for
exchange in the manner provided in this Indenture, and the Company may from time
to time rescind such designation, as the Company may deem desirable or
expedient; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain any such office or
agency in Hartford, Connecticut, for the purposes above mentioned. The Company
will give to the Trustee prompt written notice of any such designation or
rescission thereof.

         SECTION 3.3.      APPOINTMENTS TO FILL VACANCIES IN TRUSTEE'S OFFICE.
The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 6.9, a Trustee, so that
there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.

         SECTION 3.4.      PROVISION AS TO PAYING AGENT.

         (a)      If the Company shall appoint a paying agent other than the
Trustee, it will cause such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee
an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the
provision of this Section 3.4,

                                       14

<PAGE>

                  (1)      that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent
         for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest,
         if any, on the Debentures (whether such sums have been paid to it by
         the Company or by any other obligor on the Debentures) in trust for the
         benefit of the holders of the Debentures;

                  (2)      that it will give the Trustee prompt written notice
         of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the
         Debentures) to make any payment of the principal of and premium, if
         any, or interest, if any, on the Debentures when the same shall be due
         and payable; and

                  (3)      that it will, at any time during the continuance of
         any Event of Default, upon the written request of the Trustee,
         forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying
         agent.

         (b)      If the Company shall act as its own paying agent, it will, on
or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if
any, on the Debentures, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit
of the holders of the Debentures a sum sufficient to pay such principal, premium
or interest so becoming due and will notify the Trustee in writing of any
failure to take such action and of any failure by the Company (or by any other
obligor under the Debentures) to make any payment of the principal of and
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Debentures when the same shall
become due and payable.

         Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents for the
Debentures, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of and
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Debentures, deposit with a paying
agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium or interest so becoming
due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly
notify the Trustee in writing of its action or failure to act.

         (c)      Anything in this Section 3.4 to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Company may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and
discharge with respect to the Debentures, or for any other reason, pay, or
direct any paying agent to pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the
Company or any such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
trusts herein contained.

         (d)      Anything in this Section 3.4 to the contrary notwithstanding,
the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section 3.4 is subject
to Sections 12.3 and 12.4.

         SECTION 3.5.      CERTIFICATE TO TRUSTEE. The Company will deliver to
the Trustee on or before 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, so long as
Debentures are outstanding hereunder, a Certificate stating that in the course
of the performance by the signers of their duties as officers of the Company
they would normally have knowledge of any default during such fiscal year by the
Company in the performance of any covenants contained herein, stating whether or
not they have knowledge of any such default and, if so, specifying each such
default of which the signers have knowledge and the nature and status thereof.

         SECTION 3.6.      COMPLIANCE WITH CONSOLIDATION PROVISIONS. The Company
will not, while any of the Debentures remain outstanding, consolidate with, or
merge into, or merge into itself, or sell or convey all or substantially all of
its property to any other Person unless the provisions of Article XI hereof are
complied with.

         SECTION 3.7.      LIMITATION ON DIVIDENDS. If there shall have occurred
and be continuing an Event of Default, then the Company shall not, and shall not
allow any Affiliate of the Company to, (x) declare or pay any dividends or
distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation

                                       15

<PAGE>

payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or its Affiliates'
capital stock (other than payments of dividends or distributions to the Company)
or make any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing or (y) make any
payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase
or redeem any debt securities of the Company or any Affiliate that rank pari
passu in all respects with or junior in interest to the Debentures (other than,
with respect to clauses (x) and (y) above, (1) repurchases, redemptions or other
acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any
employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the
benefit of one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in
connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in
connection with the issuance of capital stock of the Company (or securities
convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an
acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Default, (2) as a
result of any exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's
capital stock (or any capital stock of a subsidiary of the Company) for any
class or series of the Company's capital stock or of any class or series of the
Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's capital stock,
(3) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital
stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or
the security being converted or exchanged, (4) any declaration of a dividend in
connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock
or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or
repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, or (5) any dividend in the form of stock,
warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable
upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as
that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to
such stock and any cash payments in lieu of fractional shares issued in
connection therewith.)

                                  ARTICLE IV.
                       SECURITYHOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS
                         BY THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE

         SECTION 4.1.      SECURITYHOLDERS' LISTS. The Company covenants and
agrees that it will furnish or caused to be furnished to the Trustee:

         (a)      on each regular record date for the Debentures, a list, in
such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of
the Securityholders of the Debentures as of such record date; and

         (b)      at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing,
within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of
similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time
such list is furnished;

except that no such lists need be furnished under this Section 4.1 so long as
the Trustee is in possession thereof by reason of its acting as Debenture
registrar.

         SECTION 4.2.      PRESERVATION AND DISCLOSURE OF LISTS.

         (a)      The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the
holders of Debentures (1) contained in the most recent list furnished to it as
provided in Section 4.1 or (2) received by it in the capacity of Debentures
registrar (if so acting) hereunder. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished
to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

         (b)      In case three or more holders of Debentures (hereinafter
referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee and furnish to the
Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Debenture for a
period of at least 6 months preceding the date of such application, and such
application

                                       16

<PAGE>

states that the applicants desire to communicate with other holders of
Debentures with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such
Debentures and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other
communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall
within 5 Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election,
either:

                  (1)      afford such applicants access to the information
         preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions
         of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, or

                  (2)      inform such applicants as to the approximate number
         of holders of Debentures whose names and addresses appear in the
         information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the
         provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, and as to the
         approximate cost of mailing to such Securityholders the form of proxy
         or other communication, if any, specified in such application.

         If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such
information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants,
mail to each Securityholder whose name and address appear in the information
preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (a) of this Section 4.2 a copy of the form of proxy or other
communication which is specified in such request with reasonable promptness
after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or
provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within
five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if permitted or required by
applicable law, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written
statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would
be contrary to the best interests of the holders of all Debentures, as the case
may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall
specify the basis of such opinion. If said Commission, as permitted or required
by applicable law, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified
in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any
of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of
such objections, said Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an
order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such
Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the
renewal of such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any
obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.

         (c)      Each and every holder of Debentures, by receiving and holding
the same, agrees with Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the
Trustee nor any paying agent shall be held accountable by reason of the
disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the holders
of Debentures in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this
Section 4.2, regardless of the source from which such information was derived,
and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any
material pursuant to a request made under said subsection (b).

                                   ARTICLE V.
                   REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND SECURITYHOLDERS
                            UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

         SECTION 5.1.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT. "Event of Default," wherever used
herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected
by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

         (a)      a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the
premises shall have been entered adjudging the Company bankrupt or insolvent, or
approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, readjustment,
arrangement, composition or similar relief for the Company under the

                                       17

<PAGE>

Bankruptcy Law, or any other similar applicable law of any governmental unit,
domestic or foreign, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged
or unstayed for a period of 90 days; or a decree or order or other decision of a
court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for
the appointment of any Person to act as a receiver or liquidator or trustee or
assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or of a substantial part of
its property, or for the involuntary winding up or liquidation of its affairs,
shall have been entered and such decree or order shall have remained in force
undischarged and unstayed for a period of 90 days; or, under the provisions of
any insolvency, bankruptcy, or other law for the relief or aid of creditors, any
court, or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises
shall assume custody or control of the Company or of a substantial part of its
property, and such custody and control shall not be terminated or stayed within
90 days from the date of assumption of such custody or control; or any
substantial part of the property of the Company shall be sequestered or attached
and shall not be returned to the possession of the Company or released from such
attachment within 90 days thereafter; or

         (b)      the Company shall institute proceedings to be adjudicated a
voluntary bankrupt, or shall consent to the filing of a bankruptcy proceeding
against it, or shall file a petition or answer or consent seeking
reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or similar relief under
the Federal bankruptcy laws, or any other similar applicable law of any
governmental unit, domestic or foreign, or shall consent to the filing of any
such petition or shall consent to the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or
trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of it or of a substantial part
of its property, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, or if corporate action shall be taken by the Company in furtherance of any
of the aforesaid purposes.

         SECTION 5.2.      ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Debentures,
then, and in each and every such case, unless the principal of the Debentures
shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of
not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then
outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee
if given by Securityholders), may declare the entire principal of the Debentures
and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and
upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable,
subject to the receipt by the Company of prior approval from the Federal Reserve
(if the Company is a bank holding company) or the OTS (if the Company is a
savings and loan holding company) for payment of such amounts, if then required
under applicable capital guidelines, regulations or policies of the Federal
Reserve or the OTS. Upon payment of such amounts, all obligations of the Company
in respect of the payment of principal of and interest on the Debentures shall
terminate.

         The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that
if, at any time after the principal of the Debentures shall have been so
declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of
the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the
Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all
matured installments of interest upon all the Debentures and the principal of
and premium, if any, on the Debentures which shall have become due otherwise
than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and
Additional Interest) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable
compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective
agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other amounts due to the Trustee pursuant
to Section 6.6, and if any and all Defaults under this Indenture, other than the
non-payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on Debentures which shall
have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise
remedied as provided herein, then and in every such case the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding, by
written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults and
rescind and

                                       18

<PAGE>

annul such declaration and its consequences, but no such waiver or rescission
and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall
impair any right consequent thereon.

         No such rescission and waiver shall affect any subsequent default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

         In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under
this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned
because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have
been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the
Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures shall be restored
respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights,
remedies and powers of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the
Debentures shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

         SECTION 5.3.      DEFAULTS. "Default," wherever used herein, means any
one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Default and whether it
shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law pursuant to
any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of
any administrative or governmental body):

         (a)      an Event of Default has occurred;

         (b)      the Company fails to pay the principal of any Debenture at the
Maturity Date and such failure is continued for six days, whether or not such
payment is prohibited by Article XV hereof; or

         (c)      the Company fails to pay any installment of interest on an
Interest Payment Date and such failure is continued for 30 days, whether or not
such payment is prohibited by Article XV hereof.

         The Company covenants that, if a Default shall occur, it will, upon
demand of the Trustee and subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve (if the
Company is a bank holding company) or the OTS (if the Company is a savings and
loan holding company), if then required, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of
the Securityholders, the entire amount then due and payable on the Debentures
(x) in the case of a Default specified in clause (a) or (b) above, for the
principal and interest, if any, and interest upon the overdue principal and, to
the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon
overdue installments of interest, at the Interest Rate, and (y) in the case of a
Default specified in clause (c) above, for the interest and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments
of interest, at the Interest Rate; and in each case, in addition thereto, such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

         If the Company fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand and
if the necessary Federal Reserve or OTS approval, if any, has been obtained, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon the Debentures, and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of
the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Debentures wherever
situated.

         If a Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Securityholders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall
deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the
specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of
the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

                                       19

         SECTION 5.4.      TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOF OF CLAIMS. In case there shall
be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the
Company or any other obligor on the Debentures under Bankruptcy Law, or in case
a receiver or trustee shall have been appointed for the property of the Company
or such other obligor, or in the case of any other similar judicial proceedings
relative to the Company or other obligor upon the Debentures, or to the
creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee,
irrespective of whether the principal of the Debentures shall then be due and
payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 5.4, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention
in such proceedings or otherwise,

         (i)      to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Debentures and, in
case of any judicial proceedings,

         (ii)     to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
(including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for
reimbursement of all other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6), and of
the Securityholders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company
or any other obligor on the Debentures, or to the creditors or property of the
Company or such other obligor, unless prohibited by applicable law and
regulations, to vote on behalf of the holders of the Debentures in any election
of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or
other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or Person performing similar
functions in comparable proceedings,

         (iii)    to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims, and

         (iv)     to distribute the same after the deduction of its charges and
expenses.

         Any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is
hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make such payments to the
Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as
shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each
predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all
other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6.

         Nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Debentures or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

         All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or
under any of the Debentures, may be enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Debentures, or the production thereof at any trial or
other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by
the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and
any recovery of judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the
Debentures.

         In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings
involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Trustee shall be a party), the Trustee shall be held to represent all the
holders of the Debentures, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of
the Debentures parties to any such proceedings.

         SECTION 5.5.      APPLICATION OF MONEYS COLLECTED BY TRUSTEE. Any
moneys collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V shall be applied in
the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the

                                       20

<PAGE>

Trustee for the distribution of such moneys, upon presentation of the several
Debentures in respect of which moneys have been collected, and stamping thereon
the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

         First: To the payment of costs and expenses incurred by, and reasonable
fees of, the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and of all other
amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6;

         Second: To the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company if and
to the extent required by Article XV;

         Third: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon
Debentures for principal (and premium, if any), and interest on the Debentures,
in respect of which or for the benefit of which money has been collected,
ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts
due on such Debentures for principal (and premium, if any) and interest,
respectively; and

         Fourth: The balance, if any, to the Company.

         SECTION 5.6.      PROCEEDINGS BY SECURITYHOLDERS. No holder of any
Debenture shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding for
any remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the
Trustee written notice of a Default with respect to the Debentures and unless
the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures
then outstanding shall have given the Trustee a written request to institute
such action, suit or proceeding and shall have offered to the Trustee such
reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after its
receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to
institute any such action, suit or proceeding.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, however, the
right of any holder of any Debenture to receive payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest, on such Debenture when due, or to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, shall not be impaired or affected
without the consent of such holder and by accepting a Debenture hereunder it is
expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every
Debenture with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or
more holders of Debentures shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by
virtue or by availing itself of any provision of this Indenture to affect,
disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other Debentures, or to
obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder,
or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of
Debentures. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this
Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such
relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

         SECTION 5.7.      PROCEEDINGS BY TRUSTEE. In case of a Default
hereunder the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the
rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings
as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such
rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in
bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right
vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

         SECTION 5.8.      REMEDIES CUMULATIVE AND CONTINUING; DELAY OR OMISSION
NOT A WAIVER. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6, all powers and
remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Securityholders shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any
other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the
Debentures, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or
observance of the covenants and

                                       21

<PAGE>

agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to
the Debentures, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any
of the Debentures to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default
occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or
shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence
therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.6, every power and remedy
given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders may
be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by
the Trustee or by the Securityholders.

         No delay or omission of the Trustee or any Securityholder to exercise
any right or remedy accruing upon any Default shall impair any such right or
remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to any
Securityholder may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Trustee (in accordance with its duties under Section 6.1
hereof) or by such holder, as the case may be.

         SECTION 5.9.      DIRECTION OF PROCEEDINGS AND WAIVER OF DEFAULTS BY
MAJORITY OF SECURITYHOLDERS. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Debentures affected (voting as one class) at the time outstanding
shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such Debentures; provided,
however, that (subject to the provisions of Section 6.1) the Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee shall determine
that the action so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the holders not
taking part in such direction or if the Trustee being advised by counsel
determines that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken
or if a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall determine that the action or
proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

         The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures at the time outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the
Debentures waive (or modify any previously granted waiver of) any past default,
and its consequences, except a default (a) in the payment of principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on any of the Debentures or (b) in respect of
covenants or provisions hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the holder of each Debenture affected. Upon any such waiver, the
default covered thereby shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this
Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures shall
be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon. Whenever any default hereunder shall have been waived as
permitted by this Section, said default shall for all purposes of the Debentures
and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing. The
term "default" for the purpose of this Section 5.9 and Section 5.10 is defined
to be the events specified in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3, not including periods
of grace, if any, provided for therein.

         SECTION 5.10.     NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. The Trustee shall, within 90 days
after the actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of the
occurrence of a default with respect to the Debentures, mail to all
Securityholders, as the names and addresses of such holders appear upon the
Debenture Register, notice of all defaults with respect to the Debentures known
to the Trustee, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of
such notice; provided, however, that, except in the case of default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the
Debentures, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so
long as a Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith determines that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders.

         SECTION 5.11.     UNDERTAKING TO PAY COSTS. All parties to this
Indenture agree, and each holder of any Debenture by his acceptance thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its

                                       22

<PAGE>

discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or
omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the
merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall not apply to
any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any
Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding in the aggregate more than
10% in principal amount of the Debentures outstanding, or to any suit instituted
by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or
premium, if any) or interest on any Debenture against the Company on or after
the same shall have become due and payable.

                                  ARTICLE VI.
                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

         SECTION 6.1.      DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRUSTEE. With respect
to the holders of Debentures issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the
occurrence of a Default with respect to the Debentures and after the curing or
waiving of all Defaults which may have occurred, with respect to the Debentures,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee. In case a Default with respect to the Debentures
has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same
degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or
use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

         No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

         (a)      prior to the occurrence of a Default with respect to
Debentures and after the curing or waiving of all Defaults which may have
occurred

                  (1)      the duties and obligations of the Trustee with
         respect to Debentures shall be determined solely by the express
         provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable
         except for the performance of such duties and obligations with respect
         to the Debentures as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and
         no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture
         against the Trustee, and

                  (2)      in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
         Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
         statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
         any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to
         the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such
         certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically
         required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a
         duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to
         the requirements of this Indenture;

         (b)      the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless it
shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts; and

         (c)      the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in accordance with the
direction of the Securityholders pursuant to Section 5.7, relating to the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this
Indenture.

                                       23

<PAGE>

         None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers, if there is ground for believing that the repayment of
such funds or liability is not assured to it under the terms of this Indenture
or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against such risk is not reasonably
assured to it.

         SECTION 6.2.      RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS, OPINIONS, ETC. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.1:

         (a)      the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected
in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, note,
debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

         (b)      any request, direction, order or demand of the Company
mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed);
and any Board Resolution may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof
certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;

         (c)      the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and any
advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

         (d)      the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or
direction of any of the Securityholders, pursuant to the provisions of this
Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee
reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred therein or thereby;

         (e)      the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the
discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; nothing
contained herein shall, however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the
occurrence of a Default with respect to the Debentures (that has not been cured
or waived) to exercise with respect to Debentures such of the rights and powers
vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in
their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances
in the conduct of his own affairs;

         (f)      the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond,
debenture, coupon or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do
so by the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Debentures affected thereby; provided, however, that if the
payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is,
in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such expense or liability as a condition to so
proceeding;

         (g)      the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder
or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents
(including any Authenticating Agent) or attorneys, and the Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or
attorney appointed by it with due care; and

                                       24

<PAGE>

         (h)      with the exceptions of Defaults under Sections 5.3(b) or
5.3(c), the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default with
respect to the Debentures unless a written notice of such Default shall have
been given to the Trustee by the Company or any other obligor on the Debentures
or by any holder of the Debentures.

         SECTION 6.3.      NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECITALS, ETC. The recitals
contained herein and in the Debentures (except in the certificate of
authentication of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent) shall be taken as the
statements of the Company, and the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent assume
no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee and the
Authenticating Agent make no representations as to the validity or sufficiency
of this Indenture or of the Debentures. The Trustee and the Authenticating Agent
shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any
Debentures or the proceeds of any Debentures authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee or the Authenticating Agent in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture.

         SECTION 6.4.      TRUSTEE, AUTHENTICATING AGENT, PAYING AGENTS,
TRANSFER AGENTS OR REGISTRAR MAY OWN DEBENTURES. The Trustee or any
Authenticating Agent or any paying agent or any transfer agent or any Debenture
registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or
pledgee of Debentures with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee,
Authenticating Agent, paying agent, transfer agent or Debenture registrar.

         SECTION 6.5.      MONEYS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. Subject to the provisions
of Section 12.4, all moneys received by the Trustee or any paying agent shall,
until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purpose for
which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by law. The Trustee and any paying agent shall be under no
liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise
agreed in writing with the Company. So long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, all interest allowed on any such moneys shall be
paid from time to time upon the written order of the Company, signed by the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President,
a Managing Director, a Vice President, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer
of the Company.

         SECTION 6.6.      COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES OF TRUSTEE. The Company
covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee
in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the
reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of
all Persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement
or advance as may arise from its negligence or willful misconduct. For purposes
of clarification, this Section 6.6 does not contemplate the payment by the
Company of acceptance or annual administration fees owing to the Trustee
pursuant to the services to be provided by the Trustee under this Indenture or
the fees and expenses of the Trustee's counsel in connection with the closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Indenture. The Company also covenants to
indemnify each of the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee (and its officers,
agents, directors and employees) for, and to hold it harmless against, any and
all loss, damage, claim, liability or expense including taxes (other than taxes
based on the income of the Trustee) incurred without negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Trustee and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses
of defending itself against any claim of liability. The obligations of the
Company under this Section 6.6 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to
pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall
constitute additional indebtedness hereunder. Such additional indebtedness shall
be secured by a lien prior to that of the Debentures upon all property and funds
held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the
benefit of the holders of particular Debentures.

                                       25

<PAGE>

         Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under
applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in
connection with a Default, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and
expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to
constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.

         The provisions of this Section shall survive the resignation or removal
of the Trustee and the defeasance or other termination of this Indenture.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or any Debenture to the
contrary, the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to advance funds to
pay any principal of or interest on or other amounts with respect to the
Debentures or otherwise advance funds to or on behalf of the Company.

         SECTION 6.7.      OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AS EVIDENCE. Except as
otherwise provided in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, whenever in the administration of
the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or
desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or omitting any
action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such
certificate, in the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken or
omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

         SECTION 6.8.      ELIGIBILITY OF TRUSTEE. The Trustee hereunder shall
at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the
United States of America or any state or territory thereof or of the District of
Columbia or a corporation or other Person authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers, having (or whose obligations under this Indenture are
guaranteed by an affiliate having) a combined capital and surplus of at least 50
million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000.00) and subject to supervision or examination
by federal, state, territorial, or District of Columbia authority. If such
corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or
to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section 6.8 the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent records of condition so published.

         The Company may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as
Trustee.

         In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.8, the Trustee shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.9.

         If the Trustee has or shall acquire any "conflicting interest" within
the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Trustee
shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner
described by this Indenture.

         SECTION 6.9.      RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE

         (a)      The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed,
may at any time resign by giving written notice of such resignation to the
Company and by mailing notice thereof, at the Company's expense, to the holders
of the Debentures at their addresses as they shall appear on the Debenture
Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly
appoint a successor trustee or trustees by written instrument, in duplicate,
executed by order of its Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall
be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor

                                       26

<PAGE>

Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted
appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation to
the affected Securityholders, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, or any
Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Debenture or Debentures for
at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.11, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the
appointment of a successor Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice,
if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.

         (b)      In case at any time any of the following shall occur --

                  (1)      the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions
         of Section 6.8 after written request therefor by the Company or by any
         Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Debenture or
         Debentures for at least 6 months, or

                  (2)      the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
         with the provisions of Section 6.8 and shall fail to resign after
         written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder,
         or

                  (3)      the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or
         shall be adjudged as bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
         Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer
         shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or
         affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

         then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and appoint
         a successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by
         order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be
         delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor
         Trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 5.11, any
         Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Debenture or
         Debentures for at least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and all
         others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction
         for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor
         Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may
         deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint successor
         Trustee.

         (c)      Upon prior written notice to the Company and the Trustee, the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the
time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor
Trustee, which shall be deemed appointed as successor Trustee unless within 10
Business Days after such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case,
or in the case of a failure by such holders to nominate a successor Trustee, the
Trustee so removed or any Securityholder, upon the terms and conditions and
otherwise as in subsection (a) of this Section 6.9 provided, may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor.

         (d)      Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in
Section 6.10.

         SECTION 6.10.     ACCEPTANCE BY SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. Any successor
Trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.9 shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the Company and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting
such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights,
powers, duties and obligations with respect to the Debentures of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee herein; but,
nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor Trustee,
the Trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6, execute and

                                       27

<PAGE>

deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights and
powers of the Trustee so ceasing to act and shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring
Trustee thereunder. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company
shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly
vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights and powers.
Any Trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property
or funds held or collected by such Trustee to secure any amounts then due it
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.

         If a successor Trustee is appointed, the Company, the retiring Trustee
and the successor Trustee shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental
hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or
desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the
retiring Trustee with respect to the Debentures as to which the predecessor
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee,
and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust hereunder
by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such
supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same
trust and that each such Trustee shall be Trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder
separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other
such Trustee.

         No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 6.8.

         In no event shall a retiring Trustee be liable for the acts or
omissions of any successor Trustee hereunder.

         Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in
this Section 6.10, the Company shall mail notice of the succession of such
Trustee hereunder to the holders of Debentures at their addresses as they shall
appear on the Debenture Register. If the Company fails to mail such notice
within 10 Business Days after the acceptance of appointment by the successor
Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the
expense of the Company.

         SECTION 6.11.     SUCCESSION BY MERGER, ETC. Any corporation into which
the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the
successor of the Trustee hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper
or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided such
corporation shall be otherwise eligible and qualified under this Article.

         In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the
trusts created by this Indenture any of the Debentures shall have been
authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee, and deliver such
Debentures so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Debentures
shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate
such Debentures either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name
of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the
full force which it is anywhere in the Debentures or in this Indenture provided
that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, however, that the
right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or
authenticate Debentures in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only
to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

         SECTION 6.12.     AUTHENTICATING AGENTS. There may be one or more
Authenticating Agents appointed by the Trustee upon the request of the Company
with power to act on its behalf and subject to its direction in the
authentication and delivery of Debentures issued upon exchange or registration
of transfer thereof as fully to all intents and purposes as though any such
Authenticating Agent had been

                                       28

<PAGE>

expressly authorized to authenticate and deliver Debentures; provided, however,
that the Trustee shall have no liability to the Company for any acts or
omissions of the Authenticating Agent with respect to the authentication and
delivery of Debentures. Any such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or
of any state or territory thereof or of the District of Columbia authorized
under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000.00 and being subject to supervision or
examination by federal, state, territorial or District of Columbia authority. If
such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually pursuant to
law or the requirements of such authority, then for the purposes of this Section
6.12 the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect herein specified in this Section.

         Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor
of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is
otherwise eligible under this Section 6.12 without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such
Authenticating Agent.

         Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written
notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any
time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent with respect to the
Debentures by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a
termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible under this Section 6.12, the Trustee may, and upon the request of the
Company shall, promptly appoint a successor Authenticating Agent eligible under
this Section 6.12, shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company
and shall mail notice of such appointment to all holders of Debentures as the
names and addresses of such holders appear on the Debenture Register. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities with
respect to the Debentures of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if
originally named as Authenticating Agent herein.

         The Company agrees to pay to any Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services. Any Authenticating Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such in accordance
with the directions of the Trustee.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                         CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS

         SECTION 7.1.      ACTION BY SECURITYHOLDERS. Whenever in this Indenture
it is provided that the holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal
amount of the Debentures may take any action (including the making of any demand
or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any
other action) the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of
such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (a) by any
instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such
Securityholders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by
the record of such holders of Debentures voting in favor thereof at any meeting
of such Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions
of Article VIII, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and
any such record of such a meeting of such Securityholders or (d) by any other
method the Trustee deems satisfactory.

                                       29

<PAGE>

         If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders any request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or
revocation of the same, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such Debentures for the
determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record
date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action or revocation of the same may be given before or after
the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business
on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of
determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of outstanding
Debentures have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, and for that purpose the outstanding Debentures shall be computed
as of the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement
or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective
unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture
not later than 6 months after the record date.

         SECTION 7.2.      PROOF OF EXECUTION BY SECURITYHOLDERS. Subject to the
provisions of Section 6.1, 6.2 and 8.5, proof of the execution of any instrument
by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient if made in
accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The
ownership of Debentures shall be proved by the Debenture Register or by a
certificate of the Debenture registrar. The Trustee may require such additional
proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.

         The record of any Securityholders' meeting shall be proved in the
manner provided in Section 8.6.

         SECTION 7.3.      WHO ARE DEEMED ABSOLUTE OWNERS. Prior to due
presentment for registration of transfer of any Debenture, the Company, the
Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any paying agent, any transfer agent and any
Debenture registrar may deem the Person in whose name such Debenture shall be
registered upon the Debenture Register to be, and may treat him as, the absolute
owner of such Debenture (whether or not such Debenture shall be overdue) for the
purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such Debenture and for all other purposes; and neither the
Company nor the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent nor any paying agent nor
any transfer agent nor any Debenture registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the time being or
upon his order shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid,
effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any
such Debenture.

         SECTION 7.4.      DEBENTURES OWNED BY COMPANY DEEMED NOT OUTSTANDING.
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount
of Debentures have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this
Indenture, Debentures which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the
Debentures or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by
or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor
on the Debentures shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the
purpose of any such determination; provided, however, that for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such
direction, consent or waiver, only Debentures which a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Debentures so owned
which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the
purposes of this Section 7.4 if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Trustee the pledgee's right to vote such Debentures and that the pledgee
is not the Company or any such other obligor or Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Company or any such other obligor. In the case of a dispute as

                                       30

<PAGE>

to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel
shall be full protection to the Trustee.

         SECTION 7.5.      REVOCATION OF CONSENTS; FUTURE HOLDERS BOUND. At any
time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in
Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the holders of the percentage in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures specified in this Indenture in
connection with such action, any holder (in cases where no record date has been
set pursuant to Section 7.1) or any holder as of an applicable record date (in
cases where a record date has been set pursuant to Section 7.1) of a Debenture
(or any Debenture issued in whole or in part in exchange or substitution
therefor) the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included in
the Debentures the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing
written notice with the Trustee at the Principal Office of the Trustee and upon
proof of holding as provided in Section 7.2, revoke such action so far as
concerns such Debenture (or so far as concerns the principal amount represented
by any exchanged or substituted Debenture). Except as aforesaid any such action
taken by the holder of any Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such
holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Debenture, and of any
Debenture issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of
transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto
is made upon such Debenture or any Debenture issued in exchange or substitution
therefor.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.
                            SECURITYHOLDERS' MEETINGS

         SECTION 8.1.      PURPOSES OF MEETINGS. A meeting of Securityholders
may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to the provisions of
this Article VIII for any of the following purposes:

         (a)      to give any notice to the Company or to the Trustee, or to
give any directions to the Trustee, or to consent to the waiving of any default
hereunder and its consequences, or to take any other action authorized to be
taken by Securityholders pursuant to any of the provisions of Article V;

         (b)      to remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee
pursuant to the provisions of Article VI;

         (c)      to consent to the execution of an indenture or indentures
supplemental hereto pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.2; or

         (d)      to take any other action authorized to be taken by or on
behalf of the holders of any specified aggregate principal amount of such
Debentures under any other provision of this Indenture or under applicable law.

         SECTION 8.2.      CALL OF MEETINGS BY TRUSTEE. The Trustee may at any
time call a meeting of Securityholders to take any action specified in Section
8.1, to be held at such time and at such place as the Trustee shall determine.
Notice of every meeting of the Securityholders, setting forth the time and the
place of such meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at
such meeting, shall be mailed to holders of Debentures affected at their
addresses as they shall appear on the Debentures Register and, if the Company is
not a holder of Debentures, to the Company. Such notice shall be mailed not less
than 20 nor more than 180 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

         SECTION 8.3.      CALL OF MEETINGS BY COMPANY OR SECURITYHOLDERS. In
case at any time the Company pursuant to a Board Resolution, or the holders of
at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures, as the case may
be, then outstanding, shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of
Securityholders, by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the
action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have
mailed the notice of such meeting within 20 days after receipt of

                                       31

<PAGE>

such request, then the Company or such Securityholders may determine the time
and the place for such meeting and may call such meeting to take any action
authorized in Section 8.1, by mailing notice thereof as provided in Section 8.2.

         SECTION 8.4.      QUALIFICATIONS FOR VOTING. To be entitled to vote at
any meeting of Securityholders a Person shall (a) be a holder of one or more
Debentures with respect to which the meeting is being held or (b) a Person
appointed by an instrument in writing as proxy by a holder of one or more such
Debentures. The only Persons who shall be entitled to be present or to speak at
any meeting of Securityholders shall be the Persons entitled to vote at such
meeting and their counsel and any representatives of the Trustee and its counsel
and any representatives of the Company and its counsel.

         SECTION 8.5.      REGULATIONS. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem
advisable for any meeting of Securityholders, in regard to proof of the holding
of Debentures and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of
proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other
matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall think fit.

         The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary
chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the
Company or by Securityholders as provided in Section 8.3, in which case the
Company or the Securityholders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in
like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent
secretary of the meeting shall be elected by majority vote of the meeting.

         Subject to the provisions of Section 7.4, at any meeting each holder of
Debentures with respect to which such meeting is being held or proxy therefor
shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000.00 principal amount of Debentures
held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or
counted at any meeting in respect of any Debenture challenged as not outstanding
and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not outstanding. The chairman of
the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of Debentures held
by him or instruments in writing as aforesaid duly designating him as the Person
to vote on behalf of other Securityholders. Any meeting of Securityholders duly
called pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2 or 8.3 may be adjourned from
time to time by a majority of those present, whether or not constituting a
quorum, and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

         SECTION 8.6.      VOTING. The vote upon any resolution submitted to any
meeting of holders of Debentures with respect to which such meeting is being
held shall be by written ballots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of
such holders or of their representatives by proxy and the serial number or
numbers of the Debentures held or represented by them. The permanent chairman of
the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast
at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with
the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in triplicate of all
votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the proceedings of each
meeting of Securityholders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and
there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of
votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more Persons
having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting
and showing that said notice was mailed as provided in Section 8.2. The record
shall show the serial numbers of the Debentures voting in favor of or against
any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the
permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the duplicates shall
be delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the
Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting.

         Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the
matters therein stated.

                                       32

<PAGE>

         SECTION 8.7.      QUORUM; ACTIONS. The Persons entitled to vote a
majority in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding shall constitute
a quorum for a meeting of Securityholders; provided, however, that if any action
is to be taken at such meeting with respect to a consent, waiver, request,
demand, notice, authorization, direction or other action which may be given by
the holders of not less than a specified percentage in principal amount of the
Debentures then outstanding, the Persons holding or representing such specified
percentage in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding will
constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes of the time
appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of
Securityholders, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may be adjourned
for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the permanent chairman of
the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum
at any such adjourned meeting, such adjourned meeting may be further adjourned
for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the permanent chairman of
the meeting prior to the adjournment of such adjourned meeting. Notice of the
reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section 8.2,
except that such notice need be given only once not less than 5 days prior to
the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the
reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage, as
provided above, of the principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding which
shall constitute a quorum.

         Except as limited by the provisos in the first paragraph of Section
9.2, any resolution presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened
at which a quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures then
outstanding; provided, however, that, except as limited by the provisos in the
first paragraph of Section 9.2, any resolution with respect to any consent,
waiver, request, demand, notice, authorization, direction or other action which
this Indenture expressly provides may be given by the holders of not less than a
specified percentage in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding may
be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a
quorum is present as aforesaid only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
not less than such specified percentage in principal amount of the Debentures
then outstanding.

         Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of holders of

                             SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

         SECTION 9.1.      SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITHOUT CONSENT OF
SECURITYHOLDERS. The Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the
Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or
indentures supplemental hereto, without the consent of the Securityholders, for
one or more of the following purposes:

         (a)      to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company,
or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor Person of the
covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company, pursuant to Article XI
hereof;

         (b)      to add to the covenants of the Company such further covenants,
restrictions or conditions for the protection of the holders of Debentures as
the Board of Directors shall consider to be for the protection of the holders of
such Debentures, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance,
of a default in any of such additional covenants, restrictions or conditions a
default or an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the
several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided,
however, that in respect of any such additional covenant restriction or
condition such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of

default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of
other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or
may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such default;

         (c)      to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any
provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be
defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any
supplemental indenture, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or
questions arising under this Indenture; provided that any such action shall not
materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Debentures;

         (d)      to add to, delete from, or revise the terms of Debentures,
including, without limitation, any terms relating to the issuance, exchange,
registration or transfer of Debentures (for purposes of assuring that no
registration of Debentures is required under the Securities Act); provided,
however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the
holders of the Debentures then outstanding;

         (e)      to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment
hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures and to add to or
change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide
for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one
Trustee;

         (f)      to make any change (other than as elsewhere provided in this
paragraph) that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder in
any material respect; or

         (g)      to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and
terms and conditions of the Debentures, to establish the form of any
certifications required to be furnished pursuant to the terms of this Indenture
or the Debentures, or to add to the rights of the holders of Debentures.

         The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the
execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate
agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the
conveyance, transfer and assignment of any property thereunder, but the Trustee
shall not be obligated to, but may in its discretion, enter into any such
supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

         Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section
9.1 may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the
holders of any of the Debentures at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of
the provisions of Section 9.2.

         SECTION 9.2.      SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF
SECURITYHOLDERS. With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 7.1) of the
holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures at the time outstanding affected by such supplemental indenture
(voting as a class), the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the
Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or
indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or
of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the
holders of the Debentures; provided, however, that no such supplemental
indenture shall without the consent of the holders of each Debenture then
outstanding and affected thereby (i) change the fixed maturity of any Debenture,
or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount
payable on redemption thereof or make the principal thereof or any interest or
premium thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the
Debentures, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute
suit for payment thereof or impair the right of repayment, if any, at the option
of the holder, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debentures the holders
of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture.

                                       34

<PAGE>

         Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution
authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the
filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders as
aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such
supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which
case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter
into such supplemental indenture.

         Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any
supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee
shall transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, a notice, prepared by the
Company, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental
indenture, to the Securityholders as their names and addresses appear upon the
Debenture Register. Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any
defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of
any such supplemental indenture.

         It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under
this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental
indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof.

         SECTION 9.3.      EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Upon the execution
of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX,
this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance
therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties
and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the holders
of Debentures shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder
subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments and all the terms
and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be
part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

         SECTION 9.4.      NOTATION ON DEBENTURES. Debentures authenticated and
delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX may bear a notation as to any matter provided for
in such supplemental indenture. If the Company or the Trustee shall so
determine, new Debentures so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Board
of Directors of the Company, to any modification of this Indenture contained in
any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company,
authenticated by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent and delivered in
exchange for the Debentures then outstanding.

         SECTION 9.5.      EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE TO
BE FURNISHED TO TRUSTEE. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1
and 6.2, shall, in addition to the documents required by Section 14.6, receive
an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that
any supplemental indenture executed pursuant hereto complies with the
requirements of this Article IX. The Trustee shall receive an Opinion of Counsel
as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this
Article IX is authorized or permitted by, and conforms to, the terms of this
Article IX and that it is proper for the Trustee under the provisions of this
Article IX to join in the execution thereof.

                            REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

         SECTION 10.1.     OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. The Company shall have the right
(subject to the receipt by the Company of prior approval (i) if the Company is a
bank holding company, from the Federal Reserve, if then required under
applicable capital guidelines or policies of the Federal Reserve or (ii) if the
Company is a savings and loan holding company, from the OTS if then required
under applicable capital guidelines or policies of the OTS) to redeem the
Debentures, in whole or in part, but in all cases in

                                       35

<PAGE>

a principal amount with integral multiples of $1,000.00, on any March 26, June
26, September 26 or December 26 on or after December 26, 2007 (the "Redemption
Date") at the Redemption Price.

         SECTION 10.2.     NOTICE OF REDEMPTION; SELECTION OF DEBENTURES. In
case the Company shall desire to exercise the right to redeem all, or, as the
case may be, any part of the Debentures, it shall cause to be mailed a notice of
such redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date to the holders of Debentures so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at
their last addresses as the same appear on the Debenture Register. Such mailing
shall be by first class mail. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided
shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the
holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or
any defect in the notice to the holder of any Debenture designated for
redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any other Debenture.

         Each such notice of redemption shall specify the CUSIP number, if any,
of the Debentures to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price at
which Debentures are to be redeemed, the place or places of payment, that
payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Debentures, that
interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in
said notice, and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions
thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. If less than all the Debentures are
to be redeemed the notice of redemption shall specify the numbers of the
Debentures to be redeemed. In case the Debentures are to be redeemed in part
only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for
redemption, upon surrender of such Debenture, a new Debenture or Debentures in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.

         Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date or
Special Redemption Date, as applicable, the Company will deposit with the
Trustee or with one or more paying agents an amount of money sufficient to
redeem on the Redemption Date or the Special Redemption Date, as applicable, all
the Debentures so called for redemption at the appropriate Redemption Price or
Special Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date
or Special Redemption Date, as applicable.

         If all, or less than all, the Debentures are to be redeemed, the
Company will give the Trustee notice not less than 45 nor more than 60 days,
respectively, prior to the Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date, as
applicable, as to the aggregate principal amount of Debentures to be redeemed
and the Trustee shall select, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall
deem appropriate and fair, the Debentures or portions thereof (in integral
multiples of $1,000.00) to be redeemed.

         SECTION 10.3.     PAYMENT OF DEBENTURES CALLED FOR REDEMPTION. If
notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 10.2, the Debentures
or portions of Debentures with respect to which such notice has been given shall
become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the place or places stated
in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price, together with interest
accrued to the Redemption Date and on and after said date (unless the Company
shall default in the payment of such Debentures at the Redemption Price,
together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Debentures or
portions of Debentures so called for redemption shall cease to accrue. On
presentation and surrender of such Debentures at a place of payment specified in
said notice, such Debentures or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and
redeemed by the Company at the applicable Redemption Price, together with
interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date.

         Upon presentation of any Debenture redeemed in part only, the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery
to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Debenture or
Debentures of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the Debenture so presented.

                CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, CONVEYANCE AND LEASE

         SECTION 11.1.     COMPANY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC., ON CERTAIN TERMS.
Nothing contained in this Indenture or in the Debentures shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other Person (whether or
not affiliated with the Company) or successive consolidations or mergers in
which the Company or its successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or
shall prevent any sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of the
property or capital stock of the Company or its successor or successors as an
entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to any other Person (whether or not
affiliated with the Company, or its successor or successors) authorized to
acquire and operate the same; provided, however, that the Company hereby
covenants and agrees that, upon any such consolidation, merger (where the
Company is not the surviving corporation), sale, conveyance, transfer or other

in form to the Trustee executed and delivered to the Trustee by the entity
formed by such consolidation, or into which the Company shall have been merged,
or by the entity which shall have acquired such property.

         SECTION 11.2.     SUCCESSOR ENTITY TO BE SUBSTITUTED. In case of any

and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on
all of the Debentures and the due and punctual performance and observance of all
of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed or observed by
the Company, such successor entity shall succeed to and be substituted for the
Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company, and
thereupon the predecessor entity shall be relieved of any further liability or
obligation hereunder or upon the Debentures. Such successor entity thereupon may
cause to be signed, and may issue in its own name, any or all of the Debentures
issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company
and delivered to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent; and, upon the order of
such successor entity instead of the Company and subject to all the terms,
conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver any Debentures which
previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company,
to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for authentication, and any
Debentures which such successor entity thereafter shall cause to be signed and
delivered to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for that purpose. All the
Debentures so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this Indenture as the Debentures theretofore or thereafter issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Debentures had
been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

         SECTION 11.3.     OPINION OF COUNSEL TO BE GIVEN TO TRUSTEE. The
Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive, in
addition to the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 9.5, an Opinion of
Counsel as conclusive evidence that any consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
transfer or other disposition, and any assumption, permitted or required by the
terms of this Article XI complies with the provisions of this Article XI.

                  the Trustee, in trust, funds, which shall be immediately due
                  and payable, sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption
                  all of the Debentures (other than any Debentures which shall

                  (2) paid to any state or to the District of Columbia pursuant
                  to its unclaimed property or similar laws,

Indenture shall cease to be of further effect except for the provisions of
Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9 and 12.4 hereof shall
survive until such Debentures shall mature and be paid. Thereafter, Sections 6.6
and 12.4 shall survive, and the Trustee, on demand of the Company accompanied by
an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture have been complied with, and at the cost and expense
of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of
and discharging this Indenture. The Company agrees to reimburse the Trustee for
any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee
in connection with this Indenture or the Debentures.

case with the same force and effect as if made on the original date of payment,
and no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such date.

         SECTION 14.8.     TABLE OF CONTENTS, HEADINGS, ETC. The table of
contents and the titles and headings of the articles and sections of this
Indenture have been inserted for convenience of reference only, are not to be

terms or provisions hereof.

         SECTION 14.9.     EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Indenture may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but
such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

         SECTION 14.10.    SEPARABILITY. In case any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Indenture or in the Debentures shall for any reason
be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Indenture or of such Debentures, but this Indenture and such Debentures shall be
construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein or therein.

         SECTION 14.11.    ASSIGNMENT. The Company will have the right at all
times to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Indenture to a

                           SUBORDINATION OF DEBENTURES

         SECTION 15.1.     AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE. The Company covenants and
agrees, and each holder of Debentures by such Securityholder's acceptance
thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all

                                       40

<PAGE>

Debentures shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article XV; and
each holder of a Debenture, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or
assignment thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.

         The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium, if any,
and interest on all Debentures shall, to the extent and in the manner
hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether
outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.

         No provision of this Article XV shall prevent the occurrence of any
default or Event of Default hereunder.

         SECTION 15.2.     DEFAULT ON SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. In the event and
during the continuation of any default by the Company in the payment of
principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on any Senior Indebtedness
of the Company following any grace period, or in the event that the maturity of
any Senior Indebtedness of the Company has been accelerated because of a default
and such acceleration has not been rescinded or canceled, then, in either case,
no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to the principal (including
redemption) of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Debentures.

         In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be
received by the Trustee when such payment is prohibited by the preceding
paragraph of this Section 15.2, such payment shall, subject to Section 15.7, be
held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the
holders of Senior Indebtedness or their respective representatives, or to the
trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior
Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, but
only to the extent that the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their
representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing
within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on the Senior
Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall
be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

         SECTION 15.3.     LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION, BANKRUPTCY. Upon any
payment by the Company or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any
dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or
other proceedings, all amounts due upon all Senior Indebtedness of the Company
shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money in
accordance with its terms, before any payment is made by the Company, on account
of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Debentures. Upon any
such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment by
the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities, which the Securityholders or the
Trustee would be entitled to receive from the Company, except for the provisions
of this Article XV, shall be paid by the Company, or by any receiver, trustee in
bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, or by the Securityholders or by the Trustee under this Indenture
if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness (pro
rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior
Indebtedness held by such holders, as calculated by the Company) or their
representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any
indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness
may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent
necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made
to the Securityholders or to the Trustee.

         In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing,

                                       41

<PAGE>

shall be received by the Trustee before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full,
or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms,
such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall
be paid over or delivered to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their
representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any
indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness
may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, as calculated by
the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness,
remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full
in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent
payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness.

         For purposes of this Article XV, the words "cash, property or
securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as
reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation
provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which
is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article XV with respect
to the Debentures to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness, that may at the
time be outstanding, provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by
the new corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or
readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness are
not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or
readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or
substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and
conditions provided for in Article XI of this Indenture shall not be deemed a
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this
Section if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation,
merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article XI
of this Indenture. Nothing in Section 15.2 or in this Section shall apply to
claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6 of this
Indenture.

         SECTION 15.4.     SUBROGATION. Subject to the payment in full of all
Senior Indebtedness, the Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of
the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of
cash, property or securities of the Company, applicable to such Senior
Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Debentures shall be paid in full. For the purposes of such subrogation, no
payments or distributions to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of any
cash, property or securities to which the Securityholders or the Trustee would
be entitled except for the provisions of this Article XV, and no payment over
pursuant to the provisions of this Article XV to or for the benefit of the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness by Securityholders or the Trustee, shall, as
between the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Company, and the holders of the Debentures be deemed to be a payment or
distribution by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness. It is
understood that the provisions of this Article XV are and are intended solely
for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the holders of the
Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, on the
other hand.

         Nothing contained in this Article XV or elsewhere in this Indenture or
in the Debentures is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its
creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the holders of the
Debentures, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay to the holders of the Debentures the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable
in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of the holders of the Debentures and creditors of the Company, other than
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent
the Trustee or the holder of any Debenture from exercising all remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject
to the rights, if any, under this Article XV of the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company, received
upon the exercise of any such remedy.

                                       42

<PAGE>

         Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to
in this Article XV, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article VI of this
Indenture, and the Securityholders shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon
any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending,
or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation trustee,
agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the
Trustee or to the Securityholders, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons
entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness
and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon,
the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article XV.

         SECTION 15.5.     TRUSTEE TO EFFECTUATE SUBORDINATION. Each
Securityholder by such Securityholder's acceptance thereof authorizes and
directs the Trustee on such Securityholder's behalf to take such action as may
be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this
Article XV and appoints the Trustee such Securityholder's attorney-in-fact for
any and all such purposes.

         SECTION 15.6.     NOTICE BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Principal Office
of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making
of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Debentures
pursuant to the provisions of this Article XV. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Article XV or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not
be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the
making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the
Debentures pursuant to the provisions of this Article XV, unless and until a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Principal Office of the Trustee shall
have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder or holders of
Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of any
such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article VI of
this Indenture, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts
exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice
provided for in this Section at least 2 Business Days prior to the date upon
which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or interest on any Debenture), then, anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to
receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were
received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be
received by it within 2 Business Days prior to such date.

         The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article VI of this Indenture,
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice
by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a
trustee or representative on behalf of such holder), to establish that such
notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee or
representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the
Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect
to the right of any Person as a holder of such Senior Indebtedness to
participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XV, the
Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by
such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such
payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such
Person under this Article XV, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the
Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as
to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

         SECTION 15.7.     RIGHTS OF THE TRUSTEE; HOLDERS OF SENIOR
INDEBTEDNESS. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all
the rights set forth in this Article XV in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at
any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior
Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of
its rights as such holder.

                                       43

<PAGE>

         With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Article XV, and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to
owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject
to the provisions of Article VI of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be
liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver
to Securityholders, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any
holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article
XV or otherwise.

         Nothing in this Article XV shall apply to claims of, or payments to,
the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6.

         SECTION 15.8.     SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED. No right of any
present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as
herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any
act or failure to act on the part of the Company, or by any act or failure to
act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company,
with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any
knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

         Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph,
the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time,
without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Securityholders, without
incurring responsibility to the Securityholders and without impairing or
releasing the subordination provided in this Article XV or the obligations
hereunder of the holders of the Debentures to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place
or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such
Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which
such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such
Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the
collection of such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights against the Company, and any other Person.

                           Vineyard National Bancorp.

                                December 19, 2002

         Vineyard National Bancorp., a California corporation (the "Company"
which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter
referred to), for value received promises to pay to Hare & Co. (the "Holder"),
as nominee for The Bank of New York, indenture trustee under the Indenture dated
as of December 19, 2002 among Preferred Term Securities VIII, Ltd., Preferred
Term Securities VIII, Inc. and The Bank of New York or registered assigns, the
principal sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) on December 26, 2017, and
to pay interest on said principal sum from December 19, 2002, or from the most
recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears on March
26, June 26, September 26 and December 26 of each year commencing March 26,
2003, at an annual rate equal to 4.46% beginning on (and including) the date of
original issuance and ending on (but excluding) March 26, 2003 and at an annual
rate for each successive period beginning on (and including) March 26,

2003, and each succeeding Interest Payment Date, and ending on (but excluding)
the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (each a "Distribution Period"), equal
to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus 3.05% (the "Coupon Rate");
provided, however, that prior to December 26, 2007, the Coupon Rate shall not
exceed 11.75%, applied to the principal amount hereof, until the principal
hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment, and on any
overdue principal and (without duplication) on any overdue installment of
interest at the same rate per annum, compounded quarterly, from the dates such
amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment. The amount of
interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360. In the event
that any date on which interest is payable on this Debenture is not a Business
Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the
next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other
payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in
the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on the date the payment was originally payable. The interest installment so
payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this
Debenture (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of
business on the regular record date for such interest installment, which shall
be fifteen days prior to the day on which the relevant Interest Payment Date
occurs. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided
for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular record
date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Debenture (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special
record date.

         "3-Month LIBOR" as used herein, means the London interbank offered
interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Trustee in
the following order of priority: (i) the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that appears on
Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related Determination
Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on the
Dow Jones Telerate Service or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that
service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British
Bankers' Association as the information vendor for the purpose of displaying
London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits); (ii) if such rate
cannot be identified on the related Determination Date, the Trustee will request
the principal London offices of four leading banks in the London interbank
market to provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as percentages per
annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S. dollar deposits
having a three-month maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will
be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; (iii) if fewer than two such
quotations are provided as requested in clause (ii) above, the Trustee will
request four major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered quotations
(expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for loans in U.S.
dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination Date. If at least
two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of
such quotations; and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations are provided as
requested in clause (iii) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month LIBOR
determined with respect to the Distribution Period immediately preceding such
current Distribution Period. If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a
three-month maturity that initially appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00
a.m. (London time) on the related Determination Date is superseded on the
Telerate Page 3750 by a corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such
Determination Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable
page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date. As used
herein, "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e., a business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period.

                                      A-3

<PAGE>

         The Coupon Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All percentages resulting from any calculations on the Debentures will
be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g.,
9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar
amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the
nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         The principal of and interest on this Debenture shall be payable at the
office or agency of the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the Company)
maintained for that purpose in any coin or currency of the United States of
America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the registered holder at such address as shall appear in the Debenture
Register if a request for a wire transfer by such holder has not been received
by the Company or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by the
holder hereof.

         The indebtedness evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided
in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Debenture is issued subject
to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each holder of this
Debenture, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the
subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her
attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each holder hereof, by his or
her acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the
subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of
Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives
reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

         This Debenture shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to, be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the
certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of
the Trustee.

         The provisions of this Debenture are continued on the reverse side
hereof and such provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though
fully set forth at this place.

                         [FORM OF REVERSE OF DEBENTURE]

         This Debenture is one of the floating rate junior subordinated
debentures of the Company, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to the
Indenture dated as of December 19, 2002 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and
delivered between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture reference is
hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of
the Debentures. The Debentures are limited in aggregate principal amount as
specified in the Indenture.

         In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debentures,
in whole or in part, but in all cases in a principal amount with integral
multiples of $1,000.00, on any Interest Payment Date on or after December 26,
2007, at the Redemption Price.

         Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, the
Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents an
amount of money sufficient to redeem on the Redemption Date all the Debentures
so called for redemption at the appropriate Redemption Price, together with
accrued interest to the Redemption Date.

         If all, or less than all, the Debentures are to be redeemed, the
Company will give the Trustee notice not less than 45 nor more than 60 days,
respectively, prior to the Redemption Date as to the aggregate principal amount
of Debentures to be redeemed and the Trustee shall select, in such manner as in
its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Debentures or
portions thereof (in integral multiples of $1,000.00) to be redeemed.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, any redemption of Debentures by the
Company shall be subject to the receipt of any and all required regulatory
approvals.

         In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon
demand of the Trustee, the principal of all of the Debentures shall become due
and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions
provided in the Indenture, including the receipt of any and all required
regulatory approvals.

         The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the
Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding, to execute
supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing
in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any
supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders
of the Debentures; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall
without the consent of the holders of each Debenture then outstanding and
affected thereby (i) change the fixed maturity of any Debenture, or reduce the
principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend
the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on
redemption thereof or make the principal thereof or any interest or premium
thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the
Debentures, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute
suit for payment thereof or impair the right of repayment, if any, at the option
of the holder, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debentures the holders
of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture.

         The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding
on behalf of the holders of all of the Debentures to waive (or modify any
previously granted waiver of) any past default or Default, and its consequences,
except a default (a) in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any of the Debentures or (b) in respect of covenants or provisions
hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of
each Debenture affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby

                                      A-6

<PAGE>

shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of the Indenture and the Company,
the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other default or Default or impair any right consequent
thereon. Whenever any default or Default hereunder shall have been waived as
permitted by the Indenture, said default or Default shall for all purposes of
the Debentures and the Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not
continuing. The term "default" for the purpose of this paragraph is defined to
be the events specified in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3 of the Indenture, not
including periods of grace, if any, provided for therein.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on this Debenture at the time and place and at the rate and in the
money herein described.

         The Company has agreed that if there shall have occurred and be
continuing an Event of Default, then the Company shall not, and shall not allow
any Affiliate of the Company to, (x) declare or pay any dividends or
distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment
with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or its Affiliates' capital
stock (other than payments of dividends or distributions to the Company) or make
any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing or (y) make any payment of
principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem
any debt securities of the Company or any Affiliate that rank pari passu in all
respects with or junior in interest to the Debentures (other than, with respect
to clauses (x) and (y) above, (1) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions
of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment
contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of
one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a
dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with
the issuance of capital stock of the Company (or securities convertible into or
exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition
transaction entered into prior to the applicable Extension Period, if any, (2)
as a result of any exchange or conversion of any class or series of the
Company's capital stock (or any capital stock of a subsidiary of the Company)
for any class or series of the Company's capital stock or of any class or series
of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's capital
stock, (3) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's
capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital
stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (4) any declaration of a
dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of
rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the
redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, or (5) any dividend in the
form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the
stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the
same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with
or junior to such stock and any cash payments in lieu of fractional shares
issued in connection therewith.

         The Debentures are issuable only in registered, certificated form
without coupons and in minimum denominations of $100,000.00 and any multiple of
$1,000.00 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to the
transfer restrictions and limitations as may be contained herein and therein
from time to time, this Debenture is transferable by the holder hereof on the
Debenture Register of the Company. Upon due presentment for registration of
transfer of any Debenture at the Principal Office of the Trustee or at any
office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose as provided in
Section 3.2 of the Indenture, the Company shall execute, the Company or the
Trustee shall register and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall
authenticate and make available for delivery in the name of the transferee or
transferees a new Debenture for a like aggregate principal amount. All
Debentures presented for registration of transfer or for exchange or payment
shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent)
be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument

                                      A-7

<PAGE>

or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee
or the Authenticating Agent duly executed by the holder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or
registration of transfer of Debentures, but the Company or the Trustee may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

         Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Debenture,
the Company, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any paying agent, any
transfer agent and any Debenture registrar may deem the Person in whose name
such Debenture shall be registered upon the Debenture Register to be, and may
treat him as, the absolute owner of such Debenture (whether or not such
Debenture shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on
account of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Debenture and
for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any
Authenticating Agent nor any paying agent nor any transfer agent nor any
Debenture registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such
payments so made to any holder for the time being or upon his order shall be
valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Debenture.

         No recourse for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on any Debenture, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in
respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or
agreement of the Company in the Indenture or in any supplemental indenture, or
in any such Debenture, or because of the creation of any indebtedness
represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder,
employee, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company
or of any successor Person of the Company, either directly or through the
Company or any successor Person of the Company, whether by virtue of any
constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
penalty or otherwise, it being expressly understood that all such liability is
hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration
for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Debentures.

         Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Debenture shall have the
meanings assigned in the Indenture dated as of the date of original issuance of
this Debenture between the Trustee and the Company.

         THE INDENTURE AND THE DEBENTURES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF
LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

         I, Phillip Hinds, a director of Preferred Term Securities VIII, Ltd.,
an exempted company with limited liability duly incorporated under the laws of
the Cayman Islands (the "Company"), hereby request that State Street Bank and

         and

                  (ii) the Company has not acquired the Temporary Debenture and
         will not be acquiring the Permanent Debenture for the account or
         benefit of any such U.S. Person.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name as of the date first
