<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any criminal conviction under the laws of the United States or any state or other political subdivision thereof which, in the good faith determination of the Chief Executive Officer of SHG, renders you unsuitable as an officer or employee of SHG.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your continued failure to substantially perform the duties reasonably requested by the Chief Executive Officer of SHG and commensurate with your position as President of SunScript (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to your physical or mental condition) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Chief Executive Officer of SHG, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Chief Executive Officer of SHG believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not substantially corrected by your within ten (10) days of receipt of such demand; and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any material workplace misconduct or willful failure to comply with SunScript's and/or SHG's general policies and procedures as they may exist from time to time by you which, in the good faith determination of the Chief Executive Officer of SHG, renders you unsuitable as an officer or employee.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if any of the following events occurs:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of SHG (an "Acquiring Person"), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 33 1/3% of the then outstanding voting stock of  Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A merger or consolidation of either Parent or SunScript with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of SHG outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 51% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of SHG or surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;</P>

<P align="center">5</P>
<hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sale or other disposition by Parent or SunScript of all or substantially all of its respective assets;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period of two (2) consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors and any new director (other than a director who is a representative or nominee of an Acquiring Person) whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by Parent's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination was previously so approved, no longer constitute a majority of the Board of Directors;</P></DIR>

<P>provided, however, in no event shall any acquisition of securities, a change in the composition of the Board of Directors or a merger or other consolidation pursuant to a plan of reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to SHG ("Chapter 11 Plan"), or a liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code constitute a Change in Control.  In addition, notwithstanding Sections 9(b)(1), 9(b)(2), 9(b)(3) and 9(b)(4), a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred in the event of a sale or conveyance in which SHG continues as a holding company of an entity or entities that conduct the business or businesses formerly conducted by SHG, or any transaction undertaken for the purpose of reincorporating SHG under the laws of another jurisdiction, if such transaction does not materially affect the beneficial ownership of SHG's capital stock.  Your continued employment without objection following a Change in Control shall not, by itself, constitute consent to or a waiver of rights with respect to any circumstances constituting Good Reason hereunder.  A Change in Control shall not, by itself, constitute Good Reason hereunder.  A termination of your employment without Good Cause (other than by reason of your death or Disability) within six (6) months preceding a Change in Control shall be treated as if such termination occurred on the date of such Change in Control if it is reasonably demonstrated that the termination was at the request of the third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect such Change in Control or otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of such Change in Control.</P>

<P>Provided, however, that an event described in the clauses above shall not constitute Good Reason unless it is communicated by you to SunScript and/or SHG in writing and is not corrected by SunScript and/or SHG in a manner which is reasonably satisfactory to you (including full retroactive correction with respect to any monetary matter) within 10 days of SunScript's and/or SHG's receipt of such written notice from you.</P>
