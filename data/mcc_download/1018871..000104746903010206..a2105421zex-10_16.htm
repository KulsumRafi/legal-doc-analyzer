<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>4.1 Elective Deferrals<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>An individual who is an Eligible Employee on the Effective Date may, by completing an Election Form and filing it with the Plan Administrator within 30&nbsp;days following
the Effective Date, elect to defer a percentage or dollar amount of one or more payments of Compensation, on such terms as the Plan Administrator may permit, which are payable to the Participant after
the date on which the individual files the Election Form. Any individual who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Effective Date may, by completing an Election Form and filing it with the Plan
Administrator within 30&nbsp;days following the date on which the Plan Administrator gives such individual written notice that the individual is an Eligible Employee, elect to defer a percentage or
dollar amount of one or more payments of Compensation, on such terms as the Plan Administrator may permit, which are payable to the Participant after the date on which the individual files the
Election Form. Any Eligible Employee who has not otherwise initially elected to defer Compensation in accordance with this Section&nbsp;4.1 may elect to defer a percentage or dollar amount of one or
more payments of Compensation, on such terms as the Plan Administrator may permit, commencing with Compensation paid in the next succeeding Plan Year, by completing an Election Form prior to the first
day of such succeeding Plan Year. A Participant's Compensation shall be reduced in accordance with the Participant's election hereunder and amounts deferred hereunder shall be paid by the Employer to
the Trust as soon as administratively feasible and credited to the Participant's Account as of the date the amounts are received by the Trustee. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
election to defer a percentage or dollar amount of Compensation for any Plan Year shall apply for subsequent Plan Years unless changed or revoked. A Participant may change or revoke his or her
deferral election as of the first day of any Plan Year by giving written notice to the Plan Administrator before such first day (or any such earlier date as the Plan Administrator may prescribe). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>4.2 Matching Deferrals<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>After each payroll period, monthly, quarterly, or annually, at the Employer's discretion, the Employer shall contribute to the Trust Matching Deferrals equal to the rate of
Matching Contribution selected by the Employer and multiplied by the amount of the Elective Deferrals credited to the Participants' Accounts for such period under Section&nbsp;4.1. Each Matching
Deferral will be credited, as of the later of the date it is received by the Trustee or the date the Trustee receives from the Plan Administrator such instructions as the Trustee may reasonably
require to allocate the amount received among the asset accounts maintained by the Trustee, to the Participants' Accounts pro rata in accordance with the amount of Elective Deferrals of each

Contribution to his or her Account on such terms as the Employer shall specify at the time it makes the contribution. For example, the Employer may contribute an amount to a Participant's Account and
condition the payment of that amount and accrued earnings thereon upon the Participant remaining employed by the Employer for an additional specified period of time. The terms specified by the
Employer shall supersede any other provision of this Plan as regards Incentive Contributions and earnings with respect thereto, provided that if the Employer does not specify a method of distribution,
the Incentive Contribution shall be distributed in a manner consistent with the election last made by the particular Participant prior to the year in which the Incentive Contribution is made. The

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>9.3 Existing Rights<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>No amendment or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect the rights of any Participant with respect to amounts that have been credited to his or her Account prior to the

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.1 No Funding<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Plan constitutes a mere promise by the Employer to make payments in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and Participants and beneficiaries shall have the status of
general unsecured creditors of the Employer. Nothing in the Plan will be construed to give any employee or any other person rights to any specific assets of the Employer or of any other person. In all
events, it is the intent of the Employer that the Plan be treated as unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.2 Non-Assignability<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant or beneficiary shall be subject to any claim of any creditor of any Participant or beneficiary and, in
particular, the same shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or other legal process by any creditor of such Participant or beneficiary, nor shall any Participant or beneficiary have any
right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds that he or she may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.3 Limitation of Participants' Rights<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Nothing contained in the Plan shall confer upon any person a right to be employed or to continue in
the employ of the Employer, or interfere in any way with the right of the Employer to terminate the employment of a Participant in the Plan at any time, with or without cause. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.4 Participants Bound<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Any action with respect to the Plan taken by the Plan Administrator or the Employer or the Trustee or any action authorized by or taken at the direction of the Plan

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.5 Receipt and Release<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Any payment to any Participant or beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against
the
Employer, the Plan Administrator and the Trustee under the Plan, and the Plan Administrator may require such Participant or beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt
and release to such effect. If any Participant or beneficiary is determined by the Plan Administrator to be incompetent by reason of physical or mental disability (including minority) to give a valid
receipt and release, the Plan Administrator may cause the payment or payments becoming due to such person to be made to another person for his or her benefit without responsibility on the part of the
Plan Administrator, the Employer or the Trustee to follow the application of such funds. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>10.6 Governing Law<BR>  </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects under and by the laws of the state in which the Employer maintains its primary place of business. If any
