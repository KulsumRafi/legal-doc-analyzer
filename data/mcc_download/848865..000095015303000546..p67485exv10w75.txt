                The Company shall not make, and shall not permit any Restricted
         Subsidiary to make, any Asset Disposition unless: (i) the Company (or
         such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration
         at the time of such disposition at least equal to the fair market value
         of the shares or the assets disposed of, as determined in good faith by
         the Board of Directors for any transaction (or series of transactions)
         involving in excess of $10 million and not involving the sale of
         equipment or other assets specifically contemplated by the Company's
         capital expenditure budget previously approved by the Board of
         Directors; (ii) at least 75% (or any lesser amount as provided below)

         on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted
         Subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting
         principles (excluding Debt or any other liabilities subordinate in
         right of payment to the Notes) and release from all liability on such
         Debt or other liabilities assumed, (C) assets used in, or stock or
         other ownership interests in a Person that upon the consummation of
         such Asset Disposition becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and will be
         principally engaged in, the business of the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries as such business is conducted immediately prior
         to such Asset Disposition, (D) any securities, notes or other
         obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary
         from such transferee that are contemporaneously (subject to ordinary
         settlement periods) converted by the Company or such Restricted
         Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of cash and
         Cash Equivalents received), (E) any Designated Noncash Consideration
         received pursuant to this clause (E) that is at the time outstanding,
         not to exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the

         Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
         effect to subsequent changes in value), or (F) any combination thereof;
         and (iii) 100% of the Net Available Proceeds from such Asset
         Disposition (including from the sale of any marketable cash equivalents
         received therein) are applied by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
         as follows: (A) first, within one year from the later of the date of
         such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Proceeds,
         to repayment of Debt of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries then
         outstanding under the Credit Facility which would require such
         application or which would prohibit payments pursuant to clause (B);
         (B) second, to the extent Net Available Proceeds are not required to be
         applied as specified in clause (A), to purchases of outstanding Notes
         and other Debt of the Company that ranks pari passu in right of payment
         to the Notes (on a pro rata basis based upon the outstanding aggregate
         principal amount thereof) pursuant to an Offer to Purchase (to the
         extent such an offer is not prohibited by the terms of the Credit
         Facility then in effect) at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
         principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of purchase
         (subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant Regular
         Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is
         on or prior to the purchase date); and (C) third, to the extent of any
         remaining Net Available Proceeds following completion of such Offer to
         Purchase, to any other use as determined by the Company which is not
         otherwise prohibited by this Ninth Supplemental Indenture and provided
         further that the 75% limitation referred to in clause (ii) above shall
         not apply to any Asset Disposition if the consideration received
         therefrom, as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of
         Directors, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds
         would have been had the Asset Disposition complied with the
         aforementioned 75% limitation.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
         required to comply with the provisions described in clause (iii) of the
         preceding paragraph: (i) if the Net Available Proceeds ("REINVESTED
         AMOUNTS") are invested or committed to be invested within one year from
         the later of the date of the related Asset Disposition or the receipt
         of such Net Available Proceeds in assets that will be used in the
         business of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as such
         business is conducted prior to such Asset Disposition (determined by
         the Board of Directors in good faith) or (ii) to the extent the Company
         elects to redeem the Notes with the Net Available Proceeds pursuant to
         any of the provisions of subsection (5) of this Section 1.01.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
         to comply with the requirements described in clause (ii) of the second
         preceding paragraph if the Asset Disposition is an Excepted
         Disposition.

                Any Offer to Purchase pursuant to this subsection 12(a) shall be
         effected by the sending of the written terms and conditions thereof
         (the "OFFER DOCUMENT") by the Company, by first class mail, to Holders
         of the Notes within 30 days after the date which is one year after the
         later of the date of consummation of the Asset Disposition referred to
         in this subsection 12(a) or the receipt of the Net Available Proceeds
         from such Asset Disposition. The aggregate principal amount of the


                                       5
<PAGE>

         Notes to be offered to be purchased pursuant to the Offer to Purchase
         shall equal the Net Available Proceeds required to be made available
         therefor pursuant to clause (iii)(B) of this subsection 12(a) (rounded
         down to the next lowest integral multiple of $1,000). Each Holder shall
         be entitled to tender all or any portion of the Notes owned by such
         Holder pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, subject to the requirement
         that any portion of a Note tendered must be tendered in an integral
         multiple of $1,000 principal amount.

                (b) CHANGE OF CONTROL.
                    -----------------

         outstanding Notes, at a purchase price equal to 101% of their aggregate
         principal amount plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase
         (subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant Regular
         Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is
         on or prior to the date of purchase).

                A "CHANGE OF CONTROL" shall be deemed to have occurred in the

         of Directors of Allied such that such nominees, when added to any
         existing director remaining on the Board of Directors of Allied after
         such election who is an Affiliate or Related Person of such Person or
         Allied Group, shall constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of
         Allied, or (c) there occurs any transaction or series of related
         transactions other than a merger, consolidation or other transaction

         of Allied (or its successor or parent, as the case may be), (II) cash,
         securities and other property in an amount which could be paid by the
         Company as a Restricted Payment under this Ninth Supplemental Indenture

         combination thereof, and the beneficial owners of the Voting Stock of
         Allied immediately prior to such transaction (or series) do not,
         immediately after such transaction (or series), beneficially own Voting
         Stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of all
         classes of Voting Stock of Allied (or in the case of a transaction (or
         series) in which another entity becomes a successor to, or parent of,
         Allied, of the successor or parent entity), and

         Person, or any Persons (other than a Permitted Allied Successor),
         acting together that would constitute a Group for purposes of Section
         13(d) of the Exchange Act (an "AWNA GROUP"), together with any
         Affiliates or Related Persons thereof (other than any employee stock
         ownership plan) beneficially own 50% or more of the total voting power
         of all classes of Voting Stock of the Company, (b) any Person or AWNA

         Directors of the Company such that such nominees, when added to any
         existing director remaining on the Board of Directors of the Company
         after such election who is an Affiliate or Related Person of such
         Person or AWNA Group, shall constitute a majority of the Board of
         Directors of the Company, or (c) there occurs any transaction or series
         of related transactions other than a merger, consolidation or other
         transaction with a Related Business in which the shareholders of the

         solely Voting Stock of the Company (or its successor or parent, as the
         case may be), (II) cash, securities and other property in an amount
         which could be paid by the Company as a Restricted Payment under this
         Ninth Supplemental Indenture after giving pro forma effect to such

         of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such
         transaction (or series) do not, immediately after such transaction (or
         series), beneficially own Voting Stock representing more than 50% of
         the total voting power of all classes of Voting Stock of the Company
         (or in the case of a transaction (or series) in which another entity
         becomes a successor to the Company, of the successor entity).

                The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1

         thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in
         connection with the repurchase of the Notes resulting from a Change of
         Control.

                The Company and the Trustee shall perform their respective
         obligations specified in the Offer Document for the Offer to Purchase.

         payment in an amount equal to the Purchase Price for each $1,000 of
         Notes so accepted, and the Company shall promptly execute a new Note or

         Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Debt or issue Preferred Stock
         unless, immediately after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt
         or issuance of such Preferred Stock and the receipt and application of
         the proceeds thereof, the Consolidated EBITDA Coverage Ratio of the
         Company for the four full fiscal quarters next preceding the Incurrence
         of such Debt or issuance of such Preferred Stock, calculated on a pro
         forma basis if such Debt had been Incurred or such Preferred Stock had
         been issued and the proceeds thereof had been received and so applied
         at the beginning of the four full fiscal quarters, would be greater
         than 2.0 to 1.0.

                Subsidiary or Debt owed by a Restricted Subsidiary to the
                Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that
                in the event that either (x) the Company or the Restricted
                Subsidiary to which such Debt is owed transfers or

                Company or another Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) such Restricted
                Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, the provisions
                of this clause (iii) shall no longer be applicable to such Debt
                and such Debt shall be deemed to have been incurred at the time
                of such transfer or other disposition or at the time such
                Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary;

                provisions described under Section 7.1 of the Indenture (as
                superseded by subsection 13 of this Section 1.01 of this Ninth
                Supplemental Indenture), which Debt: (x) was issued by a Person
                prior to the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary in
                such transaction (including by way of merger or consolidation
                with the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) and was not
                issued in contemplation of such transaction, or (y) is issued by
                the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to a seller in connection
                with such transaction, in an aggregate amount for all such Debt

                Indenture described under this clause (v) and then outstanding

                or in clauses (i) through (v) above or Incurred pursuant to this
                clause (vii); provided, however, that such Debt does not exceed
                the principal amount of Debt so renewed, extended, refinanced or
                refunded (plus the amount of any premium and accrued interest,
                plus customary fees, consent payments, expenses and costs
                relating to the Debt so renewed, extended, refinanced or
                refunded) ("Permitted Refinancing Debt"); and

                         (viii) Debt not otherwise permitted to be Incurred
                pursuant to clauses (i) through (vii) above, which, in aggregate
                amount, together with the aggregate amount of all other Debt
                previously Incurred pursuant to the provisions of this clause

         encumbrance or restriction contained in such renewal, extension,

         such encumbrance or restriction is the result of applicable corporate
         law or regulation relating to the payment of dividends or

         guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company
         (each of the foregoing, an "AFFILIATE TRANSACTION"), unless: (a) such
         Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the
         Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been
         obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted
         Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and (b) the Company delivers to
         the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
         related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in
         excess of $10 million, either: (i) a resolution of the Board of
         Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such
         Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above and that such
         Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
         disinterested members of the Board of Directors, or (ii) an opinion as
         to the fairness to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
         case may be, of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of
         view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of
         national standing.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following items shall not be
         deemed to be Affiliate Transactions: (a) customary directors' fees,
         indemnification or similar arrangements or any employment agreement or
         other compensation plan or arrangement entered into by the Company or
         any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
         including ordinary course loans to employees not to exceed: (i) $5
         million outstanding in the aggregate at any time, and (ii) $2 million



                                       13

         to any one employee and consistent with the past practice of the
         Company or such Restricted Subsidiary; (b) loans by the Company and its
         Restricted Subsidiaries to employees of Allied or any of its
         Subsidiaries in connection with management incentive plans not to
         exceed $25 million at any time outstanding; provided that such
         limitation shall not apply to loans the proceeds of which are used to
         purchase common stock of: (i) the Company from the Company, or (ii)
         Allied from Allied if and to the extent that Allied utilizes the
         proceeds thereof to acquire Capital Stock (other than Redeemable
         Interests) of the Company; (c) transactions between or among the
         Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries; (d) payments of customary
         fees by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to investment
         banking firms and financial advisors made for any financial advisory,
         financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other
         investment banking activities, including, without limitation, in
         connection with acquisitions or divestitures which are approved by a
         majority of the Board of Directors in good faith; (e) any agreement as
         in effect on the date of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture or any
         amendment thereto (so long as such amendment is not disadvantageous to
         the Holders of the Notes in any material respect) or any transaction
         contemplated thereby; and (f) Restricted Payments that are permitted by
         the provisions of subsection 12(e) of this Section 1.01 of this Ninth
         Supplemental Indenture.

                (i) PROVISION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.
                    ----------------------------------

                Whether or not Allied is required to be subject to Section 13(a)
         or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision thereto, the
         Company (or Allied for so long as the Company is a Wholly-Owned
         Subsidiary of Allied) shall file with the Commission the annual
         reports, quarterly reports and other documents which the Company (or
         Allied for so long as the Company is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of
         Allied) would have been required to file with the Commission pursuant
         to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or any successor provision thereto if
         the Company (or Allied for so long as the Company is a Wholly-Owned
         Subsidiary of Allied) were so required, such documents to be filed with
         the Commission on or prior to the respective dates (the "REQUIRED
         FILING DATES") by which the Company would have been required so to file
         such documents if the Company were so required. The Company shall also
         in any event: (a) within 15 days of each Required Filing Date file with
         the Trustee copies of the annual reports, quarterly reports and other
         documents which the Company (or Allied for so long as the Company is a
         Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Allied) filed with the Commission pursuant
         to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or any successor provisions thereto or
         would have been required to file with the Commission pursuant to such
         Section 13(a) or 15(d) or any successor provisions thereto if the
         Company (or Allied for so long as the Company is a Wholly-Owned
         Subsidiary of Allied) were required to comply with such Sections, and
         (b) if filing such documents by the Company (or Allied for so long as
         the Company is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Allied) with the Commission
         is not permitted under the Exchange Act, promptly upon written request
         supply copies of such documents to any prospective Holder.

                (j) UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES.
                    -------------------------

                The Company at any time may designate any Person that is a
         Subsidiary, or after the date of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture
         becomes a Subsidiary, of the Company as an "UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY,"
         whereupon (and until such Person ceases to be an Unrestricted
         Subsidiary) such Person and each other Person that is then or
         thereafter becomes a Subsidiary of such Person shall be deemed to be an
         Unrestricted Subsidiary. In addition, the Company may at any time
         terminate the status of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
         Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary and each other Subsidiary of the
         Company (if any) of which such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary shall be a
         Restricted Subsidiary.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing, no change in the status of a
         Subsidiary of the Company from a Restricted Subsidiary to an
         Unrestricted Subsidiary or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
         Restricted Subsidiary will be effective, and no Person may otherwise
         become a Restricted Subsidiary, if:

                         (i) in the case of any change in status of a Restricted
                Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the Restricted Payment
                resulting from such change, would violate the provisions of
                clause (3) of the first paragraph of subsection 12(e) of this
                Section 1.01 of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture; or

                         (ii) such change or other event would otherwise result
                (after the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both) in an
                Event of Default.

                In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing, no Restricted
         Subsidiary of the Company may become an Unrestricted Subsidiary, and
         the status of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
         will be deemed to have been immediately terminated (whereupon such
         Subsidiary and each other Subsidiary of the Company (if any) of which
         such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary will be a Restricted Subsidiary) at any
         time when:

                         (i) such Subsidiary (A) has outstanding Debt that is
                Unpermitted Debt (as defined below), or (B) owns or holds any
                Capital Stock of or other ownership interests in, or a Lien on
                any property or other assets of, the Company or any of its
                Restricted Subsidiaries; or

                         (ii) the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary (A)
                provides credit support for, or a Guarantee of, any Debt of such
                Subsidiary (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument
                evidencing such Debt), or (B) is directly or indirectly liable
                on any Debt of such Subsidiary. Any termination of the status of
                an Unrestricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
                pursuant to the preceding sentence will be deemed to result in a
                breach of this covenant in any circumstance in which the Company
                would not be permitted to change the status of such Unrestricted
                Subsidiary to the status of a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to
                the preceding paragraph.

<PAGE>
                "UNPERMITTED DEBT" means any Debt of a Subsidiary of the Company
                if: (x) a default thereunder (or under any instrument or
                agreement pursuant to or by which such Debt is issued, secured
                or evidenced) or any right that the Holders thereof may have to
                take enforcement action against such Subsidiary or its property
                or other assets, would permit (whether or not after the giving
                of notice or the lapse of time or both) the Holders of any Debt
                of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary to declare the
                same due and payable prior to the date on which it otherwise
                would have become due and payable or otherwise to take any
                enforcement action against the Company or any such other
                Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) such Debt is secured by a Lien on
                any property or other assets of the Company and any of its other
                Restricted Subsidiaries.

                Each Person that is or becomes a Subsidiary of the Company shall
                be deemed to be a Restricted Subsidiary at all times when it is
                a Subsidiary of the Company that is not an Unrestricted
                Subsidiary. Each Person that is or becomes a Wholly-Owned
                Subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed to be a Wholly-Owned
                Restricted Subsidiary at all times when it is a Wholly-Owned
                Subsidiary of the Company that is not an Unrestricted
                Subsidiary.

                (13) MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND CERTAIN SALES OF ASSETS.
Section 7.1 of the Indenture is hereby superseded by the following in
respect of the Notes:

         "The Company (i) shall not consolidate with or merge into any Person;
(ii) shall not permit any Person other than a Restricted Subsidiary to
consolidate with or merge into the Company; and (iii) may not, directly or
indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, transfer, convey, sell, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; unless, in each case
of (i), (ii) and (iii) above:

                (1) immediately before and after giving effect to such
         transaction (or series) and treating any Debt Incurred by the Company
         or a Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such transaction (or
         series) as having been incurred by the Company of such Subsidiary at
         the time of the transaction (or series), no Event of Default, or event
         that with the passing of time or the giving of notice, or both, will
         constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing;

                (2) in a transaction (or series) in which the Company does not
         survive or in which the Company transfers, conveys, sells, leases or
         otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and
         assets, the successor entity is a corporation, partnership, limited
         liability company or trust and is organized and validly existing under
         the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the
         District of Columbia and expressly assumes, by a supplemental indenture
         executed and delivered to the Trustee in form satisfactory to the
         Trustee, all the Company's obligations under this Ninth Supplemental
         Indenture;



                                       16
<PAGE>
                (3) if such transaction (or series) occurs prior to the
         occurrence of a Rating Event Date, either (x) the Company or the
         successor entity would, at the time of such transaction (or series) and
         after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction (or
         series) had occurred at the beginning of the most recently ended four
         full fiscal quarter period for which internal financial statements are
         available immediately preceding the date of such transaction (or
         series), have been permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt
         pursuant to the Consolidated EBITDA Coverage Ratio test set forth in
         the first paragraph under subsection 12(d) of this Section 1.01, or (y)
         the Consolidated EBITDA Coverage Ratio of the Company or the successor
         entity for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarter period for
         which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding
         the date of such transaction (or series), calculated on a pro forma
         basis as if such transaction (or series) had occurred at the beginning
         of such four full fiscal quarter period, would be no less than such
         Consolidated EBITDA Coverage Ratio, calculated without giving effect to
         such transaction or series or any other transactions (or series) that
         is subject to the provisions of the Indenture described in this
         paragraph and that occurred after the date that is twelve months before
         the date of such transaction (or series);

                (4) if, as a result of any such transaction, property or assets
         of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company would become
         subject to a Lien prohibited by subsection 12(g) of this Section 1.01,
         the Company or the successor entity shall have secured the Notes as
         required by such covenant; and

                (5) the Company has  delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
         Certificate  and an Opinion of Counsel as specified in the Indenture.

                The Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the proposed
         consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, lease or other disposition an
         Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel
         stating that the proposed consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, lease
         or other disposition and such supplemental indenture comply with the
         Indenture and that all conditions precedent to the consummation of such
         transaction under this Section 7.1 have been met."

                (14) SECURITY.
                     --------

         The Security Agreements shall secure the due and punctual payment of
the principal of and interest and Special Interest, if any, on the Notes when
and as the same shall be due and payable, whether on an interest payment date,
at maturity, by acceleration, repurchase, redemption or otherwise, and interest
on the overdue principal of and interest and Special Interest (to the extent
permitted by law), if any, on the Notes and performance of all other obligations
of the Company to the Holders of Notes or the Trustee under this Ninth
Supplemental Indenture and the Notes, according to the terms hereunder or
thereunder. Each Holder of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, consents and agrees
to the terms of the Security Agreements (including, without limitation, the
provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Collateral) as the same
may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with their
terms. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all documents


                                       17
<PAGE>
delivered to the collateral trustee pursuant to the Security Agreements, and
shall do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary or
proper, or as may be required by the provisions of the Security Agreements, to
assure and confirm to the Trustee and the collateral trustee the security
interest in the Collateral contemplated hereby, by the Security Agreements or
any part thereof, as from time to time constituted, so as to render the same
available for the security and benefit of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture and
of the Notes secured hereby, according to the intent and purposes herein
expressed. The Company shall take, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to take, upon
request of the Trustee, any and all actions reasonably required to cause the
Security Agreements to create and maintain, as security for the obligations of
the Company under this Ninth Supplemental Indenture and the Notes, a valid and
enforceable perfected first priority Lien in and on all the Collateral in favor
of the collateral trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Notes.

                (a) Opinions and Certificates.

                    (i) The Company shall furnish to the Trustee all opinions
         and certificates delivered by the Company in connection with the
         Security Agreements and such opinions and certificates shall be for the
         benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.

                    (ii) The Company shall otherwise comply with the provisions
         of TIA ss.314(b).

                (b) Release of Collateral.

                    (i) Subject to this subsection 14(b) of this Section 1.01 of
         this Ninth Supplemental Indenture, the Collateral may be released from
         the Lien and security interest created by the Security Agreements at
         any time or from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the
         Security Agreements. The collateral trustee shall execute, deliver or
         acknowledge any necessary or proper instruments of termination,
         satisfaction or release to evidence the release of any Collateral
         permitted to be released pursuant to this Ninth Supplemental Indenture
         or the Security Agreements.

                    (ii) The release of any Collateral from the terms of this
         Ninth Supplemental Indenture and the Security Agreements shall not be
         deemed to impair the security under this Ninth Supplemental Indenture
         in contravention of the provisions hereof if and to the extent the
         Collateral is released pursuant to the terms of the Security
         Agreements. To the extent applicable, the Company shall cause
         TIA ss.313(b), relating to reports, and TIA ss.314(d), relating to the
         release of property or securities from the Lien and security interest
         of the Security Agreements and relating to the substitution therefor of
         any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien and security
         interest of the Security Agreements, to be complied with. The Company
         shall furnish to the Trustee and the collateral trustee, prior to each
         proposed release of Collateral pursuant to the Security Agreements, (i)
         all documents required by TIA ss.314(d) and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel,
         which may be rendered by internal counsel to the Company, to the effect
         that such accompanying documents constitute all documents required by
         TIA ss.314(d).


                                       18
<PAGE>
                    (iii) Any certificate or opinion required by TIA ss.314(d)
         may be made by an Officer of the Company except in cases where TIA
         ss.314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an
         independent Person, which Person shall be an independent engineer,
         appraiser or other expert selected or approved by the Trustee and the
         collateral trustee in the exercise of reasonable care.

                    (iv) In the event that the Company wishes to obtain a
         release of any Collateral in accordance with the Security Agreements
         and has delivered the certificates and documents required by the
         Security Agreements and this subsection 14(b) of this Section 1.01 of
         this Ninth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall determine whether
         it has received all documentation required by TIAss.314(d) in
         connection with such release and, based on such determination and the
         Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to Section 10.03(b), shall
         deliver a certificate to the collateral trustee setting forth such
         determination. The Trustee may, to the extent permitted by the
         Indenture, accept as conclusive evidence of compliance with the
         foregoing provisions the appropriate statements contained in such
         documents and such Opinion of Counsel.

                (c) Authorization of Actions to Be Taken by the Trustee Under
the Security Agreements. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee
may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Holders of Notes,
instruct, on behalf of the Holders of Notes, the collateral trustee to take all
actions it deems necessary or appropriate in order to (a) enforce the rights of
the Trustee and the Holders of Notes under any of the terms of the Security
Agreements and (b) collect and receive any and all amounts payable in respect of
the obligations of the Company under this Ninth Supplemental Indenture and the
Notes, provided, that in no event shall the collateral trustee be required to
take any actions that violate the terms of the Security Agreements or the Credit
Facility. The Trustee shall have power to institute and maintain such suits and
proceedings as it may deem expedient to preserve or protect its interests and
the interests of the Trustee and the Holders of Notes in the Collateral.

                (d) Authorization of Receipt of Funds by the Trustee Under the
Security Agreements. The Trustee is authorized to receive any funds for the
benefit of the Holders of Notes distributed under the Security Agreements, and
to make further distributions of such funds to the Holders of Notes according to
the provisions of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture.

                (e) Termination of Security Interest. Upon (1) the full and
final payment and performance of all obligations of the Company under this Ninth
Supplemental Indenture and the Notes; (2) the release of the Lien on the
Collateral securing the BFI Notes, the Allied NA Senior Notes and all other
indebtedness of Allied and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than under the
Credit Facility); or (3) the sale of any such Collateral in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall,
at the request of the Company, deliver a certificate to the collateral trustee
instructing the collateral trustee to release the Liens (or in the case of
clause (3), the Liens on such Collateral) pursuant to this Ninth Supplemental
Indenture and the Security Agreements.

                (f) No Amendments to the Security Agreements. The Company shall
not amend, waive or modify any provisions of the Security Agreements if such
amendment, waiver or


                                       19
<PAGE>

modification could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the Holder of
Notes without the consent of a majority of Holder of Notes.

                (g) Maintenance. The Company shall maintain as security for the
obligations of the Company under this Ninth Supplement Indenture and the Notes,
an equal and ratable sharing of the perfected security interest held by the
collateral trustee under the uniform commercial code as in effect in the State
of New York pursuant to the Security Agreements in the Collateral.

         (15) Events of Default. In addition to the Events of Default set forth
in Section 5.1 of the Indenture, the Notes shall include the following
additional Event of Default designated as clause (j) of such Section, which
shall be deemed an Event of Default under Section 5.1 of the Indenture:

         (a) TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS IN GLOBAL NOTES FOR DEFINITIVE NOTES. A
Global Note may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a
nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or
to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee
to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global
Notes shall be exchanged by the Company for Definitive Notes if (i) the Company
delivers to the Trustee notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or
unable to continue to act as Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing
agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor
Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the date of such
notice from the Depositary, (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines
that the Global Notes (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for
Definitive Notes and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee, or
(iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default or an Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes. Upon the occurrence of
either of the preceding events in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, Definitive Notes
shall be issued in such names as the Participants and Indirect Participants and
the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may be exchanged or
replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Sections 3.6 and 3.4 of the
Indenture. Every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu
of, a Global Note or any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.02 or
Section 3.6 or 3.4 of the Indenture, shall be authenticated and delivered in the
form of, and shall be, a Global Note. A Global Note may not be exchanged for
another Note other than as provided in this Section 2.02(a), however, beneficial
interests in a Global Note may be transferred and exchanged as provided in
Section 2.02(b), (c) or (f) of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture.

         (b) TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE GLOBAL NOTES.
The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Notes shall be

<PAGE>
accordance with the provisions of this Ninth Supplemental Indenture and
the Applicable Procedures. Beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Notes
shall be subject to restrictions on transfer comparable to those set forth in
this Ninth Supplemental Indenture to the extent required by the Securities Act.
Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes also shall require
compliance with either subparagraph (i) or (ii) below, as applicable, as well as
one or more of the other following subparagraphs, as applicable:

                (i) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Note.

         to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial
         interest in the same Restricted Global Note in accordance with the
         transfer restrictions set forth in the Private Placement Legend;
         provided, however, that prior to the expiration of the Restricted
         Period, transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global
         Note may not be made to a U.S. Person or for the account or benefit of
         a U.S. Person (other than an Initial Purchaser.) Beneficial interests
         in any Unrestricted Global Note may be transferred to Persons who take
         delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in an
         Unrestricted Global Note. No written orders or instructions shall be
         required to be delivered to the Registrar to effect the transfers
         described in this Section 2.02(b)(i).

                (ii) All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial Interests

         the transferor of such beneficial interest must deliver to the
         Registrar either (A)(1) a written order from a Participant or an
         Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the
         Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to credit or cause to be
         credited a beneficial interest in another Global Note in an amount
         equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged and (2)
         instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures
         containing information regarding the Participant account to be credited
         with such increase or (B)(1) a written order from a Participant or an
         Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the
         Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to cause to be issued a
         Definitive Note in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be
         transferred or exchanged and (2) instructions given by the Depositary
         to the Registrar containing information regarding the Person in whose
         name such Definitive Note shall be registered to effect the transfer or
         exchange referred to in (1) above. Upon consummation of an Exchange
         Offer by the Company in accordance with Section 2.02(f) of this Ninth
         Supplemental Indenture, the requirements of this Section 2.02(b)(ii)
         shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon receipt by the Registrar of
         the instructions contained in the Letter of Transmittal delivered by
         the Holder of such beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Notes.
         Upon satisfaction of all of the requirements for transfer or exchange
         of beneficial interests in Global Notes contained in this Ninth
         Supplemental Indenture and the Notes or otherwise applicable under the
         Securities Act, the Trustee shall adjust the principal amount of the
         relevant Global Note(s) pursuant to Section 2.02(h) of this Ninth
         Supplemental Indenture.

                pursuant to an Exchange Offer Registration Statement in
                accordance with the applicable Registration Rights Agreement; or

                         (D) the Registrar receives the following:

November 15, 2002 (together, the "Indenture"), each among the Company, the
Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the
Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S. Code ss.ss. 77aaa-77bbbb). The Notes
are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and
such Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note

Indenture shall govern and be controlling.

specified portion of the Securities.

         8. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be mailed no less

whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations
larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of

called for redemption.

things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the

majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time.

         12. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Events of Default include: (i) default for
30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (ii) default in
payment when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes when the same

<PAGE>
                                                                       EXHIBIT A

judgments for the payment of money that remain undischarged for a period of 60
days; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the
Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries. If any Event of Default (other than
an Event of Default of the type described in clause (vii) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from
certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes shall become
due and payable without further action or notice; provided, however, that after
such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes of such
issue may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if
all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, have
been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture. Holders may not enforce the
Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain
limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event
of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of
principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their
interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of
the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences
under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Company is required
to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any Default or
Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default
or Event of Default.

         13. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY. The Trustee, in its individual or
any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the
Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

         14. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
incorporator or stockholder, of the Company, as such, shall not have any
liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance
of the Notes.

         15. AUTHENTICATION. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by
the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

         16. ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a
Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

between the Company and the other parties thereto, relating to rights given by
the Company to the purchasers of any Additional Notes (collectively, the
"Registration Rights Agreement").

         18. CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused
CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use CUSIP numbers
in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made
as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers placed thereon.
