                                     SUMMARY

          The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more
detailed information contained in the Plan and elsewhere in this Disclosure
Statement. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings given to such terms in the Plan.

          Conseco, Inc. ("CNC") is the top tier holding company for our two
operating businesses: insurance and finance. Our insurance business is operated
through subsidiaries owned directly and indirectly by CIHC, Incorporated
("CIHC"), an intermediate holding company that is controlled by CNC. Our finance
business is operated through Conseco Finance Corp. ("CFC"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CIHC, and its subsidiaries. We sometimes collectively refer to
CNC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "Conseco" or the
"Company."

          Our insurance subsidiaries develop, market and administer supplemental
health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance
products. Our finance business has historically provided a variety of finance
products including manufactured housing and floor plan loans, home equity
mortgages, home improvement and consumer product loans and private label credit
cards.

          On December 17, 2002 (the "Petition Date"), CNC, CIHC, CTIHC, Inc. and
Partners Health Group, Inc. filed petitions under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The foregoing entities
are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Debtors" or the "Reorganizing
Debtors" and individually as a "Debtor" or a "Reorganizing Debtor" and, on or
after the Effective Date, together with New CNC, as the "Reorganized Debtors"
and individually as a "Reorganized Debtor."

          CFC and Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. also filed petitions under the
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District
of Illinois on the Petition Date. In addition, on February 3, 2003, the
following subsidiaries of CFC filed petitions under the Bankruptcy Code in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois: Conseco
Finance Corp. - Alabama, Conseco Finance Credit Corp., Conseco Finance Consumer
Discount Company, Conseco Finance Canada Holding Company, Conseco Finance Canada
Company, Conseco Finance Loan Company, Rice Park Properties Corporation,
Landmark Manufactured Housing, Inc., Conseco Finance Net Interest Margin Finance
Corp. I, Conseco Finance Net Interests Margin Finance Corp. II, Green Tree
Finance Corp. - Two, Green Tree Floorplan Funding Corp., Conseco Agency of
Nevada, Inc., Conseco Agency of New York, Inc., Conseco Agency, Inc., Conseco
Agency of Alabama, Inc., Conseco Agency of Kentucky, Inc., Crum-Reed General
Agency, Inc. The foregoing entities are sometimes referred to collectively as
the "Finance Company Debtors" and individually as a "Finance Company Debtor."
The Finance Company Debtors are not proponents of the Plan. The Finance Company
Debtors may file a separate plan and disclosure statement in connection with
their chapter 11 cases.

          This Disclosure Statement is being furnished by the Debtors as
proponents of the Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan," a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A), pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code
and in connection with the solicitation of votes (the "Solicitation") for the
acceptance or rejection of the Plan, as it may be amended or supplemented from
time to time in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules.

          This Disclosure Statement describes certain aspects of the Plan,
including the treatment of Holders of Claims against and Equity Interests in the
Debtors, and also describes certain aspects of the Company's operations, the
Company's projections and other related matters.

A.        Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases and Related Post-Petition
          Events

          Since commencing operations in 1982, CNC pursued a strategy of growth
through acquisitions. Primarily as a result of these acquisitions and the
funding requirements necessary to operate and expand the acquired businesses,
CNC amassed outstanding indebtedness of approximately $6.0 billion as of June
30, 2002. During the past two years, we undertook a series of steps designed to
reduce and extend the maturities of our parent company debt. Notwithstanding
these efforts, the Company's financial position continued to deteriorate,
principally due to our leveraged condition, losses experienced by our finance
business and losses in the value of our investment portfolio.

          As a result of these developments, on August 9, 2002, we announced
that we would seek to fundamentally restructure the Company's capital, and
announced that we had retained legal and financial advisors to assist us in
these efforts.

<PAGE>

          Shortly after our August 9 announcement, the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") halted trading in CNC's common stock and other listed securities, and
we experienced a number of ratings downgrades with respect to our outstanding
securities. In addition, we experienced a further downgrade with respect to the
financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and have been operating
under increased scrutiny from insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled.

          In October 2002, we announced that we had engaged financial advisors
to pursue various alternatives with respect to our finance business and that
CNC's board of directors had approved a plan to sell or seek new investors for
our finance business. On December 19, 2002, CFC entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with CFN Investment Holdings LLC
("CFN"), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC
and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., pursuant to which CFC would, subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, sell all or substantially all of its
assets (the "CFC Assets") in a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code as part of CFC's chapter 11 proceedings, subject to the right of CFN to
exclude certain assets from its purchase. In accordance with section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, CFC continued to
seek alternative transactions that would provide greater value to CFC and its
creditors than the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

          As part of CFC's efforts to seek alternative transactions that would
provide greater value to CFC, and in accordance with the bidding procedures
order approved by the Bankruptcy Court, CFC conducted an auction for the sale of
its businesses and assets. Potential bidders that submitted bids for the
purchase of the CFC Assets that, by their own terms or aggregated with other
bids, were for more than the purchase price payable under the Asset Purchase
Agreement, plus the amount of the break-up fee, plus $5 million, plus the profit
sharing rights relating to the manufactured housing business, were allowed to
participate in the auction. The auction, which commenced on February 28, 2003,
promptly adjourned, and was continued to March 4, 2003, ultimately concluding
the morning of March 5, 2003.

          Prior to and at the auction, CFC, with the assistance of its advisors,
analyzed each of the bids presented at the auction and determined that CFN's bid
of $970 million in cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, represented
the highest and best bid. The terms of the sale included an option for CFC to
sell the assets of Mill Creek Bank to General Electric Capital Corporation
("GE") for approximately $310 million in cash, plus certain assumed liabilities,
which option, if exercised, would provide CFN with a credit of $270 million to
its $970 million bid.

          On March 6, 2003, CFC received an offer from Berkadia Equity Holdings,
L.L.C. ("Berkadia") that purported to be a bid in the recently concluded
auction. Concurrently therewith, Berkadia filed an objection to the sale that
the Bankruptcy Court heard, and summarily dismissed, on March 7, 2003. After
further negotiations during the March 7-14, 2003 period, CFN and GE
significantly increased the amount of cash to be paid for the CFC Assets.
Ultimately, each of the major constituencies, including the CFC Committee, the
Ad Hoc Securitization Holders' Committee, U.S. Bank as securitization trustee
for the B-2 certificate holders, and Federal National Mortgage Association, as a
major B-2 certificate holder, agreed to support the sale of CFC Assets to CFN
and GE. The total value to be received as part of the transactions with CFN and
GE upon closing is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, representing
approximately $1.11 billion in cash and approximately $200 million in assumed
liabilities, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. On March 14, 2003,
the Bankruptcy Court entered orders approving the terms of the sale of the CFC
Assets free and clear of all liens to each of CFN and GE. The closing of the
sale of the CFC Assets is subject to various closing conditions, but is
currently expected to occur in May 2003.

B.        The Purpose of the Plan

          The purpose of the Plan is to provide the Company with a capital
structure that can be supported by cash flows from operations. To this end, the
Plan will reduce CNC's debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations by more
than $5.0 billion and its future annual interest expense and distributions on
Trust Preferred Securities by approximately $380 million. The Debtors believe
that the reorganization contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of
their creditors as a whole. If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors believe
that they will be forced to either file an alternate plan of reorganization or
liquidate under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In either event, the Debtors
believe that the Company's unsecured creditors (including the holders of public
debt) would realize a less favorable distribution of value, or, in certain
cases, none at all, for their Claims. See Section II.I hereof and the
Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto.

                                      -2-

C.        Treatment of Claims and Equity Interests

          The Plan is comprised of four Subplans. The tables set forth below
summarize the Classes of Claims and Equity Interests under each Subplan,
projected aggregate amounts of such Classes, the treatment of such Classes, and
the projected recoveries of such Classes under the Plan. The amounts in the
column entitled "Projected Claims/Equity Interests" represent amounts
outstanding on the Petition Date.(2) The projected recoveries (if the Plan is
approved) are based upon certain assumptions contained in the Valuation Analysis
developed by Lazard Freres & Co. LLC set forth in Section II.J hereof.

          Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Lenders will receive (x) New
Tranche A Bank Debt and New Tranche B Bank Debt (together, the "New Bank Debt"),
(y) New CNC Preferred Stock and (z) New CNC Warrants in respect of their claims
for principal and interest through the Effective Date ("Total Bank Debt
Balance"). In the context of a consensual plan, the Lenders' distribution are
intended to reflect their structural seniority to creditors of CNC by virtue of
their claims against CIHC, as well as contractual subordination provisions
requiring the Lenders be paid in full in cash prior to any distributions in
respect of any Exchange Note Claims and other contractually subordinated Claims.
In addition, certain of the Lender Claims are secured by various collateral,
including a pledge of the stock of CIHC and certain intercompany notes, on a
pari passu basis with the 93/94 Note Claims. In the context of a consensual
Plan, the Holders of Claims subordinated to the Lender Claims would receive the
recoveries set forth in the Plan even in the absence of the payment in full in
cash of the Lender Claims on the Effective Date.

          As set forth in Section II.J below, "General Information -- Financial
Projections and Liquidation Analysis," New CNC's enterprise value is estimated
to be approximately $3.8 billion. Accordingly, the estimated value of the New
CNC Common Stock is equal to New CNC's estimated enterprise value less the Total
Bank Debt Balance (the "Equity Value").

          Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, New CNC Common Stock will be
distributed to holders of (i) Class 6B Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims against CIHC, (ii) Class 6A Exchange Note Claims (on account of such
Claims and their related Class 5B Exchange Note Claims), (iii) Class 7A Original
Note Claims, (iv) Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against
CNC, (v) Class 10A Trust Related Claims and (vi) Class 11A-1 Old CNC Preferred
Stock Interests. In addition, the Holders of Class 4A 93/94 Note Claims may
receive New CNC Common Stock. As discussed below, Holders of Class 6B Claims and
Class 5B Claims have Claims against CIHC which are structurally senior to all
Claims against CNC. Holders of 93/94 Note Claims have Claims against CNC which
are secured by various collateral, including a pledge of the stock of CIHC. As a
result of such pledge, the 93/94 Note Claims are senior to all other Claims
solely against CNC to the extent of the value of this pledge.

          As discussed below, under the compromise embodied by the Plan, the
Holders of Claims at the CNC level are receiving not only more than they would
receive in a liquidation of the Debtors, they are also receiving more than they
would have received pursuant to a chapter 11 plan that strictly applied
contractual and structural subordination principles (the "Absolute Priority
Alternative").

          Under the Plan, Holders of Class 6B Claims (Reorganizing Debtor
General Unsecured Claims against CIHC) will receive shares of New CNC Common
Stock representing their Pro Rata share of the Equity Value. The Holders of
93/94 Note Claims will receive either New Senior Notes or New CNC Common Stock
having an Equity Value equal to the Allowed amount of such 93/94 Note Claims as
described in the Class 4A Notice, which will be mailed 30 days before the Voting
Deadline.

          Holders of Exchange Note Claims, by virtue of their Class 5B Exchange
Note Claims, under an Absolute Priority Alternative, would be entitled to
receive distributions equal in value to the full amount of their Allowed Claims
before any value would be distributed to CNC (or any Holders of Claims against
CNC) as a result of CNC's equity ownership of CIHC. However, under the Plan,
Holders of Class 6A Exchange Note Claims and the related Class 5B Exchange Note
Claims will allow value to be distributed to Holders of Claims against CNC in an
amount that is significantly greater than the value such claimants would be
entitled to receive in an Absolute Priority Alternative. Such value is being
provided to the Holders of Claims against CNC to ensure that the Debtors'
reorganization efforts are completed consensually and as expeditiously as
possible. In addition, such recovery is also being provided to the Holders of
Claims against CNC in full

--------------------
2    The amounts in the tables below assume an Effective Date of June 1, 2003
     and do not give effect to (i) dilution from exercise of the New CNC
     Warrants, equity that may be issued pursuant to the equity incentive plan
     or equity that may be issued to certain professionals involved with the
     Debtors' restructuring efforts pursuant to their engagement letters, and
     (ii) any postpetition interest claim that Holders of Exchange Note Claims
     may be entitled to under the Bankruptcy Code.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

and complete settlement of any claims or Causes of Actions that may exist with
respect to the Claims against CIHC (including, without limitation, any claims or
causes of action related to the Class 5B Exchange Note Claims).

          Specifically, under the Plan, instead of the Exchange Note Claims
being paid in full prior to any distribution to the Holders of Claims against
CNC, the Exchange Note Claims will share the recovery they would be entitled to
on a pro rata basis at the CIHC level, together with any remaining Equity Value,
with the Original Note Claims, and the Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims against CNC on a pro rata basis; provided that for purposes of such pro
rata allocation, (i) the amount of the Exchange Note Claims will be increased by
a multiple of 1.7 to partially reflect their structural seniority, (ii) the
amount of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against CNC is assumed to
be $140 million and (iii) the amount of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims against CIHC is assumed to be at least $60 million. In addition, the
distributions to the Holders of the Exchange Note Claims and the Original Note
Claims reflects the benefit of the contractual subordination to which such
Claims are entitled with respect to the Trust Related Claims. Specifically,
under the Plan, the recoveries that the Trust Related Claims may have been
entitled to, but for the contractual subordination provisions to which they are
subject, are distributed in the manner set forth in the Plan to the Holders of
Exchange Note Claims and Original Note Claims. The Holders of Class 8A
Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims are not subject to such contractual
subordination.

          The distribution to the Holders of Lender Claims reflects the benefits
of contractual subordination set forth in the Senior Credit Facility and the D&O
Credit Facilities. Specifically, under the Plan, the Total Bank Debt Balance
upon which Holders of Lender Claims receive their distributions includes
postpetition interest. The subordination language with respect to the Exchange
Notes provides that Holders of the Lender Claims will receive postpetition
interest. The amount of postpetition interest paid to the Lenders proportionally
reduces the recovery to the Holders of Exchange Note Claims and Holders of
Claims against CNC (who would not receive the recovery provided for under the
Plan if not for the consent of the Holders of the Exchange Notes). The
recoveries by Holders of Class 6B (Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
against CIHC) and 93/94 Notes will not be affected by the payment of
postpetition interest to the Lenders.

          The formulation above results in a significantly higher recovery to
Holders of certain Claims against CNC than such Holders would receive in an
Absolute Priority Alternative. In an Absolute Priority Alternative, Holders of
(w) the Exchange Note Claims would receive a recovery of approximately 100%, (x)
Original Note Claims would receive a recovery of approximately 11.5%, (y)
Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against CNC would receive a
recovery of no more than approximately 4.4%, (z) Trust Related Claims would not
receive a recovery due to contractual subordination provisions in the relevant
prepetition documents governing the Trust Preferred Securities, which require
the Holders of Trust Related Claims to contribute their recovery to the Holders
of Original Note Claims and Exchange Note Claims. The distributions under the
Plan are set forth in the tables below. These recoveries are based on
Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against CIHC being no less than $60
million and Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against CNC being $140
million. To the extent that the Allowed amount of Reorganizing Debtor General
Unsecured Claims against CIHC exceeds $60 million, all recoveries to the Holders
of the Exchange Notes, Original Notes, and the Reorganizing Debtor General
Unsecured Claims against CNC would be reduced. To the extent that the Allowed
amount of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against CNC (i) exceeds
$140 million, the recoveries to the Holders of such Reorganizing Debtor General
Unsecured Claims would be reduced proportionately (the recoveries to the Holders
of Exchange Note Claims and Original Note Claims would not be reduced) or (ii)
are less than $140 million, the recoveries to Holders of such Reorganizing
Debtor General Unsecured Claims would be increased proportionately (the
recoveries to the Holders of Exchange Note Claims and Original Note Claims would
not be increased).

-----------------------
3    A contractual subordination provision in the indentures governing the
     Exchange Notes requires that the Lender Claims be paid in full before the
     Exchange Notes receive any recovery from the Debtors. Pursuant to this
     provision, the Total Bank Debt Balance includes postpetition interest,
     notwithstanding that Lender Claims are partially unsecured. In addition,
     under the Plan, the Holders of Exchange Note Claims will allow value to be
     distributed to the Holders of certain junior Claims against CNC.
     Accordingly, the Exchange Note Distribution will yield less than full
     recovery to Class 5B.

4    Because Class 6B Claims are not contractually subordinated to the Lender
     Claims, the CIHC Unsecured Distribution is not reduced by virtue of
     postpetition interest being included in the Total Bank Debt Balance.

D.        Voting and Confirmation

          Each Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest in Classes 4A, 5A-1, 5A-2,
6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1, 4B-1, 4B-2, 5B, 6B and 3C is entitled to vote either to
accept or reject the Plan. Classes 4A, 5A-1, 5A-2, 6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 4B-1, 4B-2,
5B, 6B and 3C shall have accepted the Plan if (i) the Holders of at least
two-thirds in dollar amount of the Allowed Claims actually voting in each such
Class have voted to accept the Plan and (ii) the Holders of more than one-half
in number of the Allowed Claims actually voting in each such Class have voted to
accept the Plan. Class 11A-1 shall be deemed to have accepted the Plan if the
Holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Allowed Equity Interests
actually voting in such Class have voted to accept the Plan. Assuming the
requisite acceptances are obtained, the Debtors intend to seek confirmation of
the Plan at the Confirmation Hearing (as defined in Article VII.D herein)
scheduled for May 28, 2003, before the Bankruptcy Court. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Debtors will seek Confirmation of the Plan under section 1129(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Impaired Classes presumed to reject
the Plan, and reserve the right to do so with respect to any other rejecting
Class or to modify the Plan in accordance with Article XII.E of the Plan.

          Article VII of this Disclosure Statement specifies the deadlines,
procedures and instructions for voting to accept or reject the Plan and the
applicable standards for tabulating Ballots. The Bankruptcy Court has
established March 19, 2003 (the "Voting Record Date") as the date for
determining which Holders of Claims and Equity Interests are eligible to vote on
the Plan. Ballots will be mailed to all registered Holders of Claims or Equity
Interests as of the Voting Record Date that are entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan. An appropriate return envelope will be included with your
Ballot, if necessary. Beneficial Holders of Claims or Equity Interests who
receive a return envelope addressed to their bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee (or its agent) (each, a "Nominee") should allow sufficient time for
their votes to be received by the Nominee and processed on a Master Ballot
before the Voting Deadline, as defined below.

          The Debtors have engaged the Solicitation Agent to assist in the
voting process. The Solicitation Agent will answer questions, provide additional
copies of all materials and oversee the voting tabulation. The Solicitation
Agent will also process and tabulate ballots for each Class entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan. The Solicitation Agent is Bankruptcy Management
Corporation, 1330 E. Franklin Avenue, El Segundo, CA 90245, (888) 909-0100 (toll
free).

          TO BE COUNTED, YOUR BALLOT (OR MASTER BALLOT OF YOUR NOMINEE HOLDER)
INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
SOLICITATION AGENT NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M., CENTRAL TIME, ON MAY 14, 2003 (THE
"VOTING DEADLINE"), UNLESS THE BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDS OR WAIVES THE PERIOD
DURING WHICH VOTES WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE DEBTORS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM
"VOTING DEADLINE" FOR SUCH SOLICITATION SHALL MEAN THE LAST TIME AND DATE TO
WHICH SUCH SOLICITATION IS EXTENDED. ANY EXECUTED BALLOT OR COMBINATION OF
BALLOTS REPRESENTING CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE SAME CLASS OR SUBCLASS
HELD BY THE SAME HOLDER THAT DOES NOT INDICATE EITHER AN ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION
OF THE PLAN OR THAT INDICATES BOTH AN ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION OF THE PLAN SHALL
BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN. ANY BALLOT RECEIVED AFTER THE
VOTING DEADLINE MAY NOT BE COUNTED IN THE DISCRETION OF THE DEBTORS.

          THE DEBTORS BELIEVE THAT THE PLAN IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL OF
THEIR CREDITORS AS A WHOLE. THE DEBTORS RECOMMEND THAT ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
AGAINST AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS WHOSE VOTES ARE BEING SOLICITED
SUBMIT BALLOTS TO ACCEPT THE PLAN.

E.        Consummation of the Plan

          Following Confirmation of the Plan, the Plan will be consummated on
the date selected by the Debtors which is a business day after the Confirmation
Date on which (a) no stay of the Confirmation Order is in effect, and (b) all
conditions to consummation of the Plan have been (i) satisfied or (ii) waived
(the "Effective Date"). Distributions to be made under the Plan will be made on
or as soon after the Effective Date as practicable.

F.        Risk Factors

          Prior to deciding whether and how to vote on the Plan, each Holder of
Impaired Claims and Impaired Equity Interests should consider carefully all of
the information in this Disclosure Statement, especially the Risk Factors
contained in Article VIII hereof.

          The following section of this Summary sets forth the views of the
TOPrS Committee with respect to certain matters contained in this Disclosure
Statement. This language has been written by the TOPrS Committee and is included
herein at the request of the TOPrS Committee. Although the Debtors strongly
disagree with many of the allegations contained in the TOPrS Committee's
statement below, the Debtors have agreed to include it herein in order to
respond to certain objections raised by the TOPrS Committee with respect to this
Disclosure Statement and to facilitate an expeditious resolution of the
Company's restructuring.

G.        The Position of THE TOPrS Committee with respect to Certain Matters in
          this Disclosure Statement


   READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE TOPrS COMMITTEE'S POSITION, WHICH IN
               MATERIAL RESPECTS DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE DEBTORS.


I.        INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND


          A.   The Conseco Arrangement To Issue TOPrS


          In 1996, Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") confected a complicated financing
arrangement in order to raise money from the public. Pursuant to that
arrangement, Conseco issued an indenture (as supplemented from time to time, the
"Base Indenture"), which provided for the issuance of debt securities in
multiple series (the "Debentures"). Over a three-year period beginning in
November 1996, Conseco issued six (6) series of Debentures with various interest
rates and due dates, raising approximately $2 billion for Conseco. Conseco
caused each series of Debentures to be sold to separate business trusts (the
"Trusts"). In order to fund the purchase of the Debentures, Conseco effectuated
the Trusts' issuance of both preferred and common trust securities (the "Trust
Securities"). Conseco purchased the common Trust Securities and caused the
preferred Trust Securities to be sold to the public (to the "TOPrS") in
underwritten public offerings.


          State Street, as successor trustee to Fleet National Bank, serves as
the Property and Indenture Trustee (the "Trustee") for the Trusts.


          B.   The TOPrS Committee


          On January 3, 2003, the Office of the United States Trustee appointed
the TOPrS Committee. The TOPrS Committee represents the interests of the TOPrS
whose claims in the aggregate amount to approximately $2.1 billion. The members
of the TOPrS Committee are: United Capital Markets, Inc.; Oppenheimer Capital;
and Paul Floto.


          C.   The Prepetition Negotiations Did Not Include the TOPrS


          In October 2002, prior to the filing of these bankruptcy cases,
Conseco commenced discussions with certain holders of the TOPrS Debt, who were
formally recognized as an Ad Hoc Committee (the "TOPrS Ad Hoc Committee"). The
members of the TOPrS Ad Hoc Committee were United Capital Markets; Oppenheimer
Capital; Marion Polk Real Estate (a real estate services business owned by Paul
Floto); and Smith Hayes Financial Services. Saul Ewing LLP served as the legal
advisor to the Ad Hoc Committee, while Raymond James served as the financial
advisor to the Ad Hoc Committee.


          Prior to filing its bankruptcy cases, Conseco entered into
negotiations with its Prepetition Bank Committee and Prepetition Noteholder
Committee regarding the terms of a consensual restructuring of Conseco's debt
obligations. The TOPrS Ad Hoc Committee was specifically excluded from such
negotiations. Although the Debtors did meet once, with the TOPrS Ad Hoc
Committee representatives, the Debtors did not enter into negotiations with such
Committee.


II.       INFORMATION THE TOPrS COMMITTEE BELIEVES IS MATERIAL FOR CREDITORS TO
          CONSIDER


          A.   The Value of Conseco's Assets


          The TOPrS Committee believes the reorganized Conseco will have a value
which is significantly greater than the $3.8 billion enterprise value suggested
by the Debtors and their financial and investment banking advisor, Lazard.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
          If the Court determines that the value of New CNC is substantially
greater than $3.8 billion, the Plan may not be confirmable. Based on information
previously reviewed by the TOPrS Committee, the TOPrS Committee believes that
New CNC does have a value substantially above $3.8 billion. The TOPrS
Committee's financial advisors and valuation experts are in the process of
performing their own independent analyses of the value of New CNC. As of the
date of this Disclosure Statement their work has not yet been concluded.

          In addition to the value of the Debtors' insurance business, property
of the bankruptcy estates also includes the following assets, to which the
Debtors ascribe no value.

               o    Tax Refunds and Cash - Conseco holds interests in tax
                    refunds and certain cash, but fails to disclose the amount
                    or value of such interests.

               o    Causes of Action - The Debtors hold certain claims or causes
                    of actions against others, including claims against current
                    and former officers and directors of Conseco or its
                    affiliated companies. In particular, during the period 1997
                    to 2000 Conseco paid in excess of $700 million in cash and
                    noncash compensation and other benefits to the top dozen
                    officers of Conseco. Two of the officers, Stephen Hilbert
                    and Rollin Dick, received over $360 million in cash and
                    noncash compensation and other benefits during that
                    four-year period. The excessive compensation and staggering
                    benefits paid to Conseco's officers raises questions as to
                    whether claims may be asserted against the insiders for self
                    dealing, abuse of their positions, and/or breaches of
                    fiduciary duties. The Debtors fail to disclose the value of
                    the claims it is releasing, let alone whether it has
                    investigated such claims. The TOPrS Committee believes that
                    the claims to be released against insiders represent another
                    significant source of recovery to the TOPrS's interests.
                    Conseco does not ascribe any value to any such claims or
                    causes of action. The TOPrS Committee believes these claims
                    or causes of action could result in substantial recoveries
                    for the benefit of creditors.

               o    Claims under the D&O Loan Facilities - Beginning in 1996,
                    certain officers and directors of Conseco personally
                    borrowed money to purchase the common stock of Conseco under
                    credit facilities provided by Bank of America, N.A., JP
                    Morgan Chase Bank and various other lending institutions
                    (the "D&O Facilities"). Conseco guaranteed the personal
                    loans of its officers and directors under the D&O
                    Facilities. The principal amount due and owing under the D&O
                    Facilities currently exceeds $483 million. In addition to
                    the principal amounts still owed to the lending banks, the
                    directors and officers also owe Conseco and/or its
                    affiliates certain amounts under the D&O Facilities for the
                    amounts paid by Conseco and/or its affiliates to the lending
                    banks under the D&O Facilities. The Plan proposes to pay the
                    amounts due and owing under the D&O Facilities directly to
                    the lending banks. The Plan also proposes to release certain
                    of the directors and officers from any responsibility to
                    repay the amounts borrowed under the D&O Facilities. Conseco
                    fails to provide the total dollar amount of the claims
                    Conseco is releasing against the directors and officers.
                    Conseco also fails to disclose the total dollar amount
                    Conseco expects to recover under the D&O Facilities from the
                    directors and officers. The TOPrS Committee believes the D&O
                    Facilities represent another significant source of recovery.

               o    Releases Of Undisclosed Claims Against Insiders and
                    Professionals - The Plan provides for Conseco to grant broad
                    releases to various insiders and professionals employed by
                    Conseco as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy
                    petition or thereafter. The professionals include lawyers,
                    accountants, financial advisors, investment bankers and
                    other advisors, all of whom may have contributed to
                    Conseco's financial problems. In fact, the TOPrS Committee
                    understands that the Securities and Exchange Commission is
                    investigating possible accounting irregularities at Conseco.
                    Conseco fails to disclose what investigation, if any, it has
                    conducted in regard to the claims against any such
                    professionals. The TOPrS Committee believes the claims to be
                    released represent another significant source of recovery to
                    the estate.

          B.   Benefits To Insiders


          The TOPrS Committee believes that it is important for creditors voting
on the Plan to be informed about the enormous benefits to be enjoyed under the
Plan by Conseco's insiders-- particularly their officers and directors. These
benefits include the following:

               o    The Improper Releases and Indemnities -- A key component of
                    the Plan is the releases that will be given to Conseco's
                    directors and officers, as well as the releases that will be
                    provided to other third parties, if serving in such capacity
                    as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition or
                    thereafter. If allowed, no relief could ever be sought
                    against any of these persons, including claims for any
                    misconduct such as breach of fiduciary duty or insider
                    self-dealing.

               o    Broad Indemnification of Current Officers and Directors --
                    Under the Plan, current officers and directors will be
                    indemnified by New CNC for acts occurring before and after
                    the filing of the bankruptcy. The amount of the potential
                    liabilities proposed to be indemnified by New CNC could be
                    significant. The Debtors have not identified the amount of
                    potential liability under the proposed indemnification.

               o    Assumption of Compensation and Benefit Plans -- The Debtors
                    will assume under the Plan existing compensation and benefit
                    plans, without disclosing the amount of liabilities being so
                    assumed.

               o    Settlement of Claims under the D&O Credit Facilities -- Many
                    officers, directors and key employees, current and former,
                    would be released from any obligations to pay Conseco for
                    amounts borrowed by them under the D&O Credit Facilities.

               o    Other Benefits -- As disclosed elsewhere under this
                    Disclosure Statement, the Debtors propose under the Plan to
                    assume and maintain all insurance policies for directors and
                    officers' liability for a period of ten years. There can be
                    no certainty as to what the cost of maintaining such
                    insurance would be.

               o    Management Stock Options -- The Plan provides that
                    management of New CNC may receive up to 10% of new common
                    stock of New CNC. This is ten times the amount of the stock
                    that the TOPrS would receive under the Plan in the event
                    that the TOPrS were to vote to accept the Plan. (If the
                    TOPrS vote to reject the Plan, they receive nothing.)

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

A.        DESCRIPTION OF CONSECO'S BUSINESS

          1.   Corporate Structure

          CNC is the top tier holding company for our two operating businesses:
insurance and finance. Our insurance business is operated through subsidiaries
owned directly and indirectly by CIHC, an intermediate holding company that is
controlled by CNC. Our finance business is operated through CFC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CIHC, and its subsidiaries. An organizational chart of CNC and its
subsidiaries as of the Petition Date is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

          2.   The Company's Business

Insurance Business
------------------

          Our insurance subsidiaries develop, market and administer supplemental
health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance
products. We sell these products through three primary distribution channels:
career agents, professional independent producers and direct marketing. We had
over $5.4 billion of annual premium and asset accumulation product collections
during 2001 and $3.7 billion of collections during the nine months ended
September 30, 2002.

          Supplemental health products include Medicare supplement, long-term
care and specified-disease insurance products. During 2001, we collected
Medicare supplement premiums of $975.1 million, long-term care premiums of
$888.3 million, specified-disease premiums of $371.8 million, and other
supplemental health premiums of $109.3 million. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2002, we collected Medicare supplement premiums of $759.0 million,
long-term care premiums of $680.4 million, specified-disease premiums of $276.4
million, and other supplemental health premiums of $78.6 million. Supplemental
health premiums represented 49% of our total premiums collected from continuing
lines of business in 2001 and 54% of our total premiums collected from
continuing lines of business during the first nine months of 2002.

          Annuity products include equity-indexed annuity, traditional fixed
rate annuity and market value-adjusted annuity products. During 2001, we
collected annuity premiums of $1,223.7 million, or 26% of our total premiums
collected from continuing lines of business. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2002, we collected annuity premiums of $804.1 million, or 24% of
our total premiums collected from continuing lines of business.

          Life products include traditional life, universal life and other life
insurance products. During 2001, we collected life product premiums of $839.6
million, or 18% of our total premiums collected from continuing lines of
business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, we collected life
product premiums of $483.9 million, or 15% of our total premiums collected from
continuing lines of business.

          Conseco Capital Management, Inc. ("CCM"), a registered investment
advisor and wholly owned subsidiary of CNC, manages the investment portfolios of
our insurance subsidiaries. CCM had approximately $26.8 billion of assets (at
fair value) under management at September 30, 2002, of which $22.0 billion were
assets of Conseco's subsidiaries, $3.9 billion were assets held by registered
and structured products and $0.9 billion were assets owned by other parties. Our
investment philosophy is to maintain a largely investment-grade fixed-income
portfolio, provide adequate liquidity for expected liability durations and other
requirements and maximize total return through active investment management. As
of September 30, 2002, the average yield of our portfolio of fixed maturity
securities, computed on the cost basis, was approximately 6.9%. We are subject
to the risk that our investments will decline in value. This has occurred in the
past and may occur again. During the first nine months of 2002, we recognized
net realized investment losses of $524.9 million, compared to net realized
investment losses of $302.7 million during the comparable period of 2001. The
net realized investment losses during the first nine months of 2002 included:
(i) $489.8 million of writedowns of fixed maturity investments, equity

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

securities and other invested assets as a result of conditions which caused us
to conclude a decline in fair value of the investment was other than temporary
and (ii) $35.1 million of net losses from the sales of investments (primarily
fixed maturities) which generated proceeds of $15.6 billion.

          In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold Conseco Variable Insurance
Company, a company engaged in the variable annuity business. During 2001, we
decided to discontinue a large block of major medical business by non-renewal of
policies because such business was not profitable. Unless otherwise noted, the
foregoing financial information and other financial information in this
Disclosure Statement excludes amounts related to the business of Conseco
Variable Insurance Company that was sold and the Company's major medical line of
business that is no longer being sold and is not being renewed by the Company
when the contractual terms of the existing insurance policies expire.

Finance Business
----------------

          Our finance business has historically provided a variety of finance
products, including manufactured housing and floor plan loans, home equity
mortgages, home improvement and consumer product loans and private label credit
cards. At September 30, 2002, we had managed receivables of $38.2 billion.

          CFC has historically provided financing for consumer purchases of
manufactured housing and floor plan loans to manufactured housing dealers. A
manufactured home is a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
designed to be a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation. During 2001,
we originated $2.5 billion of consumer contracts for manufactured housing
purchases, or 22% of our total finance company originations, and $2.1 billion of
floor plan loans. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables included $23.9
billion of contracts for manufactured housing purchases, or 63% of total managed
receivables, and $0.2 billion of floor plan loans. On November 25, 2002, CFC
discontinued the origination of manufactured housing loans as a result of CFC's
recent funding constraints and the unprofitable nature of these loans under
CFC's current financial condition and prevailing market conditions.

          Mortgage services products include home equity and home improvement
loans. During 2001, we originated $3.0 billion of contracts for these products,
or 27% of our total originations. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables
included $10.0 billion of contracts for home equity and home improvement loans,
or 26% of total managed receivables. During 2001, we originated $3.6 billion of
private label credit card receivables, primarily through our bank subsidiaries,
or 32% of our total originations. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables
included $2.9 billion of contracts for credit card loans, or 7% of total managed
receivables. Private label credit card programs are offered to select retailers
with a core focus on the home improvement industry. At September 30, 2002, we
offered consumer finance products through 90 home equity offices, approximately
1,280 home improvement dealers and approximately 3,700 private label retail
outlets.

          As described in "Planned Sale of CFC," we have agreed to sell all or
substantial portions of our finance business.

Government Regulation
---------------------

          Our insurance and finance subsidiaries are subject to extensive
regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they operate. This
regulation and supervision is primarily for the benefit and protection of our
customers and policyholders, and not for the benefit of our investors or
creditors.

          Insurance

          State laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad
regulatory authority, including the power to: (i) grant and revoke business
licenses; (ii) regulate and supervise trade practices and market conduct; (iii)
establish guaranty associations; (iv) license agents; (v) approve policy forms;
(vi) approve premium rates for some lines of business; (vii) establish reserve
requirements; (viii) prescribe the form and content of required financial
statements and reports; (ix) determine the reasonableness and adequacy of
statutory capital and surplus; (x) perform financial, market conduct and other
examinations; (xi) define

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

acceptable accounting principles; (xii) regulate the type and amount of
permitted investments; and (xiii) limit the amount of dividends and surplus
debenture payments that can be paid without obtaining regulatory approval.

          Since the August 9, 2002 announcement of our restructuring efforts, we
have been working closely with insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, New
York, Pennsylvania and Texas) in connection with their monitoring of the
operations and financial status of our insurance subsidiaries. The Commissioner
of Insurance for the State of Texas has acted as the lead regulator among these
states and has coordinated the oversight and monitoring efforts associated with
our financial restructuring.

          On October 30, 2002, Bankers National Life Insurance Company and
Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), our two insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas, each entered
into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas.
See "Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases and Related Post-Petition Events --
Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues" for a more complete discussion of the
heightened regulatory scrutiny we have experienced in connection with our
restructuring.

          In addition to the limitations imposed by the laws described above and
the Texas consent orders, most states have also enacted laws or regulations with
respect to the activities of insurance holding company systems, including
payment of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by insurance companies, the
terms of transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates, and
other related matters. Various notice and reporting requirements generally apply
to transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates within an
insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the
transactions. These requirements may include prior regulatory approval or prior
notice for certain material transactions. Currently, the Company and its
insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to
such laws and regulations in the domiciliary states of the insurance
subsidiaries, and they routinely report to other jurisdictions.

          Most states have also enacted legislation or adopted administrative
regulations that affect the acquisition (or sale) of control of insurance
companies. The nature and extent of such legislation and regulations vary from
state to state. Generally, these regulations require an acquirer of control to
file detailed information concerning such acquirer and the plan of acquisition,
and to obtain administrative approval prior to the acquisition of control.
"Control" is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is rebuttably
presumed to exist if a person or group of affiliated persons directly or
indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another
person.

          The affiliated party transaction and change of control laws and
regulations described in the preceding two paragraphs may require notices to
and/or prior approvals by certain of our insurance regulators before the Plan of
Reorganization may be consummated. The specific required filings, notices and
approvals have not yet been determined, but are expected to be made or obtained
concurrently with the other voting and confirmation procedures required for the
Plan of Reorganization. See "Voting and Confirmation Procedure."

          On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state
regulators annually, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
("NAIC") calculates certain financial ratios to assist state regulators in
monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. A "usual range" of
results for each ratio is used as a benchmark. In the past, variances in certain
ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have resulted in inquiries from insurance
departments, to which we have responded. Such inquiries did not lead to any
restrictions affecting our operations.

          In addition, the NAIC issues model laws and regulations, many of which
have been adopted by state insurance regulators, relating to: (i) investment
reserve requirements; (ii) risk-based capital ("RBC") standards; (iii)
codification of insurance accounting principles; (iv) additional investment
restrictions; (v) restrictions on an insurance company's ability to pay
dividends; and (vi) product illustrations. The RBC Model Act provides for
different levels of regulatory attention based on the ratio of an insurance
company's

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital, surplus,
asset valuation reserve and certain other adjustments) to its required RBC (such
ratio is referred to herein as the "RBC ratio"). RBC standards are designed to
help identify insurance companies which are undercapitalized and require
specific regulatory actions in the event an insurer's RBC ratio falls below
specified levels.

          Most states mandate minimum benefit standards and loss ratios for
accident and health insurance policies. We are generally required to maintain,
with respect to our individual long-term care policies, minimum anticipated loss
ratios over the entire period of coverage of not less than 60 percent. With
respect to our Medicare supplement policies, we are generally required to attain
and maintain an actual loss ratio, after three years, of not less than 65
percent. We provide to the insurance departments of all states in which we
conduct business annual calculations that demonstrate compliance with required
minimum loss ratios for both long-term care and Medicare supplement insurance.
These calculations are prepared utilizing statutory lapse and interest rate
assumptions. In the event that we fail to maintain minimum mandated loss ratios,
our insurance subsidiaries could be required to provide retrospective refunds
and/or prospective rate reductions. We believe that our insurance subsidiaries
currently comply with all applicable mandated minimum loss ratios.

          During recent years, the health insurance industry has experienced
substantial changes, including those caused by healthcare legislation. Recent
federal and state legislation and legislative proposals relating to healthcare
reform contain features that could severely limit or eliminate our ability to
vary our pricing terms or apply medical underwriting standards with respect to
individuals which could have the effect of increasing our loss ratios and
adversely affecting our financial results. In particular, Medicare reform and
legislation concerning prescription drugs could affect our ability to price or
sell our products.

          In addition, proposals currently pending in Congress and some state
legislatures may also affect our financial results. These proposals include the
implementation of minimum consumer protection standards for inclusion in all
long-term care policies, including: guaranteed premium rates; protection against
inflation; limitations on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions; setting
standards for sales practices for long-term care insurance; and guaranteed
consumer access to information about insurers, including lapse and replacement
rates for policies and the percentage of claims denied. Enactment of any of
these proposals could affect our financial results.

          The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued
regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
("HIPAA") relating to standardized electronic transaction formats, code sets and
the privacy of member health information. These regulations and any
corresponding state legislation will affect the Company's administration of
health insurance.

          A number of states have passed or are considering legislation that
would limit the differentials in rates that insurers could charge for health
care coverages between new business and renewal business for similar demographic
groups. State legislation has also been adopted or is being considered that
would make health insurance available to all small groups by requiring coverage
of all employees and their dependents, by limiting the applicability of
pre-existing conditions exclusions, by requiring insurers to offer a basic plan
exempt from certain benefits as well as a standard plan, or by establishing a
mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees to all small group insurers.
Congress and various state legislators have from time to time proposed changes
to the health care system that could affect the relationship between health
insurers and their customers, including external review. We cannot predict with
certainty the effect that any proposals, if adopted, or legislative developments
could have on our insurance business.

          The asset management activities of CCM are subject to federal and
state securities, fiduciary (including ERISA) and other laws and regulations.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, state securities commissions and the Department of Labor are the
principal regulators of our asset management operations.

          Finance

          Our finance operations are subject to regulation by certain federal
and state regulatory authorities. A substantial portion of our consumer loans
and assigned sales contracts are originated or purchased by

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

finance subsidiaries licensed under applicable state law. The licensed entities
are subject to examination by, and reporting requirements of, the state
administrative agencies issuing these licenses. Our finance subsidiaries are
subject to state laws and regulations, which in certain states: (i) limit the
amount, duration and charges for such loans and contracts; (ii) require
disclosure of certain loan terms and regulate the content of documentation;
(iii) place limitations on collection practices; and (iv) govern creditor
remedies. The licenses granted are renewable and may be subject to revocation by
the respective issuing authority for violation of such state's laws and
regulations. Some states have adopted or are considering the adoption of
consumer protection laws or regulations that impose requirements or restrictions
on lenders who make certain types of loans secured by real estate.

          In addition to the finance companies licensed under state law, Mill
Creek Bank, Inc. ("Mill Creek Bank", formerly known as Conseco Bank, Inc.) and
Green Tree Retail Services Bank, Inc. ("Retail Bank"), both of which are wholly
owned subsidiaries of CFC, are regulated and subject to examination by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mill Creek Bank is also regulated and
examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Retail Bank is also
supervised and examined by the South Dakota Department of Banking. The ownership
of these entities does not subject the Company to regulation by the Federal
Reserve Board as a bank holding company. Mill Creek Bank has the authority to
engage generally in the banking business and may accept all types of deposits,
other than demand deposits. Retail Bank is limited by its charter to engage in
the credit card business and may issue only certificates of deposit in
denominations of $100,000 or greater. Mill Creek Bank and Retail Bank are
subject to regulations relating to capital adequacy, leverage, loans, loss
reserves, deposits, consumer protection, community reinvestment, payment of
dividends and transactions with affiliates.

          A number of states have usury and other consumer protection laws which
may place limitations on the amount of interest and other charges and fees
charged on loans originated in such state. Generally, state law has been
preempted by federal law under the Depositary Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980 (the "DIDA") which deregulates the rate of
interest, discount points and finance charges with respect to first lien
residential loans, including manufactured home loans and real estate secured
mortgage loans. As permitted under the DIDA, a number of states enacted
legislation timely opting out of coverage of either or both of the interest rate
and/or finance charge provisions of the DIDA. States may no longer opt out of
the interest rate provisions of the DIDA, but could in the future opt out of the
finance charge provisions. To be eligible for federal preemption for
manufactured home loans, our licensed finance companies must comply with certain
restrictions providing protection to consumers.

          Our finance operations are subject to regulation under other
applicable federal laws and regulations, the more significant of which include:
the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Home Owner Equity Protection Act, and certain rules and
regulations of the Federal Trade Commission.

          Our commercial lending operations are not subject to material
regulation in most states, although certain states do require licensing. In
addition, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act apply to
commercial loans to small businesses.

          We have internal controls designed to manage the risks associated with
our finance activities. However, there is a risk that one or more employees may
circumvent these controls, as has occurred at other financial institutions.

Competition
-----------

          Each of the markets in which we operate is highly competitive, and our
highly leveraged position has had a material adverse impact on our ability to
compete in these markets. The financial services industry consists of a large
number of companies, some of which are larger and have greater capital,
technological and marketing resources, access to capital and other sources of
liquidity at a lower cost, broader and more diversified product lines and larger
staffs than Conseco. An expanding number of banks, securities brokerage firms
and other financial intermediaries also market insurance products or offer
competing products, such as mutual fund products, traditional bank investments
and other investment and

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

retirement funding alternatives. We also compete with many of these companies
and others in providing services for fees. In most areas, competition is based
on a number of factors, including pricing, service provided to distributors and
policyholders and ratings. Conseco's subsidiaries must also compete with their
competitors to attract and retain the allegiance of dealers, vendors,
contractors, manufacturers, retailers and agents.

          An important competitive factor for life insurance companies is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. Agents,
insurance brokers and marketing companies who market our products and
prospective purchasers of our products use the ratings of our insurance
subsidiaries as one factor in determining which insurer's products to market or
purchase. Ratings have the most impact on our annuity and interest-sensitive
life insurance products. Insurance financial strength ratings are opinions
regarding an insurance company's financial capacity to meet the obligations of
its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. They are not directed
toward the protection of investors, and such ratings are not recommendations to
buy, sell or hold securities.

          In July 2002, A.M. Best Company, a nationally recognized insurance
company ratings organization, lowered the financial strength ratings of our
primary insurance subsidiaries from "A- (excellent)" to "B++ (very good)" and
placed the ratings "under review with negative implications." In August 2002,
A.M. Best further downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B (fair)". These ratings downgrades caused sales of
our insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase, which had a material adverse impact on our financial results. In some
cases, the ratings downgrades also caused defections among our sales force of
agents and/or increases in the commissions we had to pay to retain them. The
effect of these ratings downgrades is further discussed in "Events Leading to
the Chapter 11 Cases and Related Post-Petition Events - Insurance Ratings and
Regulatory Issues."

          Conseco's leveraged condition and liquidity difficulties also have
severely impacted the operations of our finance business. For a more complete
discussion of the effect of our leveraged condition and liquidity difficulties
on our finance business, see "Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases and Related
Post-Petition Events - Status of CFC; Strategic Alternatives Considered."

Employees
---------

          At December 31, 2002, CNC and its subsidiaries had approximately
10,100 employees, including: (i) 4,300 employees supporting our insurance
operations; (ii) 5,400 employees supporting our finance operations; and (iii)
400 employees supporting our holding company and shared services. None of our
employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

          For additional information about the Company's business operations,
refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2001 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2002. Additional information regarding the Company will be
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002,
scheduled to be filed on or about March 31, 2003, but not later than April 15,
2003. These filings are, or will be, available by visiting the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov or the Company's website at
www.conseco.com.

B.        EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF CNC AND CIHC

          1.   CNC

               (a)  Bank Debt

          CNC has a $1.5 billion credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility")
with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and various other lending
institutions. The Senior Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on December 31,
2003 and is currently fully drawn. Approximately $38 million of accrued and
unpaid interest was added to the outstanding principal amount of the Senior
Credit Facility pursuant to a

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

waiver dated September 8, 2002. In addition, as of the Petition Date, there was
an aggregate of approximately $6.1 million of unpaid interest on the Senior
Credit Facility.

               (b)  Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities

          Beginning in 1996, certain officers and directors of Conseco borrowed
money to purchase common stock of CNC under credit facilities provided by Bank
of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank and various other lending institutions
(individually, a "D&O Credit Facility", and collectively, the "D&O Credit
Facilities"). Until the fall of 2000, there were three D&O Credit Facilities:
the $245 million D&O Credit Facility entered into in 1997 (which included the
original purchasers in 1996 plus new purchasers in 1997); the $181 million D&O
Credit Facility entered into in 1998; and the $144 million D&O Credit Facility
entered into in 1999, which is partially secured. The aggregate amount of the
D&O Credit Facilities guaranteed as of the Petition Date was approximately
$481.3 million. In addition, as of the Petition Date, CNC owed approximately
$4.0 million of waiver consideration and approximately $9.6 million in interest
with respect to the D&O Credit Facilities.

          In May 2000, the 1999 D&O Credit Facility was refinanced to add
additional collateral in the form of pledges of stock of CIHC, CFC and CCM and
certain intercompany notes. In the fall of 2000, most of the borrowers
refinanced the existing facilities to extend the maturity date of the
obligations to December 31, 2003 (the scheduled maturity date of the Senior
Credit Facility). Certain of the officers and directors who are borrowers under
the 1998 D&O Credit Facility chose not to refinance (by not signing the
agreement), thereby creating, in effect, an additional tranche: the 1998
non-refinanced facility.

          Individual obligors under the D&O Credit Facilities owe amounts to:
(i) the lenders party to the D&O Credit Facilities for the principal amounts
borrowed (less any principal repayments); (ii) CNC for the payment of
approximately $55.5 million made in September 2002 from cash collateral
previously pledged by CNC to such lenders (such amounts correspondingly reduced
certain individual obligors' amounts owed to lenders under (i) above); and (iii)
Conseco Services, LLC, an affiliate of CNC ("Conseco Services"), for interest
and other fee payments made to the lenders party to the D&O Credit Facilities on
behalf of the individual obligors.

          On or about March 5, 2003, the TOPrS Committee filed an objection to
the proofs of claim filed by Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase Bank (which are
the Lender Claims), thereby commencing Adversary Proceeding No. 03 A 00659. In
this adversary proceeding, the TOPrS Committee requests that the Bankruptcy
Court (a) disallow the Lender Claims to the extent they assert claims under the
D&O Credit Facilities, (b) setoff against the Lender Claims all amounts
previously received by the Lenders under the D&O Credit Facilities, (c) grant
declaratory relief that (i) the Debtors' guarantees of the D&O Credit Facilities
are void and unenforceable under Regulation U and (ii) all payments made by the
Debtors on account of the Lender Claims are voidable and recoverable for the
benefit of the Debtors' bankruptcy estates, and (d) in the alternative,
equitably subordinate the Lender Claims to the extent of all amounts purportedly
owed, and all amounts previously received, under the D&O Credit Facilities. When
the D&O Credit Facilities were established, the Debtors' counsel at the time
issued opinions that the D&O Credit Facilities complied with Regulation U.

          As of the date of this Disclosure Statement, no party has responded to
the TOPrS Committee's objection to the Lender Claims. The Debtors believe that
the TOPrS Committee does not have standing to object to the Lender Claims. The
TOPrS Committee maintains that it does have a right to object to the Lender
Claims. The TOPrS Committee objection is set for a pretrial conference on April
9, 2003 at 10:30 a.m.

          Even if the TOPrS Committee is successful in its effort to void the
D&O Credit Facilities,(5) the value of New CNC would be distributed consistent
with prepetition contractual subordination provisions, which generally require
that the Lender Claims are paid in full before the Exchange Note Claims receive
any distribution, and that the Lender Claims, the 93/94 Note Claims, the
Exchange Note Claims and the

---------------------
5    The TOPrS Committee also seeks to equitably subordinate the entire amount
     of the Lender Claims.


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

Original Note Claims are paid in full before the Holders of Trust Related Claims
receive any distribution. Listed below are the outstanding prepetition amounts
for the claims that are senior to the Trust Related Claims (assuming the D&O
Credit Facilities are voided):

          o    $1.537 billion on account of the Senior Credit Facility;
          o    $93.7 million on account of the 93/94 Notes;
          o    $1.371 billion on account of the Exchange Notes; and
          o    $1.242 billion on account of the Original Notes,

          The sum of these amounts is approximately $4.244 billion. As described
on page 3 of this Disclosure Statement, the Absolute Priority Alternative (which
would apply if the Plan were not confirmed) would strictly give effect to
prepetition subordination agreements. The relevant prepetition documents that
govern the Trust Related Claims require the Holders of such Claims to contribute
their recoveries to the senior creditors until the senior creditors are paid in
full.(6) Thus, even if the TOPrS Committee is successful in its efforts to void
the D&O Credit Facilities, there will be no distribution to the Holders of Trust
Related Claims if the value of New CNC is less than approximately $4.244
billion.(7)

          The TOPrS Committee has also observed that if the D&O Credit
Facilities are voided, it is possible that the Lender Claims might be further
reduced by payments made in respect of the D&O Credit Facilities by the Debtors
and not the individual borrowers. If this relief is granted, as requested by the
TOPrS Committee, the Lender Claims could be further reduced by approximately
$198 million, and a valuation of New CNC of approximately $4.05 billion would
entitle the TOPrS to a recovery from the estate.(8)

          The foregoing matters will be addressed in detail at the Confirmation
Hearing.

          It should be noted that if the TOPrS Committee is successful in its
efforts to void the D&O Credit Facilities, the agreement between the Noteholder
Subcommittee and the Lender Subcommittee that is the basis of the Plan may be
irreparably upset, thereby delaying the restructuring process, and potentially
reducing the value of New CNC.

               (c)  The 93/94 Notes

          In 1993, CNC issued $200,000,000 of 8.125% senior notes due February
15, 2003 (the "93 Notes"). In 1994, CCP Insurance, Inc. ("CCP") issued
$200,000,000 of 10.5% senior notes due December 15, 2004 (the "94 Notes"). CNC
acquired CCP by merger on August 31, 1995 and assumed CCP's obligations under
the 94 Notes in connection with the merger.

          We sometimes refer to the 93 Notes and the 94 Notes collectively as
the "93/94 Notes." The 93/94 Notes are secured by the stock of CIHC, CCM, CFC
and certain of its subsidiaries and certain intercompany notes. It is
anticipated that substantially all of CFC's assets will be sold in connection
with the Company's reorganization. If certain of these assets have been pledged
to the holders of the 93/94 Notes, and if proceeds of these pledged assets are
used to pay the 93/94 Notes, then CFC may assert, by subrogation, the rights of
such holders against the Reorganizing Debtors. As of the Petition Date, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 93/94 Notes was approximately $88
million and there was an aggregate of approximately $5.7 million of unpaid
interest on the 93/94 Notes.

----------------------
6    Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Creditors would not
     contribute their recoveries to the senior creditors because they do not
     have a subordination provision with the senior creditors.


7    This amount does not include post-petition interest, which the senior
     creditors are entitled to receive under the Plan.


8    The Holders of Trust Related Claims will recover in such a scenario only if
     some other source exists to pay Allowed Administrative Claims, Priority
     Claims and Secured Claims in full before unsecured Claims, such as the
     Trust Related Claims, receive any distribution.



                                      -20-
<PAGE>

          The collateral that secures the 93/94 Notes was pledged pursuant to an
"equal and ratable" clause in the indentures governing the 93/94 Notes. The
indentures of the 93/94 Notes provide that if another creditor obtains a
security interest in certain property of CNC or any of its significant
subsidiaries, then the 93/94 Notes will automatically obtain an "equal and
ratable" security interest in such property. Certain parties, including the CFC
Committee, have alleged that the legal mechanism by which the 93/94 Notes
obtained a security interest somehow impairs that security interest. Such
parties allege that because the holders of the 93/94 Notes did not provide
consideration for the security interest that they received simply because
another party received that security interest, the 93/94 Notes' security
interest may be voided under a theory of unjust enrichment, fraudulent
conveyance or lack of consideration. Wilmington Trust Company, the indenture
trustee under the 93/94 Notes, maintains that any and all claims with respect to
the avoidability of the 93/94 Notes, including the claims of the CFC Committee,
are frivolous and wholly without merit.

               (d)  The Original Notes

          Between 1998 and 2001, CNC issued the following series of senior
notes: (i) $450,000,000 of 8.5% senior notes due October 15, 2002 (the "8.5%
Original Notes"); (ii) $250,000,000 of 6.4% senior notes due February 10, 2003
(the "6.4% Original Notes"); (iii) $800,000,000 of 8.75% senior notes due
February 9, 2004 (the "8.75% Original Notes"); (iv) $250,000,000 of 6.8% senior
notes due June 15, 2005 (the "6.8% Original Notes"); (v) $550,000,000 of 9.0%
senior notes due October 15, 2006 (the "9.0% Original Notes"); and (vi)
$400,000,000 of 10.75% senior notes due June 15, 2008 (the "10.75% Original
Notes").

          We sometimes refer to the foregoing series of senior notes
collectively as the "Original Notes." As of the Petition Date, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Original Notes was approximately $1.17
billion, and there was an aggregate of approximately $72.2 million of unpaid
interest on the Original Notes.

               (e)  The Exchange Notes

          In connection with an exchange offer completed in April 2002, CNC
issued: (i) $991,000 of 8.5% senior notes due October 15, 2003, in exchange for
an equal amount of 8.5% Original Notes due October 15, 2002 (the "8.5% Exchange
Notes"); (ii) $14,936,000 of 6.4% senior notes due February 10, 2004 in exchange
for an equal amount of 6.4% Original Notes due February 10, 2003 (the "6.4%
Exchange Notes"); (iii) $364,294,000 of 8.75% senior notes due August 9, 2006 in
exchange for an equal amount of 8.75% Original Notes due February 9, 2004 (the
"8.75% Exchange Notes"); (iv) $150,783,000 of 6.8% senior notes due June 15,
2007 in exchange for an equal amount of 6.8% Original Notes due June 15, 2005
(the "6.8% Exchange Notes"); (v) $399,200,000 of 9.0% senior notes due April 15,
2008 in exchange for an equal amount of 9.0% Original Notes due October 15, 2006
(the "9.0% Exchange Notes"); and (vi) $362,433,000 of 10.75% senior notes due
June 15, 2009 in exchange for an equal amount of 10.75% Original Notes due June
15, 2008 (the "10.75% Exchange Notes").

          We sometimes refer to the foregoing series of senior notes
collectively as the "Exchange Notes." The Exchange Notes are guaranteed by CIHC
and are otherwise identical to the corresponding series of Original Notes in all
material respects but for the fact that they bear a CIHC guarantee and their
respective maturity dates. As of the Petition Date, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Exchange Notes was approximately $1.29 billion, and
there was an aggregate of approximately $78.3 million of unpaid interest on the
Exchange Notes.

               (f)  Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures

          The following securities have been issued by subsidiary trusts of CNC:
9.16% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "9.16% TOPrS"); 8.70% Trust
Pass-Through Securities (the "8.70% TRuPS"); 8.796% Capital Securities (the
"8.796% Capital Securities"); 6.75% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the
"6.75% TOPrS"); 8.70% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "8.70% TOPrS");
9% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "9% TOPrS"); and 9.44% Trust
Originated Preferred Securities (the "9.44% TOPrS"). We sometimes refer to the
9.16% TOPrS, 8.70% TRuPS, 8.796% Capital Securities,

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

6.75% TOPrS, 8.70% TOPrS, 9.00% TOPrS and 9.44% TOPrS collectively as the "Trust
Preferred Securities."

          Each trust used the proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Preferred
Securities to purchase subordinated debentures from CNC (the "Subordinated
Debentures"). The interest rate and other terms of each series of Trust
Preferred Securities mirror the terms of the applicable underlying Subordinated
Debentures issued by CNC. The holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are
entitled to preferred dividend payments from the trust, payable from the
interest payments received from CNC on the underlying Subordinated Debentures.
CNC provides a guarantee to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities of the
amounts due on such Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent that the
trust has received interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures. As of the
Petition Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated
Debentures was approximately $1.93 billion, and there was an aggregate of
approximately $89.1 million of unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures.

               (g)  Preferred Stock and Common Stock

          CNC has two outstanding series of preferred stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Common-Linked Convertible Preferred Stock, and has committed
to authorize a third series of preferred stock, Series G Preferred Stock. As of
December 31, 2002, there were: (i) 90,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock,
$10,000 stated value per share, issued and outstanding (the "Series E Preferred
Stock"), all of which is held by Bankers National Life Insurance Company, an
indirect subsidiary of CNC; (ii) 2,855,502 shares of Series F Common-Linked
Convertible Preferred Stock, $192.50 stated value per share, issued and
outstanding (the "Series F Preferred Stock"), substantially all of which is held
by Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund IV, L.P. and its affiliated investors; and (iii) no
shares of Series G Preferred Stock issued and outstanding (the "Series G
Preferred Stock").

          As of December 31, 2002, CNC had 346.0 million shares of common stock,
no par value, issued and outstanding. The common stock (and all other listed
securities of CNC) was delisted from the NYSE effective September 25, 2002. See
"Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases and Related Post-Petition Events -
Delisting of Common Stock and Other Listed Securities."

          2.   CIHC

               (a)  Guarantees of CNC and CFC Debt

          Although CIHC has no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money
(other than for intercompany notes, which are identified on Exhibit F and
Exhibit G attached hereto), it is the guarantor of CNC's Senior Credit Facility.
The Senior Credit Facility is currently fully drawn, and approximately $38
million of accrued and unpaid interest has been added to the outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a waiver dated
September 8, 2002. As of the Petition Date, there was an aggregate of
approximately $6.1 million of unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facility.
CIHC is the guarantor of an aggregate principal amount of $125 million in
respect of CFC's residual and warehouse facilities with Lehman Brothers, Inc.
and certain of its affiliates ("Lehman"). CIHC is the guarantor of an aggregate
principal amount of $125 million in respect of CFC's swingline debt and cash
management facility with U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank"). U.S. Bank
has objected to the Plan's treatment of its Claim under this guaranty on the
grounds that it is treated less favorably than the 93/94 Note Claims. The
Debtors reserve the right to amend the Plan to address this objection. CIHC is
also a guarantor on an aggregate principal amount of approximately $481.3
million in respect of the D&O Credit Facilities. Finally, CIHC is the guarantor
of an aggregate principal amount of $1.29 billion of Exchange Notes issued by
CNC.

          CIHC's existing prepetition guarantee in respect of CFC's swingline
debt and cash management facility with U.S. Bank was "rolled into" the Secured
Super-Priority Debtor In Possession Credit Agreement dated December 19, 2002
(the "FPS DIP") between CFC, certain of its subsidiaries, CIHC, certain lenders
parties thereto from time to time and FPS DIP LLC. Accordingly, CIHC has an
outstanding prepetition guarantee for an amount of $60 million pursuant to the
FPS DIP.

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

          As explained in further detail in Section II.C.6, "Status of CFC;
Strategic Alternatives Considered," the swingline debt and cash management
facility was paid-off with proceeds from the FPS DIP on December 19, 2002.

          The CFC Committee has alleged that the Finance Company Debtors may
have avoidance actions against Lehman or other theories to invalidate Lehman's
liens and/or claims against the Finance Company Debtors. The CFC Committee has
until April 16, 2003 to assert any claims or actions against Lehman.

               (b)  Preferred Stock and Common Stock

          CIHC has authorized three series of preferred stock: (i) 1994 Series
Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value per share (the "1994 Series Preferred
Stock"); (ii) $2.32 Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock, $0.01 stated value
per share (the "$2.32 Preferred Stock"); and (iii) 1998 Series Redeemable
Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value per share (the "1998 Series Preferred
Stock"). As of December 31, 2002, there were 151,531.319 shares of 1994 Series
Preferred Stock, 1,200,000 shares of $2.32 Preferred Stock and 90,000 shares of
1998 Series Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.

          As of December 31, 2002, CIHC had 1,001.041 shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding, 1,000 shares of which were
held by CNC and 1.041 shares of which were held by Conseco Annuity Assurance
Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CIHC.

C.        EVENTS LEADING TO THE CHAPTER 11 CASES AND RELATED POST-PETITION
          EVENTS

          1.   Background to the Restructuring

          Conseco commenced operations in 1982 and grew rapidly through
acquisitions, including the acquisition of 19 separate insurance groups and
related businesses and the acquisition of Green Tree Financial Corporation in
1998. The acquisition of Green Tree (renamed "Conseco Finance Corp.") served as
the platform for Conseco's entry into the consumer finance business.

          In order to fund these acquisitions and grow its businesses, CNC, our
parent holding company, incurred substantial indebtedness through borrowings
under bank credit facilities and the issuance of securities in public capital
markets. CIHC, our intermediate holding company, also incurred significant
indebtedness in the form of guarantees. See "Existing Capital Structure of CNC
and CIHC." Between 1998 and 2000, CNC incurred $3.6 billion in new debt and
trust preferred obligations, primarily to fund the business of CFC following its
acquisition. In addition to increased indebtedness levels, we also began to
recognize impairment charges because the actual performance of CFC's securitized
loan portfolios did not meet the assumptions that were used in establishing the
value of the interests we have retained (generally interest-only securities and
servicing rights) in securitization transactions accounted for as sales.
Impairment charges represent reductions in the value of our retained interests
recognized as a loss in the statement of operations. The value of the retained
interests are determined by discounting the projected future cash flows we
expect to receive over the life of the securitizations using our current best
estimates of prepayment, default, loss and interest rate assumptions. The
assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value are subject to
significant judgment and are determined based on internal evaluations and
consultations with outside advisors.

          During the past two years, we undertook efforts to reduce our parent
company debt. These efforts primarily focused on the sale of non-strategic
assets to meet principal and interest payment obligations. We also took a number
of other actions designed to reduce parent company debt and increase the
efficiency of our business operations. The actions with respect to our finance
business included: (i) the sale, closing or runoff of several business units
(including asset-based lending, vendor leasing, bankcards, transportation, park
construction and floorplan lending); (ii) monetization of certain on-balance
sheet financial assets through sales or as collateral for additional borrowings;
(iii) cost savings and restructuring of ongoing businesses such as streamlining
of credit origination operations in the manufactured housing and home equity
divisions; and (iv) substantial decreases in the origination of certain lines of
products in certain business segments, particularly in the manufactured housing
segment. The actions with respect to our

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

insurance business included: (i) the sale of our variable annuity business; (ii)
reinsurance transactions of various insurance blocks; and (iii) the division of
our insurance segment into two, more efficient, operating groups.

          In addition to these measures, in April 2002, we extended the
maturities of approximately $1.29 billion in principal amount of our senior
notes by one year to two and one-half years through an exchange offer in an
effort to improve our financial flexibility and enhance our ability to refinance
our public debt.

          Notwithstanding these initiatives, the Company's financial position
continued to deteriorate. For the six months ended June 30, 2002, CNC suffered a
net loss applicable to common stock of $4,380.1 million, including the
cumulative effect of an accounting charge for a goodwill impairment of $2,949.2
million and the establishment of a valuation allowance of $1,003.0 million for
the entire balance of net deferred income tax assets at June 30, 2002, as we
believe the realization of such assets in future periods is uncertain. This loss
reduced CNC's shareholders' equity to $533.0 million. The reduction in
shareholders' equity negatively impacted the financial strength ratings of our
insurance subsidiaries and the capital market ratings of our outstanding parent
company securities, and effectively precluded us from raising significant
amounts of additional capital in the public markets. The net loss for the second
quarter, including the establishment of a deferred tax valuation reserve,
resulted in a breach of the debt to capitalization ratio covenant in the Senior
Credit Facility, although we did obtain temporary waivers from the relevant
lenders. These developments also made it significantly more difficult to obtain
regulatory approvals of dividend payments from our insurance subsidiaries.

          2.   Announcement of Restructuring Plan; Events of Default

          As a result of these developments, on August 9, 2002, we announced
that we had engaged legal and financial advisors to begin discussions with
creditors in order to effectuate a fundamental restructuring of the Company's
capital structure. We also announced that we did not make the August 2002
interest payments on the 6.4% Original Notes, 6.4% Exchange Notes, 8.75%
Original Notes and 8.75% Exchange Notes. Since the August 9, 2002 announcement,
we have not made any interest or principal payments on any of our direct
corporate obligations, nor have we made any distributions on our Trust Preferred
Securities. The failure to make the interest payments on these notes within the
30-day grace period constituted an event of default under the notes, which gave
the holders of the notes the right to accelerate the maturity of all principal
and past due interest. We did not pay the $224.9 million of principal (plus
accrued interest) that was due on October 15, 2002 under the 8.5% Original
Notes. Our default with respect to the payment of principal on these notes also
resulted in defaults under approximately $4.0 billion principal amount of debt
obligations, approximately $481.3 million of obligations under the D&O Credit
Facilities and approximately $1.93 billion of Subordinated Indentures (and the
corresponding Trust Preferred Securities) through cross-default provisions
contained in the respective governing instruments. If the holders of such
indebtedness or preferred securities had exercised their rights to accelerate
the maturity of all principal and interest due, we would not have been able to
satisfy these obligations.

          On September 9, 2002, Conseco received temporary waivers of the
covenant violations with respect to the Senior Credit Facility and the D&O
Credit Facilities from the relevant lenders. These waivers expired on October
17, 2002. On that date, Conseco obtained forbearance agreements from the
relevant lenders pursuant to which the lenders agreed to temporarily refrain
from exercising default-related remedies with respect to certain specified
events of default under the Senior Credit Facility and the guarantees of the D&O
Credit Facilities. These forbearance agreements were scheduled to expire on
November 27, 2002, but were extended on that date to January 11, 2003, subject
to various conditions. Upon filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the forbearance
agreements terminated and were superseded by the automatic stay provisions under
section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          3.   Delisting of Common Stock and Other Listed Securities

          After the issuance of our press release on August 9, 2002, the NYSE
halted trading in CNC's common stock and other listed securities. On August 12,
2002, the NYSE issued a public announcement of the suspension of trading. The
Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently granted the NYSE's

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

application for removal from listing and registration with respect to the
following CNC securities: (i) common stock, (ii) 93 Notes, (iii) 94 Notes, (iv)
9.16% TOPrS, (v) 8.70% TOPrS, (vi) 9% TOPrS and (vii) 9.44% TOPrS, effective on
the opening of the trading session on September 25, 2002.

          4.   Ratings Downgrades of CNC Securities

          As a result of the events leading up to our August 9, 2002
announcement and subsequent events, we have experienced a number of ratings
downgrades with respect to our outstanding securities. On September 9, 2002, our
senior debt ratings were lowered from "C" to "D" by Fitch IBCA. Fitch employs a
system of 12 national ratings, ranging from "AAA" to "D" with pluses and minuses
used to indicate the relative position of a credit within a ratings category.

          On October 4, 2002, Standard & Poor's lowered our senior debt rating
from "CC" to "D". Standard & Poor's maintains 10 ratings categories, ranging
from "AAA (Extremely strong)" to "D (Defaulted)" with pluses and minuses used to
indicate relative positions within each category.

          On October 25, 2002, the credit rating for our senior notes was
downgraded to "Ca" by Moody's, which said its ratings outlook for us is
developing. Moody's employs a system of nine national ratings, ranging from
"Aaa" to "C" with modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to indicate the relative strength or
weakness within each rating. "Ca" is the eighth best rating out of nine. In its
October 25, 2002 release, Moody's stated that "the Ca senior unsecured rating
reflects the heightened uncertainty surrounding Conseco's liquidity and
financial flexibility, and the residual value of the company, a key determinant
of the recovery value for debtholders."

          Immediately prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, our Trust
Preferred Securities were rated "D" by Standard & Poor's, "D" by Fitch and "C"
by Moody's. The ratings of our securities made it impossible for Conseco to
issue additional securities in the public markets.

          5.   Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues

          An important competitive factor for our insurance subsidiaries is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. See
"Description of Conseco's Business - The Company's Business - Competition." In
July 2002, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B++ (Very Good)" and placed the ratings "under review
with negative implications." On August 14, 2002, A.M. Best further lowered the
financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries from "B++ (very
good)" to "B (fair)." A.M. Best ratings for the industry currently range from
"A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)" and some companies are not rated. An
"A++" ranking indicates superior overall performance and a strong ability to
meet obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The "B" rating is
assigned to companies which have, on balance, fair balance sheet strength,
operating performance and business profile, when compared to the standards
established by A.M. Best, and have an ability in A.M. Best's opinion to meet
their current obligations to policyholders, but their financial strength is
vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions. The
rating reflects A.M. Best's view of the uncertainty surrounding our
restructuring initiatives and the potential adverse financial impact on the
subsidiaries if negotiations are protracted and execution of the restructuring
plan is delayed. Standard & Poor's has given our insurance subsidiaries a
financial strength rating of "B+". Rating categories from "BB" to "CCC" are
classified as "vulnerable," and pluses and minuses show the relative standing
within a category. In Standard & Poor's view, an insurer rated "B" has the
capacity to meet its financial commitments but adverse business conditions could
lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments.

          These ratings downgrades caused sales of our insurance products to
decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to increase. In some cases, the
downgrades also caused defections among our independent agent sales force and
increases in the commissions we had to pay to retain them. These events have had
a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further downgrades by A.M.
Best or Standard & Poor's would likely have further material and adverse effects
on our financial results and liquidity.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>


          Since the announcement of our restructuring efforts on August 9, 2002,
we have been working closely with insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, New
York, Pennsylvania and Texas) in connection with their monitoring of the
operations and financial status of our insurance subsidiaries. The Commissioner
of Insurance for the State of Texas has acted as the lead regulator among these
states and has principally coordinated the oversight and monitoring efforts
associated with our financial restructuring.

          On October 30, 2002, Bankers National Life Insurance Company and
Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), our two insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas, each entered
into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas
whereby they agreed: (i) not to request any dividends or other distributions
before January 1, 2003 and, thereafter, not to pay any dividends or other
distributions to parent companies outside of the insurance system without the
prior approval of the Texas Insurance Commissioner; (ii) to continue to maintain
sufficient capitalization and reserves as required by the Texas Insurance Code;
(iii) to request approval from the Texas Insurance Commissioner before making
any disbursements not in the ordinary course of business; (iv) to complete any
pending transactions previously reported to the proper insurance regulatory
officials prior to and during Conseco's restructuring, unless not approved by
the Texas Insurance Commissioner; (v) to obtain a commitment from CNC and CIHC
to maintain their infrastructure, employees, systems and physical facilities
prior to and during Conseco's restructuring; and (vi) to continue to permit the
Texas Insurance Commissioner to examine its books, papers, accounts, records and
affairs. The consent orders do not prohibit the payment of fees in the ordinary
course of business pursuant to existing administrative, investment management
and marketing agreements with our non-insurance subsidiaries.

          6.   Status of CFC; Strategic Alternatives Considered

          During the course of the recent economic slowdown, loans originated by
our finance subsidiaries have suffered a sustained period of increased
delinquencies, foreclosures and losses and our finance subsidiaries have
incurred increased costs in servicing these loans, all of which have had a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
These conditions, coupled with our leveraged condition and liquidity
difficulties, have severely impacted the operations of CFC, and eliminated CFC's
access to the securitization markets. The securitization markets historically
have been CFC's main source of funding. The loss of access to the securitization
markets has severely affected CFC's ability to originate, purchase and sell
loans. It has also affected the value of the retained interests CFC holds in
securitization manufactured housing trusts, since CFC relied on the
securitization markets to finance the sale of repossessed manufactured housing
units owned by those trusts, which often helped to minimize the loss on
defaulted loans (compared to liquidating those assets through a manufactured
housing wholesale channel).

          On October 22, 2002, CNC announced that its board of directors
approved a plan to sell or seek new investors for the finance businesses and
that the investment banking firms of Lazard Freres & Co., LLC and Credit Suisse
First Boston had been engaged to pursue various alternatives, including securing
new investors and/or selling CFC's three lines of business: (i) manufactured
housing; (ii) mortgage and home equity services; and (iii) consumer finance
(including a potential sale, joint venture or similar transaction with respect
to CFC's servicing platforms). For a discussion of the sale process, see
"Planned Sale of CFC."

          As of the Petition Date, CFC's remaining liquidity sources were a
warehouse facility (the "Warehouse Facility") and a residual facility ("Residual
Facility") with Lehman and a bank credit facility with U.S. Bank (the "U.S. Bank
Facility," and together with the Warehouse Facility and Residual Facility, the
"CFC Facilities"). The direct borrower under (i) the Warehouse Facility is CFC's
non-debtor subsidiary Green Tree Finance Corp. - Five ("GTFC"), and (ii) the
Residual Facility is CFC's non-debtor subsidiary Green Tree Residual Finance
Corp. I ("GTRFC"). The Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility are fully
guaranteed by CFC and, up to an aggregate of $125 million, by CIHC . CFC was the
direct borrower under the U.S. Bank Facility, which was also guaranteed by CIHC
up to an aggregate of $125 million.

          Prior to the Petition Date, CFC was in default under the CFC
Facilities as a result of (i) cross-defaults triggered by CNC's defaulting on
its debt obligations, (ii) cross-defaults among the U.S. Bank Facility, the
Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility, (iii) failure to make payments
required by

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

CFC's guarantees of payments on certain lower-rated securities referred to as
"B-2 securities," which were issued to investors in certain finance receivable
securitization transactions (see the note to CNC's consolidated financial
statements entitled "Guarantees" as set forth in CNC's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and CNC's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2002 for further information); and
(iv) breaches of several financial covenants under the CFC Facilities. CFC
entered into forbearance agreements with Lehman with respect to the Warehouse
Facility and Residual Facility and with U.S. Bank with respect to U.S. Bank
Facility, pursuant to which Lehman and U.S. Bank agreed to temporarily refrain
from exercising any rights arising from events of default that occurred under
each CFC Facility prior to the Petition Date.

          The Warehouse Facility is a repurchase facility under which primarily
newly originated manufactured housing, home equity, home improvement and
recreational vehicle loans originated by CFC or affiliates of CFC and
transferred to GTFC are sold by GTFC to Lehman with an agreement to repurchase
those loans at a later date and at a higher price. The price differential
reflects the cost of financing. The Warehouse Facility provides funding to CFC
for new loan origination. The Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility are
cross-collateralized.

          The Residual Facility is collateralized by retained interests in
securitizations. CFC is required to maintain collateral based on current
estimated fair values in accordance with the terms of such facility. Due to the
decrease in the estimated fair value of its retained interests, CFC's collateral
was $128.9 million deficient at September 30, 2002 (as calculated in accordance
with the relevant transaction documents, which provide that Lehman calculates
the value of CFC's collateral within its sole discretion). Pursuant to the
forbearance agreement entered into with Lehman on December 20, 2002, Lehman
agreed not to accelerate the repayment of the Residual Facility based on the
collateral deficiency through June 1, 2003. Under the terms of this forbearance
agreement, Lehman retains the cash flows from CFC's retained interests pledged
under this facility and applies those cash flows to the margin deficit. As
mentioned above, this forbearance agreement is subject to a number of conditions
that may cause it to terminate prior to June 1, 2003.

          The filing by CNC, CIHC and CFC of a Chapter 11 petition triggered
additional defaults under the CFC Facilities.

          On December 19, 2002, shortly after the filing of the Chapter 11
Cases, the U.S. Bank Facility was paid-off with the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court with a portion of the proceeds of the debtor-in-possession ("DIP")
financing provided by U.S. Bank and FPS DIP LLC, an affiliate of Fortress
Investment Group LLC ("Fortress"), J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC. ("Flowers") and
Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. ("Cerberus"). The DIP financing is for up to
$125,000,000. The DIP financing motion was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on
January 14, 2003. Proceeds of the FPS DIP were applied to the repayment in full
of the U.S. Bank Facility.

          From time to time, CFC has failed to comply with certain covenants
regarding the maximum permissible variance of the budgets provided to the FPS
DIP lenders in connection with the FPS DIP. In each instance, CFC has obtained
appropriate waivers. The occurrence of events of default under the FPS DIP, may
cause events of default under the Lehman December 20 Agreements (as defined
below).

          On December 20, 2002, CFC, GTFC, and GTRFC, entered into several
agreements with Lehman: (the "Lehman December 20 Agreements") (i) providing that
Lehman temporarily refrain from exercising any rights arising from events of
default that occurred under each relevant CFC Facility (including, but not
limited to, those arising out of CNC, CIHC and CFC filing for chapter 11 relief)
until June 1, 2003; (ii) indirectly providing CFC with up to $25,000,000 in
postpetition financing by allowing GTFC to provide intercompany loans to CFC
with cash flows obtained from the Warehouse Facility; (iii) decreasing the
capacity of the Warehouse Facility to a maximum of $250,000,000; and (iv)
otherwise amending the Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility. These
agreements are subject to a number of conditions that may cause them to
terminate prior to June 1, 2003.

          As a result of CFC's defaults and the agreements entered into with
Lehman on December 20, 2002, CFC may not draw funds from the Residual Facility.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>


          On March 4, 2003, CFC and certain of its affiliates filed a motion
with the Bankruptcy Court to obtain approval of the Secured Super-Priority
Debtor In Possession Credit Agreement with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P.
("Goldman Sachs") as administrative and loan agent and certain lenders party
thereto from time to time (the "GS DIP"), a form of which was filed as an
exhibit to the motion. The GS DIP provides for debtor in possession financing up
to $845 million. CFC filed this motion in an abundance of caution to provide an
alternative to the Finance Company Debtors if the CFC auction did not yield
appropriate value.

          Assuming that CFC decides to draw on the GS DIP, the proceeds thereof
will be applied (i) to repay any amounts outstanding under the FPS DIP; (ii) as
a $1,000,000 line of credit for Conseco Finance Credit Corporation; (iii) to pay
any fees or expenses owed to the GS DIP Lenders; (iv) to provide general working
capital and to pay ordinary operating costs and expenses of the Finance Company
Debtors in accordance with the final cash budget up to $100,000,000; (v) to
repay outstanding secured indebtedness held by existing secured creditors of the
Finance Company Debtors on terms and conditions acceptable to Goldman Sachs;
(vi) to pay the break-up fee owed pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, if
and to the extent such amounts are due and payable; and (vii) up to an amount to
be agreed to by GS shall be used to pay priority claims as set forth in section
507 of the Bankruptcy Code upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization
of the Finance Company Debtors, to the extent payment of such claims is required
in order for the Bankruptcy Court to confirm a plan of reorganization of the
Finance Company Debtors.

          The GS DIP entitles Goldman Sachs to receive, under certain
circumstances and conditions, (i) a "Termination Fee" equal to (A) $40 million;
or (B) 30% of all assets or property distributed pursuant to a plan of
reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to CFC, including
any indebtedness, stock, stock equivalents or other equity interests of CFC
and/or any of its subsidiaries (subject to customary anti-dilution provisions),
at the election of Goldman Sachs (the "Termination Fee"); or (ii) a "Conversion
Fee" equal to 30% of any stock, stock equivalents or other equity interests
(subject to customary anti-dilution provisions) distributed with respect to CFC
and its subsidiaries in accordance with a plan of reorganization of the Finance
Company Debtors approved by the Bankruptcy Court (the "Conversion Fee"). The
Termination Fee and the Conversion Fee are mutually exclusive.

          7.   Recent Financial Results

          On November 19, 2002, CNC reported a net loss of $1,769.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2002. This loss was primarily the result
of: (i) impairment charges related to our interest-only securities and servicing
rights held by our finance subsidiary of $701.3 million; (ii) impairment charges
related to goodwill of $500.0 million; (iii) realized investment losses related
to our investment portfolio of $271.7 million; (iv) an increase to our reserves
with respect to long-term care insurance products for changes in estimates of
$110.0 million; and (v) a loss on the sale of Conseco Variable Insurance Company
of $139.9 million. As a result of this loss, CNC's shareholders' deficit was
$811.8 million at September 30, 2002.

          CNC will report its year end 2002 financial results in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, which it expects to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about March 31, 2003, but
no later than April 15, 2003. This filing will be available at the SEC's website
at www.sec.gov and at the Company's website at www.conseco.com.

          8.   The Prepetition Committees

          In the fall of 2002, we commenced discussions with a committee
representing the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility and the D&O Credit
Facilities with respect to the financial condition of the Company and the
proposed restructuring (the "Prepetition Bank Committee"). The members of the
Prepetition Bank Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Bank of America, N.A.,
JPMorgan Chase Bank and Angelo, Gordon & Co. Bank of America, as administrative
agent for the Senior Credit Facility and some of the D&O Credit Facilities,
retained Davis Polk & Wardwell as its legal advisor and Ernst & Young and
Greenhill & Co., LLC as its financial advisors.

                                      -28-
<PAGE>


          In August 2002, the Company commenced discussions with certain holders
of the 93/94 Notes, Original Notes and Exchange Notes with respect to the
financial condition of the Company and the proposed restructuring (the
"Prepetition Noteholder Committee"). The members of the Prepetition Noteholder
Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC,
First Pacific Advisors, Appaloosa Management Company, Barclays Bank, PLC,
Calvert Group, Ltd., HSBC Bank USA (as indenture trustee) and Whippoorwill
Associates, Inc. The Prepetition Noteholder Committee retained Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson as its legal advisor and Houlihan Lokey Howard &
Zukin LLP as its financial advisor.

          In October 2002, the Company commenced discussions with certain
holders of the Trust Preferred Securities with respect to the financial
condition of the Company and the proposed restructuring (the "Prepetition Trust
Preferred Securities Committee"). The members of the Prepetition Trust Preferred
Securities Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Oppenheimer Capital, United
Capital Markets, Marion Polk Real Estate and Smith Hayes Financial. The
Prepetition Trust Preferred Securities Committee retained Saul Ewing LLP as its
legal advisor and Raymond James as its financial advisor.

          Before the Petition Date, the Company met with and provided materials
to the Prepetition Trust Preferred Securities Committee, and the Company entered
into extensive arms' length negotiations with the Prepetition Bank Committee and
the Prepetition Noteholder Committee regarding the terms of a consensual
restructuring. Shortly before the Petition Date, the Company reached a
non-binding agreement in principle with respect to the general terms of a
restructuring with the Prepetition Bank Committee and Prepetition Noteholder
Committee.(9) The Reorganizing Debtors, and not the members of any of the
foregoing committees, are the proponents of the Plan.

D.        PLANNED SALE OF CFC

          On December 19, 2002, CFC and certain of its subsidiaries entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement with CFN, an affiliate of Fortress, Flowers and
Cerberus, pursuant to which CFC agreed to sell substantially all of the CFC
Assets in a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. In accordance
with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, on January 16, 2003, CFN gave
irrevocable notice to CFC that, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, it would acquire CFC's
manufactured housing business (including, without limitation, the manufactured
housing servicing platform) and on February 24, 2003, CFN gave irrevocable
notice to CFC that, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, it would acquire the stock of Mill Creek
Bank.

          In addition to seeking to sell its assets, CFC also sought to
restructure its manufactured housing business by reducing the negative cash
flows that currently result from this portfolio by: (i) increasing the amount
and payment priority of the servicing fee (the "MH Servicing Fee") it receives
as compensation for servicing the securitized manufactured housing portfolios
(which, as explained above, is a condition precedent for the transactions
contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement) as set forth in certain servicing
agreements (the "Servicing Agreements"), and (ii) restructuring the guarantees
on the B-2 securities issued in connection with securitizations of manufactured
housing receivables as set forth in certain sale agreements (the "Sale
Agreements"). CFC has not made any such guarantee payments due on or after
November 15, 2002.

          As part of CFC's efforts to seek alternative transactions that would
provide greater value to CFC, and in accordance with the bidding procedures
order approved by the Bankruptcy Court, CFC conducted an auction for the sale of
its businesses and assets. Potential bidders that submitted bids for the
purchase of the CFC Assets that, by their own terms or aggregated with other
bids, were for more than the purchase price payable under the Asset Purchase
Agreement, plus the amount of the break-up fee, plus $5 million, plus the profit
sharing rights relating to the manufactured housing business, were allowed to
participate in

------------------
9    The Official Committee continues to review the Plan and this Disclosure
     Statement to ensure that they accurately reflect the agreement in
     principle. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Official
     Committee has advised the Debtors that it does not support the release and
     indemnification provisions in the current form.


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


the auction. The auction, which commenced on February 28, 2003, promptly
adjourned, and was continued on March 4, 2003, ultimately concluding the morning
of March 5, 2003.

          CFC, with the assistance of its advisors, analyzed each of the bids
presented at the auction and determined that CFN's bid of $970 million in cash,
plus the assumption of certain liabilities, represented the highest and best
bid. The terms of the sale included an option to sell the assets of Mill Creek
Bank to GE for approximately $310 million in cash, plus certain assumed
liabilities, which option, if exercised, would provide CFN with a credit of $270
million to its $970 million bid.

          A consortium comprising Charlesbank Capital Partners, LLC
("Charlesbank") and EMC Mortgage Corporation ("EMC") made the second highest bid
at the auction for approximately $972.5 million plus certain assumed
liabilities, which includes the $30 million break-up fee to be paid to CFN
pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. CFC has agreed to pay $2
million to each of Charlesbank and EMC to compensate these parties for
concluding definitive purchase agreements to be effective in the event that CFC
is not able to close its proposed sale to CFN and GE.

          On March 6, 2003, CFC received an offer from Berkadia Equity Holdings,
L.L.C. that purported to be a bid in the recently concluded auction.
Concurrently therewith, Berkadia filed an objection to the sale that the
Bankruptcy Court heard, and summarily dismissed, on March 7, 2003. After further
negotiations during the March 7-14, 2003 period, CFN and GE significantly
increased the amount of cash to be paid for the CFC Assets. Ultimately, each of
the major constituencies, including the CFC Committee, the Ad Hoc Securitization
Holders' Committee, U.S. Bank as securitization trustee for the B-2 certificate
holders, and Federal National Mortgage Association, as a major B-2 certificate
holder, agreed to support the sale of the CFC Assets to CFN and GE. The total
value to be received as part of the transactions with CFN and GE upon closing is
expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, representing approximately $1.11
billion in cash and approximately $200 million in assumed liabilities, subject
to certain purchase price adjustments. On March 14, 2003, CFC entered into an
Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement with CFN (the "New CFN Agreement")
and into an Asset Purchase Agreement with GE (the "GE Agreement"). Also on March
14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the terms of the sale
of the CFC Assets free and clear of all liens pursuant to the New CFN Agreement
and the GE Agreement. The closing of the sale of the CFC Assets under the New
CFN Agreement and the GE Agreement is subject to various closing conditions, but
is currently expected to occur in May 2003.

          The Debtors believe that, considering all surrounding facts and
circumstances, the transactions with CFN and GE will maximize the value
obtainable from the CFC Assets for all relevant constituencies; however, there
can be no assurance that these transactions will be completed, or if completed,
that they will satisfy the Debtors' expectations. Assuming that the sale of the
CFC Assets is completed and CFC receives the proceeds from the sale of the CFC
Assets in the amount contemplated by the CFN and GE transactions, these proceeds
will be applied to satisfy CFC's obligations under its debtor-in-possession
credit agreements, administrative claims, priority claims and to its secured
creditors (including the 93/94 Notes and Lehman).

          As noted in Section II.B.1 above, certain parties have alleged that
the security interest granted to the 93/94 Notes pursuant to the "equal and
ratable" clause under the indenture governing such notes is defective.
Wilmington Trust Company, the indenture trustee under the 93/94 Notes, maintains
that any and all such allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit.
Invalidating such security interest will not be sufficient to provide for a
distribution of the CFC sale proceeds to CNC as owner of CFC. In addition, as
noted in Section II.B.2 above, the CFC Committee has alleged that Lehman's liens
against the Finance Company Debtors may be avoidable. Even if Lehman's liens are
voided, there will likely be no distribution to CNC as owner of CFC.

          As mentioned above, CFC also sought to restructure its manufactured
housing business. On December 18, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim
order granting the joint motion of CFC, Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. ("CFSC")
and U.S. Bank, as trustee for CFC's securitization trusts (the "Trustee"),
providing, for 30 business days, (i) for an increase of the MH Servicing Fee to
125 basis points per annum (the "Revised Servicing Fee") of the principal amount
outstanding of each manufactured housing securitization trust where the Trustee
acts as trustee; (ii) that the MH Servicing Fee be paid as an expense prior to
the distribution of any amounts in respect of certificates issued by each such
securitization

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

trust; and (iii) for a senior security interest in CFC's Manufactured Housing
servicing platform and a junior security interest in CFC's other assets in favor
of the Trustee for the benefit of itself and the corresponding
certificateholders (the "Adequate Protection Lien"), to secure (a) the continued
payment of certain of the Trustee's fees and expenses; (b) the amount, if any,
by which the Revised Servicing Fee exceeds the original servicing fee at the
contractual level of priority during the period of the interim order; and (c)
any losses to the securitization trusts relating to manufactured housing, home
equity and home improvement loans, credit card receivables and recreational
vehicle loans resulting from any misappropriation, misapplication or other
diversion of funds by the servicer.

          A hearing seeking final resolution of the matters covered by this
joint motion was held on January 29, 2003, and was subsequently continued
several times, because the Trustee, the CFC Committee, and the Ad Hoc
Securitization Holders' Committee were unable to consensually resolve the
servicing fee issues. In the interim, the parties did, however, agree to cap the
amount of the Adequate Protection Lien at $35 million. See "Summary of
Significant Motions - Motion to Increase CFC's Manufactured Housing
Securitization Servicing Fee."

          On February 19, 2003, due to the parties' inability to reach a
consensual solution to the issues regarding the MH Servicing Fee, CFC filed a
motion to reject the Servicing Agreements and the Sale Agreements (the "PSA
Rejection Motion"). As part of the overall settlement of the sale of the CFC
Assets, the Trustee, the CFC Committee, the Ad Hoc Securitization Holders'
Committee and the Finance Company Debtors ultimately resolved the MH Servicing
Fee issues and the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed final order at the Sale
Hearing on March 14, 2003. Concurrently therewith, the Finance Company Debtors
withdrew the PSA Rejection Motion.

          Overall, CFC is seeking to maximize the value obtainable from all
restructuring transactions it contemplates as part of its chapter 11 filing.
However, there can be no assurance that any transaction in connection therewith
will be completed. Moreover, if such a transaction is completed, it is highly
unlikely that that any proceeds resulting therefrom will be available to satisfy
any creditors other than creditors of CFC or parties with a security interest in
CFC's assets.

E.        PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

          The purpose of the Plan is to provide the Debtors with a capital
structure that can be supported by cash flows from operations. To that end, the
Plan will reduce CNC's debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations by more
than $5.0 billion and its future annual interest expense and distributions on
Trust Preferred Securities by approximately $380 million. The Debtors believe
that the reorganization contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of
their creditors as a whole. If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors believe
that they will be forced to either file an alternate plan of reorganization or
liquidate under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In either event, the Debtors
believe that their creditors would realize a less favorable distribution of
value, or in certain cases, no value at all, for their claims and equity
interests. See the Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit B.

F.        THE BUSINESS OF NEW CNC

          As a result of our efforts to divest our finance operations, we expect
that upon emergence from bankruptcy, or soon thereafter, we will be engaged
exclusively in the insurance business. For a description of our insurance
operations, see "Description of Conseco's Business -- The Company's Business."

          Following confirmation of the Plan, New CNC intends to operate two
distinct and separate insurance businesses, Conseco Insurance Group ("CIG") and
Bankers Life and Casualty Company ("Bankers Life").

          CIG is comprised of several insurance companies that serve over 3
million policyholders. CIG has historically offered a complete portfolio of
supplemental health insurance (long term care, Medicare supplement, specified
disease and group disability), life, and annuity products. CIG is moving forward
on a path to achieve a low cost, high performance service platform through
consolidation and simplification of its processes.

                                      -31-
<PAGE>


          Bankers Life is a 120-year-old health, life and annuity company
primarily focused on the needs of middle income senior citizens, the fastest
growing market segment in the U.S. Bankers Life offers this market a
comprehensive insurance product portfolio including long term care, Medicare
supplement, senior life and fixed annuities. Bankers Life distributes its
products through an exclusive career agency sales force of more than 3,500
agents and sales managers. Bankers Life is committed to become the nation's
leading provider of financial security for seniors. Its growth strategy is based
on leveraging its two well known highly regarded brands (Bankers Life and
Colonial Penn), increasing the productivity and size of its well-established,
broad-based career distribution organization, leveraging its core product
offerings by building or insourcing additional senior market insurance and
non-insurance products, and implementing key strategic technologies to increase
efficiency and productivity.

          We also expect that by virtue of certain reorganization transactions
described below in the section entitled "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences to CNC - Transfer of Assets from CNC to New CNC," our corporate
structure will be simplified upon confirmation of the Plan. An organization
chart depicting the anticipated corporate structure of New CNC and its
subsidiaries as of the Confirmation Date is attached hereto as Exhibit E.

G.        TERMS OF NEW SECURITIES AND NEW BANK DEBT TO BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE
          PLAN

          On the Effective Date, New CNC will issue for distribution, in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan, (i) the New CNC Common Stock, (ii)
the New CNC Preferred Stock, (iii) the New CNC Warrants and (iv) the New Senior
Notes (if any) (collectively, the "New CNC Securities"). New CNC will also enter
into a new senior secured credit facility on the Effective Date with Bank of
America, N.A., as agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "New Credit
Facility"). For purposes of determining the accrual of interest, dividends or
rights in respect of any other payment from and after the Effective Date, the
New CNC Securities and the New Credit Facility shall be deemed issued as of the
Effective Date regardless of the date on which they are actually dated,
authenticated or distributed; provided that New CNC shall withhold any actual
payment until such distribution is made and no interest shall accrue or
otherwise be payable on any such withheld amounts.

          The table set forth below identifies the anticipated post-Effective
Date allocation of New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC
Warrants. The table assumes the issuance of New CNC Common Stock to the Holders
of 93/94 Note Claims in lieu of the issuance of New Senior Notes and does not
give effect to the exercise of New CNC Warrants, the issuance of options or
other equity awards at or following the Effective Date pursuant to a new equity
incentive plan or the issuance of equity to certain professionals pursuant to
their engagement letters. In addition, the table assumes that Class 8A claims do
not exceed $140 million and Class 6B claims do not exceed $60 million and that
Class 10A and Class 11A-1 vote to accept the Plan.

                              conditions, together will all other events or
                              conditions, could reasonably be expected to have a
                              material adverse effect on New CNC and its

                              subsidiaries, and (xiii) downgrade by A.M. Best on
                              or after a Rating Testing Date (defined to include
                              each date when any portion of preferred stock is

                              a charge to write off any goodwill, provided that
                              in each case, notwithstanding the occurrence of a
                              Ratings Testing Date, no event of default will be
                              deemed to have occurred until the first date on
                              which New CNC would not have been in compliance
                              with the debt to total capitalization ratio or the
                              minimum EBITDA covenant).

Mandatory Prepayments:        New CNC is required to make prepayments under the
                              New Credit Facility with all or a portion of the
                              proceeds from the following transactions or
                              events: (i) the net proceeds arising from the
                              incurrence of certain indebtedness by New CNC or
                              its subsidiaries, (ii) the net proceeds arising
                              from the issuance of certain equity interests by
                              New CNC or its subsidiaries, (iii) the net
                              proceeds arising from the sales of certain assets
                              by New CNC or its subsidiaries or the occurrence
                              of casualty events, where the net proceeds of such
                              asset sales or casualty events exceed $2.5 million
                              in any fiscal year, (iv) recoveries on collateral
                              by New CNC or its subsidiaries securing certain
                              existing indebtedness, (v) repayments of the D&O
                              Credit Facilities, and (vi) receipt of cash flows
                              above certain levels. The priority and order of
                              application of such prepayments will be as set
                              forth in the credit agreement governing the New
                              Credit Facility.


H.        BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NEW CNC

          The board of directors of New CNC will consist of seven members,
including two members from senior management and five outside members selected
by the Conseco Creditors Committee. The Restated CNC Charter will provide that
the board of directors of New CNC shall be divided into two classes of
directors, with the initial Class I directors serving for a term expiring at the
next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Date and
the initial Class II directors serving for a term expiring at the second
succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Date. Other
than the term for the initial Class II directors, the term of each class of
directors shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.

          The board of directors of New CNC will appoint the board of directors
of Reorganized CIHC. In accordance with section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors will file and serve a notice setting

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

forth the officers and Directors of the Debtors no later than ten (10) calendar
days before the Confirmation Date, and will specify the Class for directors of
New CNC. The Debtors will serve the notice upon: (i) the US Trustee, (ii) the
Core Group (as defined in the then current Case Management Procedures approved
by the Bankruptcy Court), and (iii) parties who have requested notice pursuant
to Rule 2002 of the Bankruptcy Rules. Notice will be served in the manner set
forth in the then current Case Management Procedures.

I.        LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS

          Pursuant to section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code (sometimes
called the "Best Interests Test"), each Holder of an Impaired Claim or Impaired
Equity Interest must either (a) accept the Plan or (b) receive or retain under
the Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than
the value such Holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on the Effective Date. The first step in
meeting this test is to determine the proceeds that would be generated from the
hypothetical liquidation of the Debtors' assets and properties in the context of
a chapter 7 liquidation case. This "liquidation value" would consist primarily
of the proceeds from a sale of the Debtors' assets by a chapter 7 trustee. The
gross amount of cash and cash equivalents ("Cash") available would be the sum of
the proceeds from the disposition of the Debtors' assets and the Cash held by
the Debtors at the time of the commencement of the chapter 7 case. Such amount
is reduced by the amount of any Claims secured by such assets, the costs and
expenses of the liquidation, and such additional administrative expenses and
priority claims that may result from the termination of the Debtors' business
and the use of chapter 7 for the purposes of a hypothetical liquidation. Any
remaining net Cash would be allocated to creditors and stockholders in strict
priority in accordance with section 726 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          The Debtors believe that the Plan will produce a greater recovery for
Holders of Claims and Equity Interests than would be achieved in a chapter 7
liquidation. The Company has prepared a liquidation analysis (the "Liquidation
Analysis"), set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto, to assist Holders of Claims
and Equity Interests to reach a determination as to whether to accept or reject
the Plan. This Liquidation Analysis estimates the proceeds to be realized if CNC
were to be liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This Liquidation
Analysis does not take into account CFC or include estimated proceeds, if any,
from a sale or liquidation of the Company's investment in CFC. The Liquidation
Analysis is based upon projected assets and liabilities of CNC as of June 1,
2003 and incorporates estimates and assumptions developed by CNC which are
subject to potentially material changes with respect to economic and business
conditions, as well as uncertainties not within its control.

          As noted above, the Company believes that under the Plan each holder
of Impaired Claims and Equity Interests will receive distributions with a value
not less than the value such holder would receive in a liquidation under chapter
7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This belief is based primarily upon (i) consideration
of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the ultimate proceeds
available for distribution to creditors including, but not limited to, (a) the
increased costs and expenses of a liquidation under chapter 7 arising from fees
payable to a chapter 7 trustee and advisors to the trustee, (b) any erosion in
value of assets in a chapter 7 case in the context of the liquidation required
under chapter 7 and the "forced sale" atmosphere that would likely prevail, in
part due to the pressure likely to be asserted by state insurance regulators to
conclude the process as expeditiously as possible, (c) any adverse effects on
the Company's businesses as a result of the likely departure of key employees,
(d) any reduction of value associated with a chapter 7 trustee's operation of
the Company's businesses, and (e) any substantial delay in distributions to
Holders in connection with a chapter 7 liquidation, and (ii) the Liquidation
Analysis. Holders of Impaired Claims and Equity Interests should note that the
Liquidation Analysis does not reflect any delay in distributions to creditors in
a liquidation scenario, which, if considered, would only further reduce the
present value of any liquidation proceeds. Insurance regulatory authorities have
broad regulatory and supervisory powers over CNC's insurance subsidiaries,
including their operations and transactions with affiliates. This regulation and
supervision is primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders, and it
includes the authority to take control of these assets if deemed necessary to
protect policyholders. In such an event, the existing claimants of CNC may not
receive any recovery on their Claims or Equity Interests or may experience
significant time delays in receiving a recovery.

                                      -40-
<PAGE>


         The Debtors believe that any liquidation analysis is speculative
because such an analysis is necessarily premised upon assumptions and estimates
that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many
of which would be beyond their control. Thus, there can be no assurance as to
values that would actually be realized or that a sale could, in fact, be
consummated in a chapter 7 liquidation, nor can there be any assurance that the
Bankruptcy Court would accept the conclusions set forth in the Liquidation
Analysis or concur with assumptions made therein for purposes of section
1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, the Liquidation Analysis
necessarily contains an estimate of the amount of Claims that will ultimately
become Allowed Claims. This estimate is based solely upon the a review of the
Company's books and records and estimates as to additional Claims, if any, that
may be filed in the Chapter 11 Case(s) or that would arise in the event of a
conversion of the case(s) from chapter 11 to chapter 7. No order or finding has
been entered by the Bankruptcy Court fixing the amount of Claims at the
projected amounts of Allowed Claims set forth in the Liquidation Analysis. In
preparing the Liquidation Analysis, the Company has projected an amount of
Allowed Claims that is at the lower end of a range of reasonableness such that,
for purposes of the Liquidation Analysis, the largest possible liquidation
dividend to holders of Allowed Claims can be assessed. The estimate of the
amount of Allowed Claims set forth in the Liquidation Analysis should not be
relied upon for any other purpose, including, without limitation, any
determination of the value of any distribution to be made on account of Allowed
Claims or Interests under the Plan. The Liquidation Analysis is provided solely
to disclose to holders the effects of a hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation of
CNC, subject to the assumptions set forth therein.

          To the extent that confirmation of the Plan requires the establishment
of amounts for the chapter 7 liquidation value of CNC, funds available to pay
Claims, and the reorganization value of CNC, the Bankruptcy Court will determine
those amounts at the Confirmation Hearing. Accordingly, the annexed Liquidation
Analysis is provided solely to disclose to Holders the effects of a hypothetical
chapter 7 liquidation of CNC, subject to the assumptions set forth therein.

          The Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto does
not speculate as to the outcome of any potential causes of action the Debtors or
Holders of Claims may have nor does it, therefore, include any estimate of the
necessary expenses to litigate such claims.

J.        FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND VALUATION ANALYSIS

          In conjunction with the allocation of distributions under the Plan,
the Company determined that it was necessary to estimate post-confirmation
reorganization values of New CNC to provide for equitable distribution among
Holders of Allowed Claims and Equity Interests. Accordingly, the Company's
management developed a set of financial projections, summarized below and in
Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Projections"). The Company has also directed
Lazard to prepare a valuation analysis of New CNC. The Projections, prepared by
the Company's management as set forth in Exhibit C and the valuation set forth
below are based on a number of significant assumptions, including, among other
things, the successful reorganization of the Company, the sale or liquidation of
the Company's investment in CFC, the Company's ability to achieve the operating
and financial results set forth in the Projections, the Company's ability to
obtain satisfactory ratings for its insurance subsidiaries from A.M. Best, and
the assumption that capital and equity market conditions remain consistent with
current conditions.

          THE PROJECTIONS ARE BASED UPON A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS.
ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS AND VALUES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PROJECTIONS.

          1.   Financial Projections

          As a condition to confirmation of a plan, the Bankruptcy Code
requires, among other things, the Bankruptcy Court to determine that
confirmation is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further
reorganization of the debtor. In connection with the development of the Plan and
for purposes of determining whether the Plan satisfies this feasibility
standard, the Company's management, together with Lazard, has analyzed (taking
into account the Projections) the ability of New CNC to meet its obligations
under the Plan to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to conduct
its business.

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

The Projections were also prepared by the Company's management to assist each
Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest in determining whether to accept
or reject the Plan.

          The Projections should be read in conjunction with the assumptions,
qualifications and footnotes to tables containing the Projections set forth
herein and in Exhibit C, the historical consolidated financial information
(including the notes and schedules thereto) and the other information set forth
in Conseco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001 and Conseco's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March
31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, the full texts of which are
incorporated herein by reference. The Projections were prepared in good faith
based upon estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Projections
were prepared by the Company's management in December 2002, and were based in
part on economic, competitive and general business conditions prevailing at that
time. Any future changes in these conditions may materially impact the ability
of the Company to achieve the Projections.

          THE PROJECTIONS WERE NOT PREPARED WITH A VIEW TOWARDS COMPLIANCE WITH
GUIDELINES FOR PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN
INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS. THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR HAS
NEITHER COMPILED NOR EXAMINED THE ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION
TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS THEREOF AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS NOT EXPRESSED AN
OPINION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT THERETO.

          THE COMPANY DOES NOT, AS A MATTER OF COURSE, PUBLISH ITS Projections.
ACCORDINGLY, THE Debtors DO NOT INTEND TO, AND EACH DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO,
(I) FURNISH UPDATED PROJECTIONS TO HOLDERS OF ALLOWED CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS
PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OR TO HOLDERS OF NEW preferred stock, NEW COMMON
STOCK or NEW CNC WARRANTS OR ANY OTHER PARTY AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, (II)
INCLUDE SUCH UPDATED INFORMATION IN ANY DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE
FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR (III) OTHERWISE MAKE SUCH
UPDATED INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

          THE PROJECTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THE EXHIBITS
HERETO HAVE BEEN PREPARED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. THESE
PROJECTIONS, WHILE PRESENTED WITH NUMERICAL SPECIFICITY, ARE NECESSARILY BASED
ON A VARIETY OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WHICH, THOUGH CONSIDERED REASONABLE BY
MANAGEMENT, MAY NOT BE REALIZED, AND ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF
WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. THE COMPANY CAUTIONS THAT NO
REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE MADE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THESE PROJECTIONS AND RELATED
INFORMATION OR AS TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECTED RESULTS.
SOME ASSUMPTIONS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE AND EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING
SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE ON WHICH THESE PROJECTIONS WERE PREPARED MAY BE DIFFERENT
FROM THOSE ASSUMED OR MAY BE UNANTICIPATED, AND THUS MAY AFFECT FINANCIAL
RESULTS IN A MATERIAL AND POSSIBLY ADVERSE MANNER. THE PROJECTIONS AND RELATED
INFORMATION, THEREFORE, MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON AS A GUARANTY OR OTHER ASSURANCE
OF THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WILL OCCUR.

          FINALLY, THE PROJECTIONS INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE ENTERPRISE
VALUE OF NEW CNC, THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND ITS LIABILITIES AS OF THE
EFFECTIVE DATE. NEW CNC WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH ESTIMATIONS AS OF THE
EFFECTIVE DATE. SUCH DETERMINATION WILL BE BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUES AS OF THAT
DATE, WHICH COULD BE MATERIALLY GREATER OR LESS THAN THE VALUES ASSUMED IN THE
ESTIMATES CONTAINED HEREIN.

          2.   Valuation Methodologies

          In preparing an enterprise valuation of New CNC, Lazard performed a
variety of analyses and considered a variety of factors. Lazard primarily relied
on two generally accepted valuation methodologies for estimating New CNC's
enterprise value: selected comparable companies analysis and actuarial valuation
analysis. Lazard placed different weights on each of these analyses and made
judgments as to the relative significance of each analysis in determining New
CNC's indicated enterprise value. Lazard did not consider any one analysis or
factor to the exclusion of any other analysis or factor. Lazard's valuation must
be considered as a whole and selecting just one methodology or portions of the
analyses, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create a misleading
or incomplete conclusion as to New CNC's enterprise value.

               (a)  Selected Comparable Companies Analysis

          The selected comparable companies analysis, performed by Lazard,
calculates certain financial information, ratios and public market multiples
relating to a group of publicly traded companies engaged in businesses generally
similar to those to be conducted by New CNC and compares them to certain
financial information and ratios relating to New CNC. This analysis includes,
among other factors, comparisons of each company's historical and projected
financial results, profitability, returns, leverage, ratings and business
composition. Ranges of certain ratios and public market multiples are then
applied to New CNC's projected financial results to derive an implied range of
enterprise values for New CNC. Lazard placed different weights on each of these
ratios and multiples and made judgments as to the relative significance of each
in determining New CNC's enterprise value range.

          Criteria for selecting comparable companies include, among other
characteristics, similar lines of businesses, business risks, growth prospects,
size and scale of operations. Of course, the selection of comparable companies
is subject to limitations related to the comparison of companies that do not
share identical financial, business and operational characteristics with New
CNC.

               (b)  Actuarial Valuation Analysis

          The actuarial valuation analysis, which was developed by the Company's
actuaries and outside consulting actuaries, Milliman USA, derives a value range
based on the adjusted net worth and the discounted projected future cash flows
of New CNC's underlying insurance businesses. Lazard, utilizing information
provided by the Company's management, subsequently made certain adjustments to
the summary actuarial valuation results for certain assets and liabilities of
the Company, that were not included in the actuarial appraisal. The actuarial
appraisal of the insurance company subsidiaries of CNC, prepared by the
Company's outside consulting actuaries, is available for viewing at
www.bmccorp.net. In order to fully comprehend this report, any user of this
report should be advised by an actuary with a substantial level of expertise in
areas relevant to this analysis to appreciate the significance of the underlying
assumptions and the impact of those assumptions on the illustrated results. This
report must be read in its entirety to be understood.

          3.   Reorganization Value

         THE ESTIMATES OF THE REORGANIZATION VALUE PREPARED BY LAZARD REPRESENT
THE HYPOTHETICAL REORGANIZATION ENTERPRISE VALUE OF NEW CNC. SUCH ESTIMATES
REFLECT COMPUTATIONS OF THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATED REORGANIZATION ENTERPRISE
VALUE OF NEW CNC THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND DO
NOT PURPORT TO REFLECT OR CONSTITUTE APPRAISALS, LIQUIDATION VALUES OR ESTIMATES
OF THE ACTUAL MARKET VALUE THAT MAY BE REALIZED THROUGH THE SALE OF ANY
SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE PLAN, WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH HEREIN.

          The Company has been advised by Lazard, its financial advisor, with
respect to the reorganization value of New CNC on a going concern basis. Solely
for purposes of the Plan, the estimated range of

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

enterprise value of New CNC was assumed to be approximately $3,700 million to
$3,900 million (with a midpoint value of $3,800 million) as of an assumed
Effective Date of June 1, 2003. After deducting from New CNC's enterprise value
the assumed long-term indebtedness of New CNC at the assumed Effective Date,
consisting of $1,388 million of new long-term indebtedness, the estimated range
of total equity value of New CNC was assumed to be approximately $2,312 million
to $2,512 million (with a midpoint value of $2,412 million). After deducting
from New CNC's total equity value the assumed value of the New CNC Preferred
Stock at the assumed Effective Date of $808 million (which amount gives effect
to accrued interest on the Senior Credit Facility and the 1999 D&O Credit
Facility through the assumed Effective Date that would be satisfied in the form
of New CNC Preferred Stock), the estimated range of common equity value of New
CNC was assumed to be approximately $1,504 million to $1,704 million (with a
midpoint value of $1,604 million). This analysis assumes that the approximately
$88 million of 93/94 Note Claims will be reinstated as long-term indebtedness;
in the event that the 93/94 Notes receive equity in satisfaction of their claims
versus debt, the assumed equity value ranges assumed herein would increase
accordingly. This analysis also does not take into account the Company's
investment in CFC, which the Company intends to sell or liquidate, or include
estimated proceeds, if any, from such sale or liquidation. Additionally, this
analysis does not take into account the value of the New CNC Warrants that are
to be issued under the Plan.

          The assumed range of the reorganization value as of an assumed
Effective Date of June 1, 2003 reflects work performed by Lazard prior to the
initial filing of the Disclosure Statement and on the basis of information with
respect to the business and certain assets and liabilities of New CNC available
to Lazard as of December 2002. In addition, the assumed range of the
reorganization value does not include projected recoveries from obligors of the
D&O Credit Facilities or other causes of action because the value of such claims
is speculative.

          Lazard's analyses did not address any other aspect of the proposed
restructuring or any related transactions or constitute a recommendation to any
holder of outstanding securities of the Debtors as to how such security holder
should vote or act on any matter relating to the restructuring or any related
transaction. In addition, neither Lazard's valuation analysis nor its estimated
total enterprise value for New CNC constitute an opinion as to the fairness to
holders of outstanding securities of the Debtors from a financial point of view
of the consideration to be received by such security holders pursuant to the
Plan. Lazard does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
analysis or its estimated total enterprise value for New CNC.

          In preparing its analyses, Lazard, among other things: (i) reviewed
certain historical financial information of the Company for the recent years and
interim periods; (ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating data of
the Company including financial projections prepared and provided by the
Company's management relating to its business and its prospects; (iii) met with
certain members of senior management of the Company to discuss the Company's
operations and future prospects; (iv) reviewed certain publicly available
financial data and considered the market value of certain public companies
believed to be generally comparable to New CNC in one or more respects; (v)
considered certain economic and industry information relevant to the operating
business; and (vi) reviewed such other information and conducted such other
studies, analyses, inquiries, and investigations as Lazard deemed appropriate.
Although Lazard conducted a review and analysis of the Company's business,
operating assets and liabilities and New CNC's business plans, it assumed and
relied on the accuracy and completeness of all: (i) financial and other
information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company, including without
limitation, information provided by the Company's actuaries and outside
consulting actuaries; and (ii) publicly available information. In addition,
Lazard assumed and relied upon the reasonableness and accuracy of management's
projections, and no independent valuations or appraisals of the Company were
sought or obtained in connection herewith. In addition, Lazard is not an actuary
and Lazard's services and analyses referenced herein do not constitute actuarial
determinations or evaluations or any evaluation of actuarial assumptions. In
addition, and not withstanding the foregoing, the Company's outside consulting
actuaries would only provide its materials to Lazard on the condition that
Lazard agree not to rely upon them in a manner that created a legal duty from
the outside consulting actuaries to Lazard or bring any claim against the
outside consulting actuaries. As a result, there can be no assurance with
respect to any actuarial information or information derived therefrom.

          The value of an operating business is subject to numerous
uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult to predict, and will
fluctuate with changes in factors affecting the financial condition and
prospects of that business. As a result, the estimate of the range of the
reorganization enterprise value of New CNC set forth herein is not necessarily
indicative of actual outcomes, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those set forth herein. Since such estimates are inherently subject to
uncertainties, neither the Company, Lazard, nor any other person assumes
responsibility for their accuracy. In addition, the valuation of newly-issued
securities is subject to additional uncertainties and contingencies, all of
which are difficult to predict. New CNC intends to apply to list the New CNC
Preferred Stock, the New CNC Common Stock and the New CNC Warrants on a national
securities exchange or on NASDAQ. There can be no assurance, however, that these
securities will be so listed and, if so listed, that an active trading market
would develop. Actual market prices of these securities at issuance will depend
upon, among other things, prevailing interest rates, conditions in the financial
markets, the anticipated initial securities holdings of prepetition creditors,
some of which may prefer to liquidate their investment rather than hold it on a
long-term basis, and other factors which generally influence the prices of
securities.

          4.   The Company's Prior Valuation Analyses of its Insurance
               Businesses

          Prior to retaining Lazard, in connection with the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), the Company's outside consulting actuaries (the
same outside consulting actuaries retained to develop the actuarial valuation
analysis described above) and a nationally-recognized "big four" accounting firm
had been retained under separate engagements to assist with determining the
value of the Company's insurance businesses as of December 31, 2001. Based on
the work performed by the Company and these actuaries and accountants, the value
of the Company's insurance businesses, as of December 31, 2001, was estimated by
the Company to be approximately $5.9 billion (the "Goodwill Recoverability
Analysis"). There are a number of events that have occurred subsequent to
December 31, 2001 that cause the Company to believe that the Goodwill
Recoverability Analysis no longer reflects the current financial, business and
operating condition of the Company's insurance businesses. These events, the
financial, business and operating impact of which was not incorporated into the
Goodwill Recoverability Analysis as of December 31, 2001, include, among other
things: (i) reductions in expected future new business and increases in expected
future lapses and surrenders of existing business due to downgrades by rating
agencies; (ii) reductions in the value of existing business due to reinsurance
transactions; (iii) reductions in capital due to dividend payments; (iv)
reductions in capital due to net losses realized in 2002, primarily due to
investment impairments and increases to insurance liabilities; (v) reduction in
the value of new and existing business due to the lower interest rates; (vi)
reductions in market values for insurance businesses, as evidenced by recent
selected reinsurance transactions and the sales of insurance businesses; and
(vii) reductions in the value of existing business due to higher surrenders and
lapses. As a result of these subsequent events, the Company does not believe
that the December 31, 2001 Goodwill Recoverability Analysis is useful or
meaningful in evaluating the current value of the Company.



                                      III.
        INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIPS AND PROPOSED TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY
                             CLAIMS UNDER THE PLAN

          CNC and its subsidiaries have a number of intercompany arrangements
and relationships, including the following:

A.        SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS

          Conseco Services, an affiliate of the Reorganizing Debtors, provides
the Reorganizing Debtors with administrative services under various service
agreements (the "Service Agreements"). Pursuant to the Service Agreements,
Conseco Services provides the Reorganizing Debtors with administrative services
needed for the conduct of their businesses and incurs expenses and costs
associated therewith, including, among others, salaries, bonuses, payroll and
other taxes, employee benefits, reimbursements, consulting and professional
fees, vendor payments and insurance premiums. The Reorganizing Debtors pay
Conseco

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

Services an amount equal to such costs and expenses plus a 10% service fee. The
Reorganizing Debtors advance Conseco Services approximately $2 million per month
in the aggregate under the Service Agreements. Conseco Services provides certain
benefits to employees of the Finance Company Debtors and services to the Finance
Company Debtors. Any claims between Conseco Services and the Finance Company
Debtors would be resolved under the setoff provision of the Plan.

B.        Intercompany Obligations

          Other than (i) any Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims (as defined
below), (ii) Net Reorganizing Debtors Claims (as defined below) or (iii) unless
otherwise indicated, all intercompany amounts owed by the Reorganizing Debtors
or the Finance Company Debtors to other Reorganizing Debtors, Finance Company
Debtors or affiliated non-Debtors in respect of loans, notes, and intercompany
cash transfers will be cancelled under the Plan. See "Summary of the Plan of
Reorganization - Classification and Treatment of Claims and Equity Interests."
The intercompany claims that will be expressly reinstated under the Plan are set
forth on Exhibit G attached hereto.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries must maintain minimum
capitalization levels under various regulatory requirements. Accordingly,
certain intercompany amounts owing to the insurance subsidiaries by the Debtors
will not be cancelled. The intercompany claims that will be cancelled under the
Plan are set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto.

          Specifically, CNC and CIHC owe intercompany obligations to five
insurance company subsidiaries: Conseco Life Insurance Company ("Conseco Life"),
Conseco Annuity Assurance Company ("Conseco Annuity"), Bankers Life, Bankers
National Life Insurance Company ("Bankers National") and Washington National
Insurance Company ("Washington National") (collectively, the "Insurance
Subsidiaries").

          As described in the Section entitled "General Information -
Description of Conseco's Business - Government Regulation," insurance companies
are subject to extensive regulation. CNC and CIHC have issued the Insurance
Subsidiaries several series of preferred stock, some of which positively affects
the Insurance Subsidiaries' RBC ratios and capitalization.

          CNC has issued $900 million principal amount Series E Preferred Stock
to Bankers National. Because the Series E Preferred Stock is not listed as an
admitted asset on the statutory balance sheet of Bankers National, this stock
will be cancelled under the Plan.

          CIHC has issued three series of preferred stock to the Insurance
Subsidiaries: (i) the 1994 Series Preferred Stock, held by Bankers Life, Conseco
Annuity and Conseco Life; (ii) the 1998 Series Preferred Stock, held by Bankers
Life, Conseco Life, and Washington National; and (iii) the $2.32 Preferred
Stock, held by Conseco Life. The foregoing series of preferred stock are
collectively referred to herein as the "Regulated CIHC Preferred Stock". The
Regulated CIHC Preferred Stock constitutes admitted assets on the statutory
balance sheets of each Insurance Subsidiary holding such stock. Accordingly,
this stock, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of this
stock, will be reinstated under the Plan with the same admitted values as
existed immediately prior to the Petition Date.

C.        CLAIMS BETWEEN FINANCE COMPANY DEBTORS AND REORGANIZING DEBTORS

          As of the Petition Date, CFC owed CIHC $277,376,671 under a promissory
note (the "CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note"), and CIHC owed CFC $315,030,986 under a
separate note (the "CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note"). The net prepetition balance
owing by CIHC to CFC under those two notes is $37,654,315 (the "PrePetition Note
Balance"). CIHC holds other prepetition claims against CFC. In addition, on and
after the Petition Date, CIHC has funded certain expenses incurred on behalf of
the Finance Company Debtors (the "Advanced Funds"). Certain first day orders
entered in the Reorganizing Debtors' and Finance Company Debtors' jointly
administered bankruptcy cases may entitle one or more of the Reorganizing
Debtors to a super-priority administrative claim in the Finance Company Debtors'
cases.

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

          Except as expressly provided for in the Plan, each Reorganizing Debtor
and Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code
(including, without limitation, section 553) or applicable non-bankruptcy law or
as may be agreed to by the Holder of a Claim, set off against any Allowed Claim
or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant hereto on account
of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is made on
account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor, as the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests,
rights or Causes of Action against such Holder have not been compromised or
settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise); provided that, neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims,
Equity Interests, rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distributions contemplated by the Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note and any other claims CFC may hold against CIHC shall
be offset against: (i) the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note, (ii) all other
prepetition amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all postpetition amounts owed by CFC
that are not repaid in full in Cash by CFC, including, without limitation,
health and welfare benefits, insurance, other direct CFC expenses and an
appropriate allocation (which allocation will be filed by the Reorganizing
Debtors 10 days prior to the Confirmation Hearing) of the postpetition
professional fees paid by CIHC except to the extent that prior to Confirmation,
the Bankruptcy Court determines by Final Order that such setoff or treatment may
not be allowed under applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code). Any balance
of the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note remaining after giving effect to all the
setoffs in the preceding sentence (the "Net CFC Claims") will be Class 6B
Claims.

          In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Finance
Company Debtors all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Finance Company Debtors
to the Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts owing
under the prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) amounts owing as a result of
payments made on behalf of the Finance Company Debtors to ExlServices.com, Inc.
("Exl"), (iii) an appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees
incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors in connection
with their restructuring and the preparation for these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv)
prepetition amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco Services or
CIHC, and (y) postpetition amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full in Cash, including without
limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments owed by the Finance Company
Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the postpetition professional fees
incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors during these Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) any
postpetition payments by the Reorganizing Debtors to Exl pursuant to the
guarantee by CNC of a transition services agreement between Exl and CFC, and
(iv) postpetition amounts owed by the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco
Services or CIHC except to the extent that prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy
Court determines by Final Order that such setoff or treatment may not be allowed
under applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code). Claims (if any) of Finance
Company Debtors against Reorganizing Debtors that continue to be outstanding
after such offsets as well as any Net CFC Claims are referred to herein
collectively as "Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims." To the extent any Net
Finance Company Debtors' Claims are Allowed Claims against CNC they will be
Class 8A Claims. For purposes of this Article III.B, "Net Reorganizing Debtors'
Claims" means any and all Claims held by any of the Reorganizing Debtors or any
of their affiliates against the Finance Company Debtors after effecting any and
all of the offsets described above. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
the Plan, all such Net Reorganizing Debtors' Claims shall be preserved and
unaffected by the confirmation of the Plan.

          On February 19, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order granting
the Finance Company Debtors through April 1, 2003 to file proofs of claim
against the Reorganizing Debtors. The Reorganizing Debtors have been advised by
the Finance Company Debtors that they are presently engaged in investigations to
determine the bases for, and valuation of, intercompany claims they may hold
against the Reorganizing Debtors. The Finance Company Debtors believe that it is
possible that the investigations will

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

yield additional information regarding the intercompany obligations which may
necessitate adjustments to the amounts of the PrePetition Note Balance, the
Advanced Funds, Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims and/or Net Reorganizing
Debtors' Claims. The Reorganizing Debtors are presently engaged in
investigations to determine the basis for, and valuation of, any additional
intercompany claims that they may hold against the Finance Company Debtors. The
CFC Committee likewise is investigating all intercompany claims held by the
Finance Company Debtors and has raised concerns regarding the offset of
prepetition amounts against postpetition amounts between the Debtors and the
Finance Company Debtors.

                                      IV.
                 SUMMARY OF OTHER DEBTORS AND REASONS FOR FILING

          In addition to CNC and CIHC, certain of their affiliates filed for
chapter 11 on the Petition Date. CTIHC, Inc. and Partners Health Group, Inc.
filed for chapter 11 to address certain liabilities against them.

                                       V.
                              THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

          On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief
under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. At such time, all actions and
proceedings against the Debtors and all acts to obtain property from the Debtors
were stayed under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors will continue
to conduct their businesses and manage their properties as debtors in possession
pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.

A.        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT MOTIONS

          The following summarizes significant motions that have been filed in
the Chapter 11 Cases. You can view these motions at www.bmccorp.net/conseco.

          1.   Applications for Retention of Reorganizing Debtors' and Finance
               Company Debtors' Professionals

          On January 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the retention of
certain professionals to represent and assist the Reorganizing Debtors and the
Finance Company Debtors in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. These
professionals were intimately involved with the negotiation and development of
the Plan. These professionals include, among others: (a) Kirkland & Ellis, as
counsel for the Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors; (b) Lazard
Freres & Co., LLC as financial advisor for the Reorganizing Debtors and Finance
Company Debtors; (c) Bankruptcy Management Corporation, as notice agent for the
Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors: and (d) Bridge Associates, LLC
as crisis managers for the Finance Company Debtors. The Bankruptcy Court also
approved a request to retain other professionals to assist the Reorganizing
Debtors and Finance Company Debtors in other ongoing matters. These
professionals include, but are not limited to: (i) Baker Botts, LLC as special
SEC counsel to the Debtors and Finance Company Debtors; (ii)
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as accountants to the Debtors and Finance Company
Debtors; (iii) Gregory P. Joseph Law Offices, LLC as special litigation counsel
to the Debtors and Finance Company Debtors; (iv) Milliman USA Inc. to provide
actuarial and valuation services to the Reorganizing Debtors: (v) Baker &
Daniels, as special corporate counsel to the Reorganizing Debtors; and (vi)
Dorsey & Whitney LLP, as special corporate and securitization counsel to the
Finance Company Debtors.

          2.   Motion to Continue Using Existing Bank Accounts and Business
               Forms

          The Bankruptcy Court has authorized the Reorganizing Debtors' and
Finance Company Debtors' continued use of their respective bank accounts.
Additionally, the Reorganizing Debtors have historically received services from
their subsidiary Conseco Services pursuant to the Service Agreements. Pursuant
to the Service Agreements, Conseco Services provides the Reorganizing Debtors
with administrative services needed for the conduct of the Reorganizing Debtors'
businesses and incurs expenses and costs including salaries, bonuses, payroll
and other taxes, employee benefits, reimbursements, consulting and professional
fees, vendor payments and insurance premiums. The Reorganizing Debtors pay
Conseco Services an

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

amount equal to such costs and expenses plus a 10% service fee. The Bankruptcy
Court has authorized the Reorganizing Debtors to continue using Conseco Services
in this manner.

          3.   Motion to Pay Employee Wages and Associated Benefits

          The Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors believe that
their employees are a valuable asset and that any delay in paying prepetition or
postpetition compensation or benefits to their employees would destroy their
relationship with employees and irreparably harm employee morale at a time when
the dedication, confidence and cooperation of their employees is most critical.
The Bankruptcy Court granted the Reorganizing Debtors' request for authority to
pay all compensation and benefits owed to employees through Conseco Services. In
addition, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Finance Company Debtors' request for
authority to pay all compensation and benefits to their employees. The authority
granted allows the Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors to
compensate their employees for obligations payable as of the Petition Date, as
well as obligations that come due after the Petition Date.

          4.   Motion to Increase CFC's Manufactured Housing Securitization
               Servicing Fee

          The Finance Company Debtors filed this motion jointly with U.S. Bank,
as trustee ("Trustee") for certain manufactured housing securitization trusts
(the "MH Securitization Trusts"), on the Petition Date. The joint motion
requested the Bankruptcy Court to order a temporary increase, for a period of
thirty (30) business days, in the amount of the monthly servicing fee paid to
CFC or CFSC as servicers of the MH Securitization Trusts to 1/12 of 125 basis
points per annum and the priority of such payments (the "Revised Servicing Fee")
as an expense prior to the distribution of any amounts in respect of
certificates issued by the MH Securitization Trusts.

          Pursuant to the joint motion, CFC and CFSC have granted a senior
security interest in CFC's Manufactured Housing platform and a junior security
interest in CFC's other assets in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of itself
and the corresponding certificateholders, to secure (i) the continued payment of
certain of the Trustee's fees and expenses; (ii) the amount, if any, by which
the Revised Servicing Fee exceeds the original servicing fee at the contractual
level of priority during the period of the requested interim order; and (iii)
any losses to the securitization trusts relating to manufactured housing, home
equity and home improvement loans, credit card receivables and recreational
vehicle loans resulting from any misappropriation, misapplication or other
diversion of funds by the servicer.

          The Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order granting the requested
relief, with the final hearing scheduled for February 12, 2003. On February 12,
2003, the matter was continued to February 19, 2003 and subsequently to February
21, 2003. On February 21, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order resetting
the final hearing date to March 5, 2003, which was continued until March 13,
2003, and continuing the first interim order until the final hearing, with the
exception that the security interest provided under the first interim order was
capped at $35 million and the parties agreed that the security interest would no
longer accrue additional amounts. On March 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order resolving all issues relating to the foregoing matters as part
of a global settlement among the parties in connection with the approval of the
sale of the CFC Assets to CFN and GE.

          5.   Motion to Enter into Commitment Letter and Approving Interim
               Commitment Fee and Expense Reimbursement to Replacement DIP
               Lenders

          On February 25, 2003, after negotiations and with the support of the
CFC Committee, the Finance Company Debtors filed an emergency motion with the
Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to (i) enter into a commitment letter
with a syndicate of entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners under
which the Finance Company Debtors are granted the option to enter into $845
million in postpetition financing; (ii) pay $5 million in lieu of reimbursement
for expenses incurred in preparing the financing and (iii) pay an interim
commitment fee of $3.75 million. On February 26, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order granting the authorization sought in the Finance Company
Debtors' emergency motion. The $5 million expense reimbursement and $3.75
million commitment fee are super-priority administrative claims under sections
364(c)(1), 503(b) and 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On March 5, 2003, the
Finance Company Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court for a final
order authorizing the

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

exercise of the option to enter into the postpetition financing. A final hearing
to approve the financing has been set for March 20, 2003.

          6.   Motions for Authority to Continue the Key Employee Retention
               Program

          The Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors believe that it
is imperative to stabilize their workforce at this critical juncture of the
Chapter 11 Cases to ensure that the necessary complement of employees required
to proceed with the Debtors' reorganization are in place. On January 14, 2003
(with respect to the Finance Company Debtors and on January 29, 2003 (with
respect to the Reorganizing Debtors), the Bankruptcy Court granted the request
for authority to continue, and approved the terms of, an enhanced key employee
retention program. In addition, on or about January 31, 2003, the Reorganizing
Debtors filed a motion to implement a key employee retention program for their
senior management (the "Senior Management KERP"). On February 21, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court granted the Senior Management KERP motion authorizing the
Reorganizing Debtors to implement a key employee retention program for certain
senior management that has three components: (i) a bonus upon emergence from
chapter 11, (ii) an annual bonus and (iii) severance. Subsequent to the granting
of this motion, Ms. Elizabeth Georgakopoulos, president of Conseco Insurance
Group, separated from the Company. Although the board of directors of CNC is
authorized to make further payments to her under the Senior Management KERP, the
Company did not implement the Senior Management KERP with regard to Ms.
Georgakopoulos and does not intend to make any further payments to her. However,
the terms of her separation have yet to be negotiated.

          7.   Motion for Authority to Prohibit Trading of Equity Securities

          The Reorganizing Debtors filed this motion on the Petition Date,
requesting the Bankruptcy Court institute procedures to prohibit, without the
consent of the Reorganizing Debtors or the Bankruptcy Court, sales and other
transfers of equity securities of CNC by holders of the outstanding CNC common
stock on a fully diluted basis (a "Substantial Equityholder"), to prohibit,
without the consent of the Reorganizing Debtors or the Bankruptcy Court, the
acquisition of CNC equity securities by Substantial Equityholders or by persons
who would become a Substantial Equityholder as a result of that acquisition, and
to impose certain notification requirements on persons who are or become
Substantial Equityholders. The Reorganizing Debtors requested this relief in
order to guard against an unplanned change in control for purposes of section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could limit the Reorganizing Debtors'
ability to use net operating losses in the future. Such equity interest trading
could also adversely impact the Reorganizing Debtors by resulting in inadvertent
"changes in control" under state insurance regulations. The Bankruptcy Court
granted this motion and entered an amended final order on January 21, 2003.

          8.   Bar Date Order

          The Bankruptcy Court set a claims bar date of February 21, 2003 for
all creditors holding Claims against the Reorganizing Debtors. The Bankruptcy
Court also set June 17, 2003 as the bar date for governmental entities. If
creditors and governmental entities do not file any claims by the bar date, they
will be barred from asserting any claims against the Reorganizing Debtors or
receiving distributions under the Plan.

          On February 20, 2003, pursuant to the Debtors' emergency motion, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending the claims bar date for certain
listed D&O Credit Facility participants until the 60th day after the effective
date of any confirmed plan of reorganization for the Reorganizing Debtors.

          Also on February 20, 2003, pursuant to a joint motion of the CFC
Committee and Finance Company Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
extending the claims bar date for the Finance Company Debtors to file claims
against the Reorganizing Debtors to April 1, 2003.

          9.   Schedules and Statements

         The Reorganizing Debtors filed their respective schedules of assets and
liabilities and statement of financial affairs (the "Schedules") with the
Bankruptcy Court. The Schedules can be reviewed at the office

                                      -50-

of the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, 219 S. Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60604, or
can be obtained on the website www.bmccorp.net/conseco.

          10.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction Extending the Automatic Stay to
               Certain Directors and Officers

          Conseco, Inc. v. Carolyn Porter, et al. In this adversary action, CNC
is seeking an injunction barring plaintiffs in nine actions from pursuing claims
against certain current and former directors and officers of CNC, as well as its
non-debtor subsidiary, Conseco Services. On January 6, 2003, the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order staying all nine actions until April 6, 2003. The court
ruled that the automatic stay would not bar the plaintiffs in several of the
actions from perfecting the consolidation of those actions and selecting lead
counsel and a lead plaintiff. The action has been continued until the next
omnibus hearing after April 2, 2003. The stay in this action also has been
applied by stipulation to Roderick Russell, et al. v. Conseco, Inc., et al., an
adversary action involving claims against CNC, certain current and former
directors and officers of CNC, and Conseco Services.

          Conseco, Inc. v. Royal Insurance Company, et al. In this adversary
action, CNC is seeking a declaration that an action pending in Indiana state
court is subject to the automatic stay, as well as an injunction barring further
proceedings in that action. CNC's motion for a preliminary injunction was set
for hearing on January 6, 2003, but was carried over until January 14, 2003 at
11:00 a.m. On January 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the parties to
engage in additional briefing and suggested a ruling would be forthcoming. The
stay motion has since been carried over until March 19, 2003.

          11.  Estimation Procedures

          On February 19, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted an order
instituting procedures whereby claims against any Reorganizing Debtor may be
estimated. Estimation of disputed claims may be required in order to establish
appropriate reserves under the Plan.

          12.  Motion to Enforce the Automatic Stay, Demand the Turnover of
               Property, Settle Valid Lien Claims and Foreclose On, Sell, or
               Otherwise Transfer Property Free and Clear of All Liens

          On February 21, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered a second interim
order through the next omnibus hearing on March 20, 2003, (i) enforcing the
automatic stay in respect of lien claims on property securing loans owned,
originated or serviced by the Finance Company Debtors, (ii) authorizing the
Finance Company Debtors to demand the turnover of certain property of the
estates, (iii) authorizing the Debtors to settle valid lien claims and to
foreclose on, sell or otherwise transfer title to such property free and clear
of all liens. Pursuant to an agreed stipulation with Affordable Residential
Communities ("ARC"), the interim order will not apply to ARC. Additionally, ARC
and the Debtors agreed to work in good faith to resolve their differences. The
Debtors served the Lien Claimants with notice of the continued motion and the
Bankruptcy Court allowed time for the lien claimants to file objections to the
motion until on or before 5:00 p.m. CST, March 12, 2003.

          13.  Motion to Pay Certain Prepetition Claims and to Direct Financial
               Institutions to Honor and Process Checks and Transfers Relating
               to Such Claims

          As a result of the Debtors' acquisition of The Statesman Group, Inc.
in 1994 and its subsequent merger (the "Statesman Insurance Company
Acquisition"), CIHC became responsible for certain policies covering a
reinsurance agreement with Statesman Insurance Company. On February 21, 2003,
the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing CIHC to make payments on
certain of those claims and directing the relevant financial institutions to
process and pay any checks relating to those claims.

          On February 21, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted the CFC Committee's
retention of Huron Consulting Group LLC as Financial Advisors.

          15.  Motion to Enter Into Replacement Financing

          On February 26, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting
the Finance Company Debtors authority to pay the commitment fee with respect to
replacement debtor-in-possession financing with a syndicate of entities
affiliated with Goldman Sachs Credit Partners LP.

          16.  Debtors' Objections To Claims

          As of the date of this Disclosure Statement, the Debtors have filed
their First and Second Omnibus Objections to Claims, objecting to a total of 843
Claims in the aggregate amount of approximately $234,496,366. The Debtors
continue to review and analyze the approximately 9,000 filed and scheduled
claims that they have received in these Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors will
continue to raise appropriate objections and responses as necessary.

B.        APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES

          On January 3, 2003, the Office of the United States Trustee appointed
three official committees in the Chapter 11 Cases (collectively, the "Official
Committees"): (i) Official Committee of the Reorganizing Debtors (the "Conseco
Creditors Committee"); (ii) Official Committee of the Finance Company Debtors
(the "CFC Committee") and (iii) Official Committee of the Trust Preferred
Securities (the "TOPrS Committee").

          The members of the Conseco Creditors Committee are The Bank of New
York, Bank of America, N.A., Angelo, Gordon & Co., L.P., Appaloosa Mgmt., L.P.,
HSBC Bank USA, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC and First Pacific
Advisors, Inc. The Conseco Creditors Committee retained Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver & Jacobson and Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw as its legal advisors and have
filed an application to retain Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin LLP and Greenhill &
Co, LLC as its financial advisors.

          The members of the CFC Committee are U.S. Bank National Association,
Millenium Partners, L.P., Prudential Insurance Company, Commonwealth Advisors,
Inc., Deutsche Asset Management, Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Company and
Morgan Keegan. The CFC Committee retained Greenberg Traurig, P.C. as its legal
advisors and Huron Consulting Group LLC as its financial advisors.

          The members of the TOPrS Committee are Paul Floto, United Capital
Markets, Inc. and Oppenheimer Capital. The TOPrS Committee retained Saul Ewing
LLP and Jenner & Block as its legal advisors and Raymond James as its financial
advisors. The TOPrS Committee also retained Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. as its
insurance company valuation expert and Watson Wyatt Insurance & Financial
Services, Inc. as its actuarial consultant.

          Since the formation of the Official Committees, the Reorganizing
Debtors and Finance Company Debtors have consulted with the Official Committees
concerning the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors have kept the
Official Committees informed about their operations and have sought the
concurrence of the Official Committees to the extent their respective
constituencies would be affected by actions and transactions taken outside of
the ordinary course of their businesses. The Conseco Creditors Committee has
participated actively, together with the Reorganizing Debtors' and Finance
Company Debtors' management and professionals, in among other things, reviewing
their business plan and operations. The Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company
Debtors and their respective professionals have met with the Conseco Creditors
Committee and its professionals on numerous occasions in connection with the
negotiation of the Plan.

                                      VI.
                      SUMMARY OF THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

A.        OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 11

          Chapter 11 is the principal business reorganization chapter of the
Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is authorized
to reorganize its business for the benefit of itself, its creditors and interest
holders. Another goal of chapter 11 is to promote equality of treatment for
similarly situated creditors and similarly situated interest holders with
respect to the distribution of a debtor's assets.

          The commencement of a chapter 11 case creates an estate that is
comprised of all of the legal and equitable interests of the debtor as of the
filing date. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the debtor may continue to
operate its business and remain in possession of its property as a
"debtor-in-possession."

          The consummation of a plan of reorganization is the principal
objective of a chapter 11 case. A plan of reorganization sets forth the means
for satisfying claims against and interests in a debtor. Confirmation of a plan
of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court makes the plan binding upon the
debtor, any issuer of securities under the plan, any person or entity acquiring
property under the plan and any creditor of or equity holder in the debtor,
whether or not such creditor or equity holder (a) is impaired under or has
accepted the plan or (b) receives or retains any property under the plan.
Subject to certain limited exceptions and other than as provided in the plan
itself or the confirmation order, the confirmation order discharges the debtor
from any debt that arose prior to the date of confirmation of the plan and
substitutes therefor the obligations specified under the confirmed plan.

          A chapter 11 plan may specify that the legal, contractual and
equitable right of the holders of claim or interests in classes are to remain
unaltered by the reorganization effectuated by the plan. Such classes are
referred to as "unimpaired" and, because of such favorable treatment, are deemed
to accept the plan. Accordingly, it is not necessary to solicit votes from the
holders of claims or equity interests in such classes. A chapter 11 plan also
may specify that certain classes will not receive any distribution of property
or retain any claim against a debtor. Such classes are deemed not to accept the
plan and, therefore, need not be solicited to vote to accept or reject the plan.
Any classes that are receiving a distribution of property under the plan but are
not "unimpaired" will be solicited to vote to accept or reject the plan.

          Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan of
reorganization shall classify the claims of a debtor's creditors and equity
interest holders. In compliance therewith, the Plan divides Claims and Equity
Interests into various Classes and sets forth the treatment for each Class. The
Debtors also are required, as discussed above, under section 1122 of the
Bankruptcy Code, to classify Claims and Equity Interests into Classes that
contain Claims and Equity Interests that are substantially similar to the other
Claims and Equity Interests in such Classes. The Debtors believe that the Plan
has classified all Claims and Equity Interests in compliance with the provisions
of section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code, but it is possible that a Holder of a
Claim or Equity Interest may challenge the classification of Claims and Equity
Interests and that the Bankruptcy Court may find that a different classification
is required for the Plan to be confirmed. In such event, the Debtors intend, to
the extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Court and the Plan, to make such
reasonable modifications of the classifications under the Plan to permit
confirmation and to use the Plan acceptances received in this solicitation for
the purpose of obtaining the approval of the reconstituted Class or Classes of
which the accepting Holder is ultimately deemed to be a member. Any such
reclassification could adversely affect the Class in which such Holder was
initially a member, or any other Class under the Plan, by changing the
composition of such Class and the vote required of that Class for approval of
the Plan.

          The Debtors (and each of their respective Affiliates, agents,
directors, officers, employees, advisors and attorneys), the Unofficial
Noteholders' Committee, the Unofficial Lenders' Committee, and the Official
Committees, and each of the members of such committees (and each of their
respective Affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees, advisors, and
attorneys) have, and upon confirmation of the Plan will be deemed to have,
participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code with regard to the distributions of the securities under the
Plan, and

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

therefore are not, and on account of such distributions will not be, liable at
any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing
the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or such distributions
made pursuant to the Plan.

THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURE AND MEANS FOR
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND THE CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND
EQUITY INTERESTS UNDER THE PLAN, AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO THE PLAN (AS WELL AS THE EXHIBITS THERETO AND DEFINITIONS THEREIN)

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT INCLUDE SUMMARIES OF THE
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PLAN AND IN THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN. THE
STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO BE PRECISE
OR COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF ALL THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN OR DOCUMENTS
REFERRED THEREIN, AND REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE PLAN AND TO SUCH DOCUMENTS FOR
THE FULL AND COMPLETE STATEMENT OF SUCH TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN OR
DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN, AND REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE PLAN AND TO SUCH
DOCUMENTS FOR THE FULL AND COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF SUCH TERMS AND PROVISIONS.

THE PLAN ITSELF AND THE DOCUMENTS THEREIN CONTROL THE ACTUAL TREATMENT OF CLAIMS
AGAINST AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS UNDER THE PLAN AND WILL, UPON THE
OCCURRENCE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE, BE BINDING UPON ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AGAINST
AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS, THE DEBTORS' ESTATES, THE REORGANIZED
DEBTORS, ALL PARTIES RECEIVING PROPERTY UNDER THE PLAN, AND OTHER PARTIES IN
INTEREST. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, ON THE
ONE HAND, AND THE PLAN OR ANY OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
TERMS OF THE PLAN AND/OR SUCH OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT SHALL CONTROL.

B.        OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN

          There is a separate Subplan for each Debtor. The Subplans are
designated by the following letters:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>


------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
                        Debtor                                                Subplan
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
<S>         <C>                                                                  <C>

                    Conseco, Inc.                                                A
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
                  CIHC, Incorporated                                             B
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
                     CTIHC, Inc.                                                 C

------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

          The Debtors believe that the Plan provides the best and most prompt
possible recovery to Holders of Claims and Equity Interests. Under the Plan,
Claims against and Equity Interests in the Debtors are divided into different
classes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, claims and equity interests are classified
beyond mere "creditors" or "shareholders" because such entities may hold claims
or equity interests in more than one class. For purposes of this Disclosure
Statement, the term Holder refers to the holder of a Claim or Equity Interest in
a particular Class under the Plan. If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court and consummated, on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Debtors will make distributions in respect of certain Classes of
Claims and Equity Interests as provided in the Plan. The Classes of Claims
against and Equity Interests in the Debtors created under the Plan, the
treatment of those Classes under the Plan and distributions to be made under the
Plan are described below.

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

C.        SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION

          The estates of the Debtors have not been substantively consolidated.
The Claims held solely against one of the Debtors will be satisfied solely from
the cash and assets of such Debtor except as provided in the Plan. Except as
specifically set forth herein, nothing in the Plan or the Disclosure Statement
shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an admission that one of the Debtors
is subject to or liable for any Claim against any other Debtor. Except as
provided in the Plan, the Claims of Creditors that hold Claims against multiple
Debtors will be treated as separate Claims with respect to each Debtor's estate
for all purposes (including, but not limited to, distributions and voting), and
such Claims will be administered as provided in the Plan. Any Claims against the
Debtors will be satisfied according to the terms of the Plan.

D.        SEVERABILITY OF PLAN PROVISIONS

          The Plan is comprised of four Subplans of reorganization, one for each
Reorganizing Debtor. The confirmation requirements of section 1129 of the
Bankruptcy Code must be satisfied separately with respect to each Subplan. If
any Subplan(s) is not confirmed, then the Debtors reserve the right, with the
prior written consent of the Conseco Creditors Committee, to either (a) request
that the other Subplans be confirmed or (b) withdraw some or all Subplans;
provided that (i) the Subplan for CIHC may not be confirmed unless the Subplan
for CNC is confirmed and (ii) the Subplan for CNC may not be confirmed unless
the Subplan for CIHC is confirmed. Subject to the preceding provision, the
Debtors' inability to confirm or election to withdraw any Subplan(s) shall not
impair the confirmation of any other Subplan(s).

E.        CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS

          1.   Summary of Claims against all Debtors

               (a)  Administrative Claims

          Administrative Claims are Claims for costs and expenses of
administration of the Chapter 11 Cases that are entitled to priority pursuant to
section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Such Claims include (1) any actual and
necessary costs and expenses incurred after the Petition Date of preserving the
Debtors' estates and operating the businesses of the Debtors (such as wages,
salaries, commissions for services, leased equipment and premises), and Claims
of governmental units for taxes (including tax audit Claims related to tax years
commencing after the Petition Date, but excluding Claims relating to tax
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Petition Date) and (2) all
fees and charges assessed against the Debtors' Estates under Section 1930,
Chapter 123 of Title 28, United States Code.

          Subject to sections 328, 330(a) and 331 of the Bankruptcy Code, each
Holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim will be paid the full unpaid amount of
such Allowed Administrative Claim in Cash (i) on the Effective Date or as soon
thereafter as is practicable, (ii) or if such Administrative Claim is Allowed
after the Effective Date, on the date such Administrative Claim is Allowed, or
as soon thereafter as is practicable, or (iii) upon such other terms as may be
agreed upon by such Holder and the respective Reorganized Debtor or otherwise
upon an order of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that Allowed Administrative
Claims representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business or
otherwise assumed by the Debtors pursuant to the Plan will be assumed on the
Effective Date and paid or performed by the respective Reorganized Debtor when
due in accordance with the terms and conditions of the particular agreements
governing such obligations. The Reorganizing Debtors (and the Reorganized
Debtors) are not obliged to pay Administrative Claims against any Finance
Company Debtors.

               (b)  Priority Tax Claims

          Priority Tax Claims are Claims for taxes entitled to priority in
payment under sections 502(i) and 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code. On the
Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Holder of an Allowed
Priority Tax Claim due and payable on or prior to the Effective Date shall be
paid, at the option of the respective Debtor, (a) Cash in an amount equal to the
amount of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim, or (b) Cash over a six-year period
from the date of assessment as provided in section 1129(a)(9)(C)

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

of the Bankruptcy Code, with interest payable at a rate of 4% per annum or such
other rate as may be required by the Bankruptcy Code. The amount of any Priority
Tax Claim that is not an Allowed Claim or that is not otherwise due and payable
on or prior to the Effective Date, and the rights of the Holder of such Claim,
if any, to payment in respect thereof shall (x) be determined in the manner in
which the amount of such Claim and the rights of the Holder of such Claim would
have been resolved or adjudicated if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been
commenced, (y) survive the Effective Date and Consummation of the Plan as if the
Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced, and (z) not be discharged pursuant to
section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code. Reorganizing Debtors (and the Reorganized
Debtors) are not obliged to pay Priority Tax Claims Allowed against any Finance
Company Debtor.

          2.   Summary of the Claims and Equity Interests against the
               Reorganizing Debtors

          The categories of Claims and Equity Interests listed below classify
Claims and Equity Interests for all purposes, including voting, confirmation and
distribution pursuant hereto and pursuant to sections 1122 and 1123(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code. A Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed classified in a
particular Class only to the extent that the Claim or Equity Interest qualifies
within the description of that Class and shall be deemed classified in a
different Class to the extent that any remainder of such Claim or Equity
Interest qualifies within the description of such different Class. A Claim or
Equity Interest is in a particular Class only to the extent that such Claim or
Equity Interest is Allowed in that Class and has not been paid or otherwise
settled prior to the Effective Date. Any default with respect to any Allowed
Claim that existed immediately prior to the Petition Date shall be deemed cured
upon the Effective Date.

Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder

               (a)  CNC or the Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1A
                    Claim in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon
                    thereafter as is practicable; provided that, Class 1A Claims
                    representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
                    business will be paid in full in Cash when such Class 1A
                    Claims become due and owing in the ordinary course of
                    business; or

               (b)  Such Claim will be treated in any other manner so that such
                    Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired pursuant to
                    section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 1A is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, Holders of Class 1A Claims are not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii) Class 2A--Other Secured Claims (Unimpaired)

          Other CNC Secured Claims are Claims that are secured by a lien on
property in which CNC has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under
section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent of the value of the Claim
holder's interest in CNC's interest in such property, or to the extent of the
amount subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section
506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553
of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the
Holders of Class 2A Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to
by the Holder of the Allowed Class 2A Claim and CNC or a relevant Distribution
Agent, each Holder of an Allowed Class 2A Claim shall receive, in full and final
satisfaction of such Allowed Class 2A Claim, one of the following treatments, in
the sole discretion of CNC:

               (a)  the Allowed Class 2A Claims shall be reinstated as an
                    obligation of New CNC;

               (b)  CNC shall surrender all collateral securing such Claim to
                    the Holder thereof, without representation or warranty by or
                    further recourse against CNC or New CNC; provided that, such
                    surrender must render such Claim Unimpaired pursuant to
                    section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

               (c)  such Claim will be treated in any other manner so that such
                    Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired pursuant to
                    section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          Class 2A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2A are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iii) Class 3A--Reinstated Intercompany Claims (Unimpaired)

          Reinstated Intercompany Claims are those intercompany claims which,
from a regulatory perspective, cannot be cancelled or otherwise impaired under
the Plan. Reinstated Intercompany Claims also include all cure payments that may
arise as a result of the assumption of intercompany

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

executory contracts. A list of such Reinstated Intercompany Claims is attached
hereto as Exhibit G. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders
of Allowed Class 3A Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to
by the Holder of such Claim and CNC, each Allowed Class 3A Claim shall be
reinstated by New CNC in full and final satisfaction of such Class 3A Claim.

          Class 3A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 3A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The relevant agreements, instruments and documents underlying
Allowed Class 3A Claims will also be unimpaired. Therefore, the Holders of
Claims in Class 3A are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iv) Class 4A--93/94 Note Claims (Impaired)

          Class 4A consists of any Claim against CNC for principal or interest
under the 93/94 Notes. On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date,
each Holder of a Class 4A Claim will receive in respect of its Allowed Class 4A
Claim, in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class 4A Claims, a Pro
Rata share of the 93/94 Notes Distribution. The indebtedness represented by the
93/94 Notes is secured in part by a pledge of the stock of certain subsidiaries
of CFC. Accordingly, the Claims of the Holders of the 93/94 Notes may be
satisfied from proceeds received in connection with the CFC sale transaction. In
such event, these Holders will no longer have a right to receive a Pro Rata
share of the 93/94 Notes Distribution. CFC, however, may be entitled to a
distribution with respect to a reimbursement claim (if any) against CNC related
to its satisfaction of the Claims of such Holders to the extent that such claim
is not satisfied under Article VII.F of the Plan, in which case CFC's
reimbursement claim would be satisfied by the distribution of shares of New CNC
Common Stock as contemplated by the 93/94 Notes Distribution.

          Immediately prior to the Effective Date, but subject in all respects
to the immediate occurrence of the Effective Date, the Holders of Class 4A
Claims shall be deemed to release all prepetition liens on any assets of, and
all security interests they may have held in or against the Debtors or any of
the Debtors' Subsidiaries or their respective assets as of the Petition Date,
including, but not limited to their security interests in the CFC/CIHC
Intercompany Note.

          Class 4A is Impaired under the Plan. The Holders of Claims in Class 4A
are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (v)  Class 5A--Lender Claims (Impaired)

          Class 5A consists of two subclasses of the Lender Claims against CNC:
Lender Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O Credit Facility (Class 5A-1),
which are partially secured Claims, and all other Lender Claims (Class 5A-2).
The respective Class 5A Claims are Allowed for all purposes of the Chapter 11
Cases, without the need to File proofs of claim in the amount of the Allowed
Lender Claims, but due to the contractual subordination of certain other Allowed
Claims, distributions will be made on account of the Total Bank Debt Balance,
and such Allowed Class 5A Claims and the distributions under the Plan in respect
thereof shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any
respect.

          On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, (x) each Holder
of an Allowed Class 5A-1 Claim shall receive on account of its Allowed Class
5A-1 Claim and its related Allowed Class 4B-1 Claim, the treatment as set forth
for Class 4B-1 in Section III.C.4 of the Plan and (y) each Holder of an Allowed
Class 5A-2 Claim shall receive on account of its Allowed Class 5A-2 Claim and
its related Allowed Class 4B-2 Claim, the treatment as set forth for Class 4B-2
set forth below. Such treatments shall be in full and final satisfaction of all
Class 5A Claims. In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Date, but
subject in all respects to the immediate occurrence of the Effective Date, the
Holders of Class 5A Claims shall be deemed to release all prepetition liens on
and security interests in the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note. Classes 5A-1 and 5A-2
are Impaired Classes and Holders of Class 5A-1 and 5A-2 Claims are entitled to
vote separately to accept or reject the Plan.

               (vi) Class 6A--Exchange Notes Claims Against CNC (Impaired)

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

          Class 6A consists of the Exchange Notes Claims against CNC. The Class
6A Claims (along with Class 5B Claims) are Allowed for all purposes under the
Plan, without the need to file proofs of claim, in the aggregate amount of
$1,370,975,431.97, but to the extent the Holders of Exchange Note Claims are
entitled to postpetition interest under the Bankruptcy Code, distributions will
be made on account of the Total Exchange Note Claims. Allowed Class 6A Claims
and the distributions under the Plan in respect thereof shall not be subject to
offset, reduction or counterclaim in any respect. On or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class 6A Claim shall receive
in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class 6A Claims, in respect
of its Allowed Class 6A Claim and its related Allowed Class 5B Claim, the
treatment set forth for Class 5B in Article III.B.5 of the Plan.

               (vii) Class 7A--Original Note Claims (Impaired)

          Class 7A consists of Original Note Claims against CNC. The Class 7A
Claims are Allowed for all purposes under the Plan, without the need to file
Proofs of Claim, in the amounts as set forth in the Plan Supplement, and such
Allowed Class 7A Claims and the distributions under the Plan in respect thereof
shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any respect. On or
as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class
7A Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class
7A Claims, its Pro Rata share of the Original Note Distribution. In addition,
Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin LLP and any other professionals of the Unofficial
Noteholders Committee will be paid in full on the Effective Date their unpaid
fees and expenses (whether incurred prior to or after the Petition Date) in
accordance with their prepetition engagement letters. Class 7A is Impaired and
Holders of Class 7A Claims are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

             (viii) Class 8A--Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
                    (Impaired)

          Class 8A consists of the Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
against CNC. On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder
of an Allowed Class 8A Claim will receive, in full and final satisfaction of all
such Allowed Class 8A Claims, its Pro Rata share of the CNC Unsecured
Distribution. Class 8A is Impaired and Holders of Class 8A Claims are entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ix) Class 9A--Convenience Class Claims (Unimpaired)

          Class 9A consists of the Convenience Class Claims against CNC. CNC
will treat such Allowed Class 9A Claims in a manner that will render such Claims
Unimpaired by the Bankruptcy Code. Each holder of an Allowed Class 8A Claim may
elect to be treated as a Holder of an Allowed Class 9A Convenience Class Claim.
Any such election must be made on the Ballot, and no Creditor can elect Class 9A
Claim treatment after the Voting Deadline. Each Holder of an allowed Class 9A
Claim shall receive the lesser of (a) $500 or (b) the amount of their Allowed
Class 8A Claim. Any Allowed Class 8A Claim that exceeds $500, but whose Holder
elects to be treated as a Class 9A Claim shall be automatically reduced in
complete satisfaction of such Class 8A Claim to the amount of distribution made
on account of such Convenience Class Claim. Class 9A is Unimpaired and the
Holders of Class 9A Claims are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.

               (x)  Class 10A--Trust Related Claims (Impaired)

          Class 10A consists of the Trust Related Claims. Trust Related Claims
are contractually subordinated to Exchange Note Claims and Original Note Claims.
Accordingly, the recoveries that the Trust Related Claims may have been entitled
to, but for the contractual subordination provisions to which they are subject,
will be distributed to the Holders of Exchange Note Claims and Original Note
Claims. If Class 10A accepts the Plan, on or as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class 10A Claim shall receive, along
with the Holders of Allowed Class 11A-1 Interests (if Class 11A-1 also accepts
the Plan), in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Trust Related
Claims, its Pro-Rata share of the Junior Recovery.

          Restriction on recovery: The Junior Recovery being offered to Class
10A is subject to contractual subordination between the Holders of Trust Related
Claims, on the one hand, and the Lender Claims and

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

the Senior Notes Claims, on the other hand, and is being provided by the Holders
of the Lender Claims and the Senior Notes in order to facilitate a consensual
Plan. The Junior Recovery is being provided with the consent of the Holders of
the Lender Claims and the Senior Notes Claims. If Class 10A rejects the Plan,
Holders of Class 10A and 11A-1 Claims or Interests will not receive a
distribution under the Plan, and the distributions that are reserved for Class
10A under this paragraph shall instead be distributed to the Holders of Senior
Note Claims. The Debtors reserve the right (i) to request that the Bankruptcy
Court confirm the Plan in accordance with section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
and/or (ii) to modify the Plan in accordance with the terms hereof.

          Class 10A is Impaired and Holders of Class 10A Claims are entitled to
vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (xi)    Class 11A--Old CNC Preferred Stock Interests (Impaired)

          Class 11A consists of the two subclasses of Old CNC Preferred Stock
Interests: Old CNC Series F Preferred Stock Interests (Class 11A-1) and Old CNC
Other Preferred Stock Interests (Class 11A-2). The Old CNC Other Preferred Stock
Interests are contractually subordinated to the Old CNC Series F Preferred Stock
Interests. If Class 10A and Class 11A-1 accept the Plan, on or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class 11A-1
Interest shall receive, along with the Holders of Allowed Class 10A Claims, in
full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Interests, its Pro-Rata share of
the Junior Recovery. In any event, Holders of Allowed Class 11A-2 Interests will
not receive a distribution under the Plan in respect of such Interests. On the
Effective Date, Class 11A-1 Interests and Class 11A-2 Interests will be
cancelled.

          Restriction on recovery: If Class 11A-1 rejects the Plan, Holders of
Class 11A-1 Interests will not receive a distribution under the Plan, and the
distributions that are reserved for Class 11A-1 under this paragraph shall be
retained in the Junior Recovery and be added to the distribution made available
to the Holders of Allowed Class 10A Claims. If both Class 11A-1 and 10A reject
the plan, the entire Junior Recovery will be distributed to the Holders of
Senior Note Claims. The Debtors reserve the right (i) to request that the
Bankruptcy Court confirm the Plan in accordance with section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code and/or (ii) to modify the Plan in accordance with the terms
hereof.

          Class 11A-1 is Impaired and Holders of Class 11A-1 Interests are
entitled to separately vote to accept or reject the Plan, while Holders of Class
11A-2 Interests are conclusively deemed to reject the Plan and are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (xii)   Class 12A--Old CNC Common Stock Interests (Impaired)

          Class 12A consists of the Allowed Old CNC Common Stock Interests. On
the Effective Date, Class 12A Interests will be cancelled and Holders thereof
will not receive a distribution under the Plan in respect of such Interests.

          Class 12A is Impaired and is conclusively deemed to reject the Plan.
Holders of Class 12A Old CNC Common Stock Interests are not entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan.

               (xiii)  Class 13A--Discharged Intercompany Claims (Impaired)

          Class 13A consists of Discharged Intercompany Claims against CNC. A
list of such Discharged Intercompany Claims is attached hereto as Exhibit F.
Class 13A Claims will be cancelled and Holders thereof will not receive a
distribution under the Plan in respect of such Claims. Class 13A is Impaired and
is conclusively deemed to reject the Plan under section 1126(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, Holders of Class 13A Claims are not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan.

               (xiv)   Class 14A--Securities Claims (Impaired)

          Class 14A consists of Securities Claims against CNC. Class 14A Claims
will be cancelled and Holders thereof will not receive a distribution under the
Plan. Class 14A is Impaired and is conclusively

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

deemed to reject the Plan under section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Therefore, Holders of Class 14A Claims are not entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan.

</TABLE>

               (i)     Class 1B--Other Priority Claims (Unimpaired)

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual
rights of the Holders of Allowed Class 1B Claims are unaltered by the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and
CIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class 1B Claim shall receive, in full and final
satisfaction of such Allowed Class 1B Claim, one of the following treatments, in
the sole discretion of CIHC:

               (a)     Reorganized CIHC or the Distribution Agent will pay the
                       Allowed Class 1B Claim in full in Cash on the Effective
                       Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable; provided
                       that, Class 1B Claims representing obligations incurred
                       in the ordinary course of business will be paid in full
                       in Cash when such Claim becomes due and owing in the
                       ordinary course of business; or

               (b)     such Claim will be treated in any other manner so that
                       such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                       pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

          Class 1B is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1B Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, Holders of Class 1B Claims are not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii)    Class 2B--Secured Claims (Unimpaired)

          Other Secured Claims are Claims that are secured by a lien on property
in which CIHC has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under section 553 of
the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent of the value of the Claim holder's interest
in CIHC's interest in such property, or to the extent of the amount subject to
setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section 506(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of
Class 2B Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of the Allowed Class 2B Claim and CIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class
2B Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed Class 2B
Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CIHC:

               (a)     the Allowed Class 2B Claims shall be reinstated as an
                       obligation of Reorganized CIHC;

               (b)     CIHC or the Distribution Agent shall surrender all
                       collateral securing such Claim to the Holder thereof,
                       without representation or warranty by or further recourse
                       against CIHC, Reorganized CIHC or such Distribution
                       Agent, provided that, such surrender must render such
                       Claim Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the
                       Bankruptcy Code; or

                (c)    such Claim will be treated in any other manner so that
                       such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                       pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 2A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2B Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2A are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iii)   Class 3B--Reinstated Intercompany Claims (Unimpaired)

          Reinstated Intercompany Claims are those intercompany claims which,
from a regulatory perspective, cannot be cancelled or otherwise impaired under
the Plan. A list of such Reinstated Intercompany Claims is attached hereto as
Exhibit G. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of Allowed
Class 3B Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of such Claim and CIHC, each Allowed Class 3B Claim shall be reinstated
by Reorganized CIHC in full and final satisfaction of such Class 3B Claim. Class
3B is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 3B Claims are conclusively deemed to
have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 3B are not entitled to vote to accept
or reject the Plan.

               (iv)    Class 4B--Lender Claims (Impaired)

          Class 4B consists of two subclasses of the Lender Claims against CIHC:
Lender Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O Credit Facility (Class 4B-1),
which are partially secured Claims, and all other Lender Claims (Class 4B-2).
The Class 4B Claims are Allowed for all purposes of the Chapter 11 Cases,
without the need to File proofs of claims, in the amount of the Allowed Lender
Claims, but due to the contractual subordination of certain other Allowed
Claims, distributions will be made on account of the Total Bank Debt Balance,
and such Allowed Class 4B Claims and the distributions in the Plan in respect of
Class 4B Claims shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any
respect.

          Treatment: On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each
Holder of an Allowed Class 4B Claim shall receive on account of and in full and
final satisfaction of its Allowed Class 4B Claim and its related Allowed Class
5A Claim, its Pro Rata share of the: (i) New Tranche A Bank Debt ; (ii) New

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

Tranche B Bank Debt; (iii) New CNC Preferred Stock; and (iv) New CNC Warrants.
CIHC will guaranty the New Tranche A Bank Debt and the New Tranche B Bank Debt
and the obligations in respect thereof will be secured as contemplated by the
New Credit Facility. Such treatment shall be in full and final satisfaction of
all Class 4B Claims and Class 5A Claims, and of any rights to contractual
subordination of other Allowed Claims for the benefit of Class 4B Claims and
Class 5A Claims. In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Date, but
subject in all respects to the immediate occurrence of the Effective Date, the
Holders of Class 4B Claims and Class 5A Claims shall be deemed to release all
prepetition liens on and security interests in the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note.
In addition, the Lenders' Agents and each of the Lenders shall receive in Cash
on the Effective Date an amount equal to all of its fees, expenses and other
amounts (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of counsel and
financial advisors including, without limitation, Greenhill & Co., LLC) payable
in connection with the Senior Credit Facility or the D&O Credit Facilities, as
the case may be, including, without limitation, in connection with the Chapter
11 Cases, the Plan, the implementation of the Plan or any documentation relating
thereto. The New Tranche A Bank Debt and New Tranche B Bank Debt shall be issued
in separate tranches as follows: (i) to Holders of Claims under the Senior
Credit Facility, (ii) to Holders of Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O
Credit Facility and (iii) to Holders of Claims under or derived from the other
D&O Credit Facilities. The Lenders under the respective D&O Credit Facilities
shall be deemed to have transferred to New CNC, pursuant to the terms of the D&O
Transfer Agreement to be executed on the Effective Date, all loans made to the
individual borrowers under the D&O Credit Facilities as a result of satisfaction
of the Guarantees of D&O Credit Facilities and all rights and remedies in
respect thereof to New CNC, and all amounts paid by such borrowers shall be
applied to the loans under the New Credit Facility as set forth in the New
Credit Facility.

          Classes 4B-1 and 4B-2 are Impaired Classes and Holders of Class 4B-1
and 4B-2 Claims are entitled to vote separately to accept or reject the Plan.

               (v)     Class 5B--Exchange Notes Claims (Impaired)

          Class 5B consists of Exchange Note Claims against CIHC.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Class
5B Claims (along with Class 6A Claims) shall be deemed Allowed Claims for all
purposes under the Chapter 11 Cases, without the need to File proofs of claim,
in full and final satisfaction of any Claims against the Debtors, in the
aggregate amount of $1,370,975,431.97, but to the extent the Holders of Exchange
Note Claims are entitled to postpetition interest under the Bankruptcy Code,
distributions will be made on account of the Total Exchange Note Claims. The
TOPrS Committee maintains that Holders of Exchange Note Claims are not entitled
to postpetition interest under the Bankruptcy Code. Holders of Allowed Class 5B
Claims will receive in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class 6A
and Class 5B Claims a Pro Rata share of (i) the Exchange Note Distribution, on
or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, and (ii) any Available
Proceeds, when and if such proceeds are available for distribution, as
determined by the Residual Trustee. For a discussion of the relevant
subordination provisions, see the Summary at page 2 of this Disclosure
Statement. In addition, Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin LLP and any other
professionals of the Unofficial Noteholders Committee will be paid on the
Effective Date the unpaid fees and expenses (whether incurred prior to or after
the Petition Date) in accordance with their prepetition engagement letters.
Class 5B is Impaired and is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (vi)    Class 6B--Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
                       (Impaired)

          Under the Plan, Class 6B consists of any Reorganizing Debtor Unsecured
Claim against CIHC, including the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note. On the Effective
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Holder of an Allowed Class 6B
Claim will receive in full and final satisfaction of such Class 6B Claims, its
Pro Rata share of the CIHC Unsecured Distribution. Because Class 6B claims are
not contractually subordinated to Lender Claims, the CIHC Unsecured Distribution
is not reduced by virtue of postpetition interest being included in the Total
Bank Debt Balance. Class 6B is Impaired and is entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan.

               (vii)   Class 7B--Convenience Class Claims (Impaired)

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

          Class 7B consists of the Convenience Class Claims against CIHC. CIHC
will treat such Allowed 7B Claims in a manner that will render such Claims
Unimpaired under the Bankruptcy Code. Each Holder of an Allowed Class 6B General
Unsecured Claim may elect to be treated as a Holder of an Allowed Class 7B
Convenience Class Claim. Any such election must be made on the Ballot, and no
Creditor can elect Class 7B Claim treatment after the Voting Deadline. Each
Holder of an Allowed Class 7B Claim shall receive the lesser of (a) $500 or (b)
the amount of their Allowed Class 6B Claim. Any Allowed Class 6B Claim that
exceeds $500 but whose Holder elects to be treated as a Class 7B Claim shall be
automatically reduced in complete satisfaction of such Class 6B Claim to the
amount of distribution made on account of such Convenience Class Claim. Class 7B
is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 7B Claims are conclusively presumed to
have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.

               (viii)  Class 8B--Reinstated CIHC Preferred Stock Interests
                       (Unimpaired)

          Class 8B consists of Interests relating to the Reinstated CIHC
Preferred Stock Interests. Reorganized CIHC will reinstate the Allowed
Reinstated CIHC Preferred Stock Interests. Class 8B is Unimpaired and the
Holders of Class 8B Interests are conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of
Interests in Class 8B are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ix)    Class 9B--Old CIHC Common Stock Interests (Unimpaired)

          Class 9B consists of Interests relating to the Old CIHC Common Stock.
Reorganized CIHC will reinstate the Allowed Old CIHC Common Stock Interests.
Class 9B is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 9B Interests are conclusively
deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Therefore, the Holders of Class 9B Interests are not entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan.

               (x)     Class 10B--Discharged Intercompany Claims (Impaired)

          Class 10B consists of the Discharged Intercompany Claims against CIHC.
A list of such Discharged Intercompany Claims is attached hereto as Exhibit F.
Class 10B Claims will not receive a distribution under the Plan. Class 10B is
Impaired and is deemed to reject the Plan under 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Class 10B is not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (xi)    Class 11B--Securities Claims (Impaired)

          Class 11B consists of any Claims, obligations, rights, suits, damages,
causes of action, remedies and liabilities, whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, currently existing or hereafter arising, in law
or equity or otherwise arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a
security of CIHC for damages arising from the purchase, sale or holding of such
securities, or for reimbursement, indemnification (except as set forth in
Article VI.D of the Plan) or contribution allowed under section 502 of the
Bankruptcy Code on account of such a Claim. Class 11B will not receive a
distribution under the Plan. Class 11B is conclusively deemed to reject the
Plan. Holders of Class 11B Claims will not be entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan.

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual
rights of the Holders of Allowed Class 1C Claims are unaltered by the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and
CTIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class 1C Claim shall receive, in full and final
satisfaction of such Allowed Class 1C Claim, one of the following treatments, in
the sole discretion of CTIHC:

               (a)     The Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1C
                       Claim in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon
                       thereafter as is practicable, provided that, Class 1C
                       Claims representing obligations incurred in the ordinary
                       course of business will be paid in full in Cash when such
                       Class 1C Claims become due and owing in the ordinary
                       course of business;

               (b)     such Claim will be treated in any other manner so that
                       such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                       pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 1C is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1C Claims are

interest in CTIHC's interest in such property, or to the extent of the amount
subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section 506(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of

Holder of the Allowed Class 2C Claim and CTIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class
2C Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed Class 2C
Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CTIHC:

                       by or recourse against CTIHC or Reorganized CTIHC,
                       provided that, such surrender must render such Claim
                       Unimpaired pursuant to Section 1124 of the Bankruptcy
                       Code; or

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to

          Class 2D is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2D Claims are

                                      -67-

          On the Effective Date, Old CNC shall issue the Residual Share to the

          The Debtors (and each of their respective Affiliates, agents,

Noteholders' Committee, the Unofficial Lenders' Committee, and the Official
Committees, and each of the members of such committees (and each of their

participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code with regard to the distributions of the securities under the

liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation
governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or such

          4.   Creation of Residual Trust

          On the Effective Date, the Residual Trust shall be settled and exist

          5.   Implementation of Senior Management KERP

<PAGE>

obligations thereunder, including the payment of performance bonuses, emergence

          6.   Assumption of the Senior Management Employment Agreements

          To the extent the Debtors have not already assumed the Senior
Management Employment Agreements prior to the Effective Date (to the extent such
agreements apply to the Debtors), on the Effective Date the Debtors shall be
deemed to have assumed the Senior Management Employment Agreements, and to the
extent such agreements apply to affiliated non-debtors, they shall be affirmed
and restated in all respects by the Debtors and the applicable affiliated
non-debtors on the Effective Date.

          7.   Creation of Professional Escrow Account

         On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall establish the

          9.   Corporate Governance, Directors and Officers, and Corporate
               Action

               (a)     Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws

          On or before the Effective Date, New CNC will file the Restated CNC
Charter with the Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance with Section 103
of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Restated CNC Charter will, among
other things, authorize a yet-to-be-determined number of shares of New CNC
Common Stock and a yet-to-be-determined number of shares of New CNC Preferred
Stock. In addition, the Restated CNC Charter shall prohibit the issuance of
non-voting equity securities to the extent required by the provisions of Section
1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. After the Effective Date, New CNC may amend
and restate the Restated CNC Charter and other constituent documents as
permitted by Delaware law.

               (b)     Directors and Officers of the Reorganized Debtors

          The board of directors of New CNC will consist of seven members,
including two members from senior management and five outside members selected
by the Conseco Creditors Committee. The Restated CNC Charter will provide that
the board of directors of New CNC shall be divided into two classes of
directors, with the initial Class I directors serving for a term expiring at the
next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Date and
the initial Class II directors serving for a term expiring at the second
succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective Date. Other
than the term for the initial Class II directors, the term of each class of
directors shall expire at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.

          The board of directors of New CNC will appoint the board of directors
of Reorganized CIHC. In accordance with section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors will file and serve a notice setting forth the officers and
Directors of the Debtors no later than ten (10) calendar days before the
Confirmation Date, and will specify the Class for directors of New CNC. The
Debtors will serve the notice upon: (i) the US Trustee, (ii) the Core Group (as
defined in the then current Case Management Procedures approved by the
Bankruptcy Court), and (iii) parties who have requested notice pursuant to Rule
2002 of the Bankruptcy Rules. Notice will be served in the manner set forth in
the then current Case Management Procedures.

               (c)     Conseco, Inc. 2003 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan

                                      -69-
<PAGE>


          On the Effective Date, New CNC will implement the Conseco, Inc. 2003
Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan. The equity incentive plan provides, among other
things, for grants of stock options and restricted stock awards. Directors,
officers and other employees of New CNC and its subsidiaries and persons who
provide services to New CNC or its subsidiaries are eligible for grants under
the plan. The purpose of the equity incentive plan is to provide these
individuals with incentives to maximize stockholder value and otherwise
contribute to the success of New CNC and to attract, retain and reward the best
available persons for positions of responsibility. Up to 10% of the equity of
New CNC will be available for issuance under the equity incentive plan. The
equity incentive plan and a summary term sheet of the plan will be filed with
the Bankruptcy Court as soon as practicable.

               (d)     Employment Agreements

          On the Effective Date, New CNC shall enter into the Senior Management
Employment Agreements.

               (e)     Listing/Registration Rights

          On the Effective Date, New CNC shall (i) be a reporting company under
the Exchange Act, (ii) cause the shares of New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC
Common Stock and New CNC Warrants to be listed on the NYSE or such other
securities exchange as agreed with the Conseco Creditors Committee, if the
listing requirements for such securities exchange are satisfied with respect to
such securities, and (iii) execute and deliver a Registration Rights Agreement
substantially in the form set forth in the Plan Supplement.

               (f)     Corporate Action

          On the Effective Date, the adoption and filing of the Restated CNC
Charter, the approval of the Restated CNC By-laws, the appointment of directors
and officers for the Reorganized Debtors, the adoption of the equity incentive
plan, and all actions contemplated hereby shall be authorized and approved in
all respects (subject to the provisions hereof) pursuant to the Plan. All
matters provided for in the Plan required by the Debtors or Reorganizing Debtors
in connection with the Plan, shall be deemed to have occurred and shall be in
effect, without any requirement of further action by the security holders or
directors of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors. On the Effective Date, the
appropriate officers of the Reorganized Debtors and members of the board of
directors of the Reorganized Debtors are authorized and directed to issue,
execute and deliver the agreements, documents, securities and instruments
contemplated by the Plan in the name of and on behalf of the Reorganized Debtors
without the need for any required approvals, authorizations or consents except
for express consents required under the Plan.

          10.  Sources of Cash for Plan Distribution

          All Cash necessary for the Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized
Debtors to make payments pursuant hereto shall be obtained from existing Cash
balances of the Debtors.

          11.  Retiree Benefits

          The Reorganizing Debtors shall timely pay any retiree benefits as
defined in section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that such

include those that arise from the plans, funds or programs described in the Plan
Supplement.

          12.  GM Building Sale

          The sale or transfer of the GM Building (or entities owning the GM
Building or interests therein) pursuant to or consistent with an Order of the
Bankruptcy Court shall be deemed a transfer under, pursuant to and in
furtherance of the Plan.

G.        TREATMENT OF LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; RESOLUTION OF D&O
          STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM

          The Debtors are involved on an ongoing basis in lawsuits (including
purported class actions) relating to their operations, including with respect to
sales practices, and certain of their current and former officers and directors
are defendants in pending class action lawsuits asserting claims under the
securities laws and derivative lawsuits. The ultimate outcome of these lawsuits
cannot be predicted with certainty.

          1.   Securities Litigation

          As disclosed in CNC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2002, CNC has settled certain securities litigation for $120
million. Of this amount, $95 million was paid by CNC's director and officer
insurers. Certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's") have refused to
pay the remaining $25 million. CNC is currently litigating coverage with Lloyd's
in Indiana state court. In that action, Royal Insurance Company of America has
asserted counterclaims seeking repayment of $15 million it previously provided
to CNC as part of the settlement. Thus, if CNC does not prevail in this
litigation, it could face a judgment requiring it to pay up to an additional $40
million in connection with the settlement. CNC has asked the Bankruptcy Court to
stay the Indiana state court action, and the Bankruptcy Court is scheduled to
hear that motion on March 20, 2003. These Claims are classified as Class 14A
Securities Claims pursuant to section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          Since our August 9, 2002 announcement, a total of eight purported
securities fraud class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaints name CNC as
a defendant, along with certain current and former officers of CNC. These
lawsuits were filed on behalf of persons or entities who purchased CNC's common
stock on various dates between October 24, 2001 and August 9, 2002. Plaintiffs
in one of these lawsuits have filed an uncontested consolidation and lead
plaintiff motion, which, if granted, would result in the consolidation of these
eight cases into one. These Claims are classified as Class 14A and 11B
Securities Claims under the Plan. CNC believes that these lawsuits are
meritless. Additionally, CNC has filed an adversary proceeding to extend the
automatic stay provided for by the Bankruptcy Code to this litigation as it
pertains to current and former officers and directors of CNC.

          In October 2002, Roderick Russell, on behalf of himself and a class of
persons similarly situated, and on behalf of the ConsecoSavePlan, filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
against CNC, Conseco Services and certain current and former officers of CNC
(Roderick Russell, et al. v Conseco, Inc., et al., Case No. I :02-CV -1639 LJM).
The purported class action consists of all individuals whose 401(k) accounts
held common stock of CNC at any time from April 28, 1999 through the present.
The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty. These
claims are classified as 14A and 11B Securities Claims under the Plan. CNC
believes that this lawsuit is meritless. Additionally, CNC has filed an
adversary proceeding to extend the automatic stay provided for by the Bankruptcy
Code to this litigation as it pertains to current and former officers and
directors of CNC.

          2.   Derivative Litigation

          Nine shareholder derivative suits were filed in 2000 in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaints named
the current directors, certain former directors, certain non-director officers
of CNC (in one case), and alleging aiding and abetting liability, certain banks
that allegedly made loans in relation to CNC's "Stock Purchase Plan" (in three
cases). CNC is also named as a nominal defendant in each complaint. These cases
have now been consolidated into one case in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana, captioned: "In Re Conseco, Inc. Derivative
Litigation", Case Number IP00655-C-Y/S. Two similar cases have been filed in the
Hamilton County Superior Court in Indiana. The cases filed in Hamilton County
have been stayed pending resolution of the derivative suits filed in the United
States District Court. CNC asserts that these lawsuits are assets of the estate
pursuant to section 541(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and does not currently intend
to pursue them postpetition because they are meritless. The maximum exposure to
the Company for these lawsuits is unknown. A list of prepetition derivative
lawsuits is attached as Exhibit I hereto.

                                      -71-

          3.   Other Litigation

          On January 15, 2002, Carmel Fifth, LLC ("Carmel"), an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of CNC, exercised its rights to require 767 Manager, LLC
("Manager"), an affiliate of Donald J. Trump, to elect within 60 days, either to
acquire Carmel's interests in 767 LLC for $499.4 million, or to sell its
interests in 767 LLC to Carmel for $15.6 million (the "Buy/Sell Right"). Such
rights were exercised pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of 767
LLC. 767 LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that indirectly owns the
General Motors Building, a 50-story office building in New York, New York (the
"GM Building"). 767 LLC is owned by Carmel and Manager. On February 6, 2002, Mr.
Trump commenced a civil action against CNC, Carmel and 767 LLC in New York State
Supreme Court, entitled Donald J. Trump v. Conseco, Inc., et al. (the "State
Court Action"). Plaintiff claims that CNC and Carmel breached an agreement,
dated July 3, 2001, to sell Carmel's interests in 767 LLC to plaintiff for $295
million on or before September 15, 2001 (the "July 3rd Agreement").
Specifically, plaintiff claims that CNC and Carmel improperly refused to accept
a reasonable guaranty of plaintiff's payment obligations, refused to complete
the sale of Carmel's interest before the September 15, 2001 deadline, repudiated
an oral promise to extend the September 15 deadline indefinitely and repudiated
the July 3rd Agreement by exercising Carmel's Buy/Sell Right. Plaintiff asserts
claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary
duty. Plaintiff is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of approximately $1
billion and declaratory and injunctive relief blocking Carmel's Buy/Sell Right.
On March 25, 2002, Carmel filed a Demand for Arbitration and Petition and
Statement of Claim with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to have the
issues relating to the Buy/Sell Right resolved by arbitration (the
"Arbitration"). Manager and Mr. Trump requested the New York State Supreme Court
to stay that arbitration, but the Court denied Manager's and Trump's request on
May 2, 2002, allowing the arbitration to proceed. Mr. Trump and Manager appealed
that decision to the New York Appellate Division. In addition, CNC and Carmel
filed a Motion to Dismiss Mr. Trump's lawsuit on March 25, 2002. By Stipulation
and Order, dated June 14, 2002, the State Court Action was stayed, pending
resolution of the Arbitration. CNC plans to vigorously pursue its options to
compel prompt resolution of this dispute. CNC believes that Mr. Trump's lawsuit
is without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its own rights to acquire the
GM Building. The ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. On
February 21, 2003, the Trump entities filed a proof of claim asserting a general
unsecured claim of $1 billion against CNC. On March 3, 2003, CNC and Carmel
Fifth initiated an adversary proceeding against the Trump entities. CNC and
Carmel Fifth's adversary complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief
against the Trump entities. CNC and Carmel Fifth's adversary action requests
that the court find (1) that the July 3rd Agreement terminated due to Trump's
failure to comply with the terms of that agreement, and (2) that the Trump
entities are required to convey their interest in 767 LLC to Carmel Fifth
pursuant to Carmel Fifth's rights under the LLC Agreement. On March 5, 2003, CNC
and Carmel Fifth, in the adversary proceeding, filed an emergency motion for
preliminary injunction and an emergency motion for expedited hearing. Through
those motions, CNC and Carmel Fifth seek: an accelerated schedule for resolution
of their claims against the Trump entities, removal of Mr. Trump from management
of the GM Building, and an order restraining Mr. Trump and the Trump entities
from interference with CNC and Carmel Fifth's efforts to market the GM Building.
If the Trump entities ultimately hold an Allowed Claim against CNC, such Claim
is classified as a Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claim against
CNC.

          On June 24, 2002, the heirs of a former officer, Lawrence Inlow,
commenced an action against CNC, Conseco Services and two former officers in the
Boone Circuit Court (Inlow et al. v. Conseco, Inc., et al., Cause No.
06C01-0206-CT-244). The heirs assert that unvested options to purchase 756,248
shares of CNC common stock should have been vested at Mr. Inlow's death. The
heirs further claim that if such options had been vested, they would have been
exercised, and that the resulting shares of common stock would have been sold
for a gain of approximately $30 million based upon a stock price of $58.125 per
share, the highest stock price during the alleged exercise period of the
options. CNC believes the heirs' claims are without merit and will defend the
action vigorously. The maximum exposure to the Company for this lawsuit is
estimated to be $33 million. The ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with
certainty. Under the Plan, claims relating to this lawsuit, if allowed, will be
treated as Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims, although the
Debtors reserve their right to seek to subordinate this claim under section
510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                                      -72-
<PAGE>


          CNC is also a party to litigation related to the death of Lawrence
Inlow with the manufacturer of the corporate helicopter and other parties. This
litigation was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Indiana (In re: Inlow Accident Litigation, Cause No.
IP99-0830-C-H/G) and is currently on appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals. The maximum exposure for this litigation is estimated to be $25
million, although CNC believes that the claims against it are without merit. The
ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. Under the Plan claims
relating to this lawsuit, if allowed, will be treated as Class 8A Reorganizing
Debtor General Unsecured and Claims. CNC is also party to litigation with
Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. in Hamilton County Superior Court
(Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Conseco Inc., et al, Cause No.
29C01-9909-CP588) relating to Associated Aviation Underwriters' obligation to
defend and/or indemnify CNC in the aforementioned litigation. If CNC prevails in
this lawsuit, Associated Underwriters may be obligated to indemnify the CNC for
all or part of its liability in the aforementioned litigation. This litigation
has been stayed until final judgments are rendered in the former litigation.

          In addition, CNC and its subsidiaries are involved on an ongoing basis
in other lawsuits and arbitrations (including purported class actions) related
to their operations. These actions include one action brought by the Texas
Attorney General regarding long term care policies, two purported nationwide
class actions involving claims related to "vanishing premiums," two purported
nationwide class actions involving claims related to "modal premiums" (the
alleged imposition and collection of insurance premium surcharges in excess of
stated annual premiums). The ultimate outcome of all of these other legal
matters pending against CNC or its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, and,
although such lawsuits are not expected individually to have a material adverse
effect on CNC, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on CNC's consolidated financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. The maximum aggregate exposure for such lawsuits is estimated to be
approximately $22 million. Under the Plan, claims relating to these lawsuits, if
allowed, will be treated as Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims.

          4.   Other Proceedings

          CNC has been notified that the staff of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission has obtained a formal order of investigation in connection
with an inquiry that relates to events in and before the spring of 2000,
including CNC's accounting for its interest-only securities and servicing
rights. These issues were among those addressed in CNC's write-down and
restatement in the spring of 2000, and were the subject of shareholder class
action litigation, which has recently been settled as described above. CNC is
cooperating with the SEC staff in this matter.

          CNC has been notified that the Alabama Securities Commission is
examining CNC's 1998 Directors/Officers & Key Employees Stock Purchase Program
and the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Program Work-Down Plan. CNC is cooperating
with the Commissioner's staff in this matter.

          5.   Resolution of Directors & Officers Stock Purchase Program

          Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, New CNC and
Reorganized CIHC shall take the following actions with respect to the
individuals and entities (each a "Participant" and collectively, the
"Participants") that (i) owe amounts under the D&O Credit Facilities or to New
CNC and Reorganized CIHC pursuant to the various Directors & Officers Stock
Purchase Programs (the "Stock Programs") and (ii) purchased 40,000 or less
shares of Old CNC Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Programs and owe amounts
under the D&O Credit Facilities or to New CNC and Reorganized CIHC as part of
the Stock Programs:

               (a) New CNC and Reorganized CIHC, in settlement of any good faith
claims(11) such Participant may have in any manner relating to the D&O Credit
Facilities, the Stock Programs, or any

-----------------
11   Pursuant to an order entered on February 19, 2003, the claims bar date for
     Participants is 60 days after the Effective Date. As of the date the
     amended Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court, it appears that very few
     Participants have filed a proof of claim against any Reorganizing Debtor.
     Any Participant who executes an Adjustment Agreement will release his or
     her claims against the Reorganizing Debtors related to the D&O Credit
     Facilities, Stock Programs and any Work-Down Plan.


                                      -73-
<PAGE>

Work-Down Plan, shall offer a Purchase Price Adjustment Agreement substantially
in the form attached as Exhibit H hereto (the "Adjustment Agreement") to such
Participant pursuant to which (i) the Participant's initial loan amounts shall
be reduced to an amount equal to an agreeable price(12) per share for the shares
purchased by such Participant (the "Adjusted Purchase Amount"), and (ii) New CNC
and Reorganized CIHC shall cause their affiliate Conseco Services to execute the
Adjustment Agreement and to reduce any loans such Participant owes to Conseco
Services related to the D&O Credit Facilities and/or the Stock Programs to an
amount calculated on an agreeable price per share for the shares purchased by
such Participant (the "Adjusted Interest Amount"); provided, however, that under
the Adjustment Agreement:

               (i) Participant shall (A) pay to New CNC the Adjusted Purchase
     Amount and (B) pay to Conseco Services the Adjusted Interest Amount within
     90 days after the Participant signs the Adjustment Agreement, but if
     payment is not made on such date, Participant shall owe (A) New CNC 4% per
     annum simple interest on the Adjusted Purchase Amount, accruing as of the
     91st day, and (B) Conseco Services 4% per annum simple interest on the
     Adjusted Interest Amount, accruing as of the 91st day.

               (ii) Participant releases New CNC, Reorganized CIHC, the original
     lenders under the D&O Credit Facilities (and their successors and assigns),
     their respective affiliates, and the respective officers, directors,
     employees, agents (including financial consultants) and attorneys of the
     original lenders under the D&O Credit Facilities (and of their successors
     and assigns) (collectively, the "SP Releasees") from any and all claims the
     Participant may have with respect to the D&O Credit Facilities, his or her
     participation in the Stock Programs or any Work-Down Plan, and/or the Plan,
     but Participant reserves all rights against the Ineligible Persons (as
     defined below) and all others (other than the SP Releasees) who were
     involved in the D&O Credit Facilities and/or the Stock Programs (such
     others (other than the SP Releasees) together with the Ineligible Persons,
     the "Non-Released Entities") and waives no causes of action, setoffs,
     claims, rights, defenses, powers, and/or remedies (or similar matters),
     whether under the pertinent loan documents, applicable law or otherwise,
     against the Non-Released Entities and/or the Non-Released Entities' past,
     present or future property (including any such property that may be in the
     hands of any immediate or mediate transferee), all regardless of whether
     New CNC or Reorganized CIHC asserts or exercises (or does not assert or
     exercise, as the case may be) similar causes of action, setoffs, claims,
     rights, defenses and/or remedies (or similar matters) (in any combination)
     against any other person or entity.

               (iii) Upon Participant's payment of (A) the Adjusted Purchase
     Amount to New CNC and (B) the Adjusted Interest Amount to Conseco Services,
     New CNC, Reorganized CIHC, and Conseco Services and their respective
     affiliates shall release the Participant from any claims with respect to
     the D&O Credit Facilities, Stock Programs or any Work-Down Plan, but New
     CNC, Reorganized CIHC and Conseco Services (A) waive no other causes of
     action, setoffs, claims, rights, defenses, powers, and/or remedies (or
     similar matters) against Participant and (B) New CNC, Reorganized CIHC and
     Conseco Services reserve all rights against Non-Released Entities and waive
     no causes of action, setoffs, claims, rights, defenses, powers, and/or
     remedies (or similar matters), whether under the pertinent loan documents,
     applicable law or otherwise, against the Non-Released Entities and/or the
     Non-Released Entities' past, present or future property (including any such
     property that may be in the hands of any immediate or mediate transferee),
     all regardless of whether New CNC or Reorganized CIHC asserts or exercises
     (or does not assert or exercise, as the case may be) similar causes of
     action, setoffs, claims, rights, defenses and/or remedies (or similar
     matters) (in any combination) against any other person or entity.

               (iv) Participant assigns to New CNC his or her rights against the
     Non-Released Entities.

               (b) Pursuant to Section III.C.4.c of the Plan, New CNC shall
succeed to the Lenders' right, title and interest in the loans underlying the
D&O Credit Facilities.

----------------------
12   New CNC and Reorganized CIHC shall negotiate with each Participant an
     agreeable price per share unique to such Participant. New CNC and
     Reorganized CIHC shall not be obliged to offer the same price to all
     Participants.

                                      -74-
<PAGE>


               (c) The following are ineligible to be offered an Adjustment
Agreement (collectively, "Ineligible Persons"): (i) persons or entities that
purchased more than 40,000 shares of Old CNC Common Stock and owe amounts under
the D&O Credit Facilities or to New CNC or Reorganized CIHC as part of the Stock
Programs, (ii) Participants who are offered an Adjustment Agreement under
paragraph (a) above but who, for whatever reason, refuse to sign an Adjustment
Agreement, and (ii) Participants who are not offered an Adjustment Agreement
under paragraph (d) below.

               (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, New CNC and Reorganized
CIHC may choose not to offer an Adjustment Agreement to any Participant who
purchased 40,000 or less shares who New CNC and Reorganized CIHC reasonably
believe directed and/or authorized (i) the implementation of the Stock Program,
(ii) the number of shares (or aggregate purchase price) of Conseco, Inc. common
stock to be purchased in the aggregate pursuant to the Stock Program and/or
(iii) the selection of individuals eligible to participate in the Stock Program
and/or their permitted level of participation. The fact that a Participant is or
is not a current employee of New CNC, Reorganized CIHC or any affiliate shall
not be a factor in determining whether New CNC and Reorganized CIHC offer a
Participant an Adjustment Agreement.

          The form of Adjustment Agreement attached as Exhibit H hereto shall be
executed on an individualized basis by the Reorganized Debtors and Participants
that are offered it and choose to sign it and, in addition to the other
restrictions set forth herein, no Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of the Adjustment Agreement absent such execution and delivery of the Adjustment
Agreement. Participants who are offered the Adjustment Agreement may choose to
decline to sign it, but in such event, any such declining Participants shall
become Ineligible Persons.

          The Debtors have determined based on several different business and
legal considerations to offer Adjustment Agreements to Participants, subject to
the foregoing conditions, and their decision to do so shall in no manner be
deemed to be an admission (or by any other Person) as to the accuracy of any
factual statement or legal theory underlying any such good faith claims on the
part of any such Participant or any other borrower under the D&O Credit
Facilities, but on the contrary, the Debtors deny the legal validity or
enforceability of any such claims or defenses and expressly reserves any and all
of their claims, defenses, rights, powers and/or remedies against any such
Participant in the event that the Plan is not confirmed and against Ineligible
Persons, whether or not the Plan is confirmed. The decision to offer an
Adjustment Agreement to a Participant under the foregoing terms and conditions
has been made in connection with and is a part of the Plan and, as such, is
independent of and is expressly not a renewal or extension of any Work-Down
Plan, and shall not be deemed to be a renewal or extension of any Work-Down Plan
under any circumstances.

          Loans arising under the D&O Credit Facilities and the Stock Programs
that are owed by eleven Ineligible Persons constitute approximately 90% of the
loans outstanding under the D&O Credit Facilities, including Rollin M. Dick and
Stephen Hilbert, who owe approximately $92,921,300 and $209,190,716,
respectively. The Debtors intend to pursue amounts owed by certain Ineligible
Persons.

          The base salaries (excluding bonuses) for employees that are
Participants is between $56,000 and $350,000, and the average base salary is
$155,317. The Debtors believe that offering Adjustment Agreements to
Participants is in creditors' best interest for a number of reasons. Many
Participants have raised (formally or informally) good faith claims (including
misrepresentation and coercion) that they are not liable to repay their loans
under the D&O Credit Facilities. Although the Debtors have reasonable defenses
to these good faith claims, the Debtors' ability to collect any significant
amounts from Participants is in substantial doubt, and the mere process of
trying to defend against so many claims from so many different individuals would
be burdensome, expensive and distracting to the Debtors and their employees.
Offering Adjustment Agreements to Participants will allow the Debtors to focus
their efforts against those obligors who owe the largest amounts under the D&O
Credit Facilities and from whom the Debtors have the greatest potential
recovery.

          Each executed Adjustment Agreement should have the following tax
consequences: (i) New CNC and Reorganized CIHC will not claim a deduction to the
extent the loans are reduced under the Adjustment Agreement, (ii) the
Participant's basis in the stock should be reduced, but the Participant should
not

                                      -75-
<PAGE>

recognize income to the extent his or her loans are reduced under the Adjustment
Agreement, and (iii) New CNC and Reorganized CIHC will not pay the Participant
cash on account of the loans being reduced under the Adjustment Agreement.

          6.   Debtors' Causes of Action

          As discussed in Section VI.L.5 below, the Debtors have preserved their
rights with respect to certain claims and causes of action under the Plan. As of
the date hereof, the Debtors cannot predict with certainty the amount or value
of any recoveries they might achieve with respect to such claims or causes of
action as such amounts or values are speculative. Before the Petition Date, the
Debtors had retained over 30 advisors in connection with various legal,
financial and management matters. The Debtors believe that they have no
potential causes of action against these parties, but have not conducted any
formal investigation of potential claims. The Debtors have provided a list of
the advisors to the TOPrS Committee to facilitate its investigation. As
indicated in paragraph 5 above, the Debtors intend to pursue amounts owed by
certain obligors under the D&O Credit Facilities. As of the date hereof, the
Debtors believe that any recoveries that may be achieved with respect to such
claims are speculative.

          Included in the Plan Supplement is a list of payments that were
scheduled in the Debtors' Statement of Financial Affairs (items 3.a and 3.b).
These payments may be avoided under various sections of the Bankruptcy Code.
These payments total approximately $1.801 billion, but $1.728 billion of that
amount relates to intercompany transfers. The value of causes of action premised
on avoidance actions under the Bankruptcy Code is speculative, and the Debtors
have not analyzed the defenses to such actions. Moreover, if any Person is
required to disgorge monies pursuant to sections 547, 548, 549, 550 or 553 of
the Bankruptcy Code, then such Person has a right to file a proof of claim
pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3002(c)(3). Such Claims would
be classified as general unsecured claims, and to the extent they are Allowed
against CIHC, are senior to the Trust Related Claims. Even if the preferences
and other transfers described in CIHC's Statement of Financial Affairs are
recovered in full, the general unsecured claims against CIHC class would expand
to consume any additional value created by such recoveries at the CIHC level. To
the extent such Claims are Allowed against CNC, they would share such recoveries
with the Trust Related Claims. In any event, the Trust Related Claims would be
required to contribute their recoveries to the Claims that benefit from
subordination provisions in prepetition agreements until such senior creditors
are paid in full.

H.        TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

          1.   Reorganizing Debtors: Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

          Immediately prior to the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided
in the Plan, all executory contracts, including without limitation, the
prepetition engagement letters for the financial and legal advisors of the
Unofficial Bank Committee and the Unofficial Noteholder Committee, respectively,
stipulation agreements entered into with Distribution Agents during these
Chapter 11 Cases, or unexpired leases of the Reorganizing Debtors will be deemed
assumed in accordance with the provisions and requirements of sections 365 and
1123 of the Bankruptcy Code except those executory contracts and unexpired
leases that (1) have been rejected by order of the Bankruptcy Court, (2) have
previously been assumed by order of the Bankruptcy Court, (3) are the subject of
a motion to reject pending on the Effective Date, (4) are identified in the Plan
Supplement to be rejected, (5) that relate to the purchase or other acquisition
of Equity Interests. Entry of the Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court
shall constitute approval of such assumptions and rejections pursuant to
sections 365(a) and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          2.   Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired
               Leases

          All Proofs of Claims with respect to Claims arising from the rejection
of executory contracts or unexpired leases, if any, must be Filed with the
Bankruptcy Court within thirty (30) days after the date of entry of an order of
the Bankruptcy Court approving such rejection (which order, in the case of
executory contracts or unexpired leases rejected pursuant to the Plan, shall be
the Confirmation Order). Any Claims arising from the rejection of an executory
contract or unexpired lease not Filed within such time will be

                                      -76-
<PAGE>

forever barred from assertion against any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, any
Estate or property of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor unless otherwise ordered
by the Bankruptcy Court. All Allowed Claims arising from the rejection of
executory contracts or unexpired leases of the Reorganizing Debtors will be
classified as Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

          3.   Cure of Defaults for Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases
               Assumed

          Any monetary amounts by which each executory contract and unexpired
lease to be assumed pursuant to the Plan is in default shall be satisfied,
pursuant to section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, by payment of the default
amount in Cash on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is practicable,
or on such other terms as the parties to such executory contracts or unexpired
leases may otherwise agree. In the event of a dispute regarding: (1) the amount
of any cure payments, (2) the ability of the relevant Reorganized Debtor or any
assignee to provide "adequate assurance of future performance" (within the
meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under the contract or lease to be
assumed, or (3) any other matter pertaining to assumption, the cure payments
required by section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be made following the
entry of a Final Order resolving the dispute and approving the assumption.

          Ten days before the Confirmation Hearing, the Debtors will contact
relevant contract counter-parties with the Stated Cure Amounts (if any) for all
executory contracts and unexpired leases to be assumed pursuant to the Plan.

          4.   Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees

          The obligations of any Debtor to indemnify any Releasee serving at any
time on or after the Petition Date as one of its directors, officers or
employees by reason of such Releasee's service in such capacity, or as a
director, officer or employee of any other corporation or legal entity, to the
extent provided in such Debtor's constitutive documents, by a written agreement
with such Debtor or under applicable state corporate law (to the maximum extent
permitted thereunder), shall be deemed and treated as executory contracts that
are assumed by the relevant Reorganized Debtor (it being understood that New CNC
is the relevant Reorganized Debtor of CNC) pursuant hereto and section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective Date. Accordingly, such indemnification
obligations shall survive Unimpaired and unaffected by entry of the Confirmation
Order, irrespective of whether such indemnification is owed for an act or event
occurring before or after the Petition Date. The Conseco Creditors Committee has
not yet agreed to this provision and has advised the Debtors it is opposed to
this provision in its current form.

          Under Article X.C of the Plan, only Holders of Claims (a) who accept
the Plan or (b) who receive a distribution under the Plan release the Releasees.
As a result, certain Holders of Equity Interests (Classes 14A and 11B) will not
release the Releasees, and the Releasees may continue to have exposure for
unreleased matters. To the extent that the Reorganized Debtors assume
indemnification obligations owed to the Releasees under Article VI.D of the
Plan, those obligations will be transformed into post Effective Date claims that
the Reorganized Debtors must pay in full (because they have indemnified the
Releasees for such claims).

          5.   Compensation and Benefit Programs

          Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all employment and
severance agreements and policies, and all compensation and benefit plans,
policies, and programs of the Debtors applicable to their respective employees,
former employees, retirees and non-employee directors and the employees, former
employees and retirees of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all
savings plans, retirement plans, health care plans, disability plans, severance
benefit agreements and plans, incentive plans, deferred compensation plans and
life, accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans shall be treated as
executory contracts under the Plan and on the Effective Date shall be deemed
assumed pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy
Code; and the Debtors' obligations under such programs to Persons shall survive
confirmation of the Plan, except for (i) executory contracts or employee benefit
plans specifically rejected pursuant to the Plan (to the extent such rejection
does not violate sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code), (ii) all
employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and (iii) such executory
contracts or employee benefit plans as have previously been rejected, are the


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

subject of a motion to reject as of the Confirmation Date, or have been
specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan or
contract; provided however, that the Debtors' obligations, if any, to pay all
"retiree benefits" as defined in section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall
continue. The Reorganizing Debtors will determine what will happen to the CFC
pension plan when the terms of the proposed sale of CFC are more completely
developed. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has reserved its rights to
object to confirmation of the Plan for any reason.

          6.   Assumption of D&O Insurance

          All directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
by the Debtors are hereby assumed. Entry of the order confirming the Plan by the
clerk of the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such assumptions
pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Reorganized Debtors shall
maintain for a period not less than 10 years from the Effective Date coverage
for the individuals covered, as of the Petition Date, by such policies at levels
and on terms no less favorable to such individuals than the terms and levels
provided for under the policies assumed pursuant to the Plan. Solely with
respect to directors and officers of any of the Debtors who served in such
capacity at any time on or after the Petition Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
to assume, as of the Effective Date, their respective obligations to indemnify
such individuals (and only such individuals) with respect to or based upon any
act or omission taken or omitted in any of such capacities, or for or on behalf
of any Debtor, pursuant to and to the extent provided by the Debtors' respective
articles of incorporation, certificates of formation, corporate charters, bylaws
and similar corporate documents as in effect as of the date of entry of the
Confirmation Order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Plan, such assumed indemnity obligations shall not be discharged, Impaired, or
otherwise modified by confirmation of the Plan and shall be deemed and treated
as executory contracts that have been assumed by the Debtors pursuant to the
Plan as to which no proofs of claim need be Filed. The Conseco Creditors
Committee has not yet agreed to this provision and has advised the Debtors that
it is opposed to the maintenance of coverage as described above.

          The exact cost to the Debtors to maintain D&O insurance over the next
ten years cannot be calculated with reasonable certainty. Specifically, the cost
of such insurance is highly dependent on varying conditions in the market and
the make-up of the Debtors upon confirmation of any plan of reorganization. For
example, due to increases in the size and frequency of losses in connection with
D&O insurance in the market generally, there has been a general increase in the
cost of D&O insurance over the last two years. Key loss-factors have included,
but are not limited to: (i) stock volatility, (ii) poor financial conditions,
(iii) M&A activity, (iv) insider trading, (v) companies overstating revenues or
earnings, leading to financial restatements, and (vi) accounting irregularities.

          As such, while D&O premiums were somewhat predictable for the years
1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the issues noted above, as well as the overall state
of the insurance market, reinsurance market, economy, and the Debtors' uncertain
future exposure, make it impossible to predict future costs of D&O insurance for
the Debtors over the next ten years. The following list identifies the Debtors'
historic annual premiums for D&O insurance, (including coverage of CFC and
CFSC).

1999-2000                             $100,000,000                        $633,350

2000-2001                             $150,000,000                        $1,886,600

2001-2002                             $125,000,000                        $3,077,050*

2002-2003                             $50,000,000                         $11,250,000

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

          The Debtors do not believe that the annual premium paid in 2002-2003
is representative of the likely cost to maintain tail insurance coverage
following the Effective Date, but, in light of current uncertainties and the
factors described above, no assurance can be given as to the future costs for
this insurance. Because the insurance coverage obligations only relate to acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Date, the costs of this
coverage are expected to decline over time. Furthermore, acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Petition Date are generally covered by the 2001-2002
policy to the extent claims are made prior to the end of the discovery period on
December 18, 2003, and acts or omissions occurring during the 2002-2003 policy
period (December 18, 2002 through December 18, 2003) are generally covered by
the 2002-2003 policy to the extent claims are made prior to the expiration of
the policy period. The availability of this existing insurance coverage,
together with the exculpation described in Section VI.L.4. below, is expected to
significantly reduce the future cost of D&O tail insurance coverage, though the
Debtors are not currently able to estimate that cost at this time, for the
reasons discussed above.

I.        PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS

          1.   Distributions for Claims and Equity Interests Allowed as of the
               Effective Date

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or as may be ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court, distributions to be made on the Effective Date on account of
Claims and Equity Interests that are Allowed as of the Effective Date and are
entitled to receive distributions under the Plan shall be made on the Effective
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

          For purposes of determining the accrual of interest, dividends or
rights in respect of any other payment from and after the Effective Date, the
New Tranche A Bank Debt, the New Tranche B Bank Debt, the New Senior Notes, New
CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Warrants and New CNC Common Stock shall be deemed
issued as of the Effective Date regardless of the date on which they are
actually dated, authenticated or distributed; provided that the respective
Reorganized Debtor shall withhold any actual payment until such distribution is
made and no interest shall accrue or otherwise be payable on any such withheld
amounts.

          2.   Distributions by the Distribution Agent(s)

          The Debtors shall have the authority, in their sole discretion, to
enter into agreements with one or more Distribution Agents, to facilitate the
solicitation of votes on the Reorganizing Subplans and distributions required
under the Reorganizing Subplans. As a condition to serving as a Distribution
Agent, a Distribution Agent must (i) affirm its obligation to facilitate the
prompt distribution of any documents or solicitation materials, (ii) affirm its
obligation to facilitate the prompt distribution of any recoveries or
distributions required under the Reorganizing Subplan at issue, and (iii) waive
any right or ability to setoff against, deduct from, or assert any lien or
encumbrance against the distributions required under the Reorganizing Subplan
that are to be distributed by such Distribution Agent. In consideration for
waiving its rights to setoff, deduct from or assert any lien or encumbrance
against such distributions, the Debtors shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses (whether prepetition or postpetition) of such Distribution Agent. The
Distribution Agent shall submit detailed invoices to the Debtors for all fees
and expenses for which the Distribution Agent seeks reimbursement. The Debtors,
upon review of such invoices, shall pay those amounts the Debtors, in their sole
discretion, deem reasonable, and shall object in writing to those fees and
expenses, if any, that the Debtors deem to be unreasonable. In the event that
the Debtors object to all or any portion of a Distribution Agent's invoice, the
Debtors and such Distribution Agent will endeavor, in good faith, to reach
mutual agreement on the amount of such disputed fees and/or expenses. In the
event that the Debtors and a Distribution Agent are unable to resolve any
differences regarding disputed fees or expenses, either party shall be
authorized to move to have such dispute heard by the Bankruptcy Court. To the
extent the Debtors and any Distribution Agent entered into a stipulation during
these Chapter 11 Cases concerning the fees of such Distribution Agent, such
stipulations are assumed hereunder and the payment obligations evidenced thereby
shall become obligations of the Reorganized Debtors to the extent such
obligations remain unpaid as of the Effective Date.

                                      -79-
<PAGE>


          3.   Delivery and Distributions and Undeliverable or Unclaimed
               Distributions

               (a)     Delivery of Distributions in General

          Distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests shall be made to the Holders of such Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests as of the Distribution Record Date. Except as otherwise provided in
Article VIII.D.2 of the Plan, distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Equity Interests shall be made at the address of the Holder of such
Claim or Equity Interest as indicated on the records of the Debtors as of the
date that such distribution is made.

               (b)     Undeliverable Distributions

               (i)     Holding of Undeliverable Distributions.

               If any distribution to a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interest is returned to a Distribution Agent as undeliverable, no further
distributions shall be made to such Holder unless and until such Distribution
Agent is notified in writing of such Holder's then-current address.
Undeliverable distributions shall remain in the possession of such Distribution
Agent subject to Article VIII.C.2.b of the Plan until such time as a
distribution becomes deliverable. Undeliverable Cash shall not be entitled to
any interest, dividends or other accruals of any kind. As soon as reasonably
practicable, the Distribution Agent shall make all distributions that become
deliverable.

               (ii)    Failure to Claim Undeliverable Distributions

               In an effort to ensure that all Holders of Allowed Claims and
Equity Interests receive their allocated distributions, ninety (90) days after
the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court
a listing of unclaimed distribution. This list will be maintained for as long as
the Chapter 11 Cases stay open. Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest (irrespective of when a Claim or Equity Interest became an Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest) that does not assert a Claim or Equity Interest
pursuant hereto for an undeliverable distribution (regardless of when not
deliverable) within two years after the Effective Date shall have its Claim or
Equity Interest for such undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be
forever barred from asserting any such Claim or Equity Interest against the
relevant Reorganized Debtor or its property. In such cases: (i) any Cash held
for distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be property
of the relevant Reorganized Debtor or Liquidating Plan Administrator, free of
any restrictions thereon; and (ii) any securities issued under the Plan held for
distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be canceled and
of no further force or effect. Nothing contained in the Plan shall require the
Distribution Agent to attempt to locate any Holder of an Allowed Claim or
Allowed Equity Interest.

               (c)     Compliance with Tax Requirements/Allocations.

          In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, each
Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor and the Distribution Agent shall comply
with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any
governmental unit, and all distributions pursuant hereto shall be subject to
such withholding and reporting requirements. Each Reorganizing Debtor,
Reorganized Debtor and Distribution Agent shall be authorized to take all
actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting
requirements. For tax purposes, distributions received in respect of Allowed
Claims will be allocated first to the principal amount of Allowed Claims, with
any excess allocated to unpaid interest that accrued on such Claims.

          4.   Timing and Calculation of Amounts to be Distributed

         On the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Holder
of an Allowed Claim against or Allowed Equity Interest in the Debtors shall
receive the full amount of the distributions that the Plan provides for Allowed
Claims or Allowed Equity Interests in the applicable Class. If and to the extent
that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests, distributions on
account of such Disputed Claim or Equity Interest shall be made pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Article IX.A.3 of the Plan.

          5.   Minimum Distribution

          Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, payments of fractions
of shares of New CNC Common Stock or New CNC Preferred Stock or fractions of New
CNC Warrants will not be made and will be deemed to be zero. Any other provision
of the Plan notwithstanding, the Reorganized Debtors or a Distribution Agent
will not be required to make distributions or payments of fractions of dollars.
Whenever any payment of a fraction of a dollar under the Plan would otherwise be
called for, the actual payment will reflect a rounding of such fraction to the
nearest whole dollar (up or down), with half dollars or less being rounded down.

          6.   Setoffs

          Except as expressly provided for in the Plan, each Reorganizing Debtor
and Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code or applicable non-bankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan
on account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is
made on account of such Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor, as the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests,
rights or Causes of Action against such Holder have not been compromised or
settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise); provided that, neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest under the Plan shall constitute a
waiver or release by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such
Claims, Equity Interests, rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing
Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distributions contemplated by the Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note shall be offset against: (i) the CFC/CIHC
Intercompany Note, (ii) all other prepetition amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all
postpetition amounts owed by CFC that are not repaid in full in Cash by CFC,
including, without limitation, health and welfare benefits, insurance, other
direct CFC expenses and an appropriate allocation of the postpetition
professional fees paid by CIHC (which allocation will be filed by the
Reorganizing Debtors 10 days prior to the Confirmation Hearing) except to the
extent that prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court determines by Final
Order that such setoff or treatment may not be allowed under applicable law
(including the Bankruptcy Code). Any Net CFC Claims will be classified as Class
6B Claims.

          In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Finance
Company Debtors against all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Finance Company
Debtors to the Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts
owing under the prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) amounts owing as a result
of payments made on behalf of the Finance Company Debtors to Exl, (iii) an
appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees incurred by the
Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors in connection with their
restructuring and the preparation for these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv) prepetition
amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco Services or CIHC, and
(y) postpetition amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full in Cash, including without
limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments owed by the Finance Company
Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the postpetition professional fees
incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors during these Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) any
postpetition payments by the Reorganizing Debtors to Exl pursuant to the
guarantee by CNC of a transition services agreement between Exl and CFC, and
(iv) postpetition amounts owed by the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco
Services or CIHC except to the extent that prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy
Court determines by Final Order that such setoff or treatment may not be allowed
under applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code). To the extent any Net
Finance Company Debtors' Claims are Allowed Claims against CNC they will be
Class 8A Claims. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, all Net
Reorganizing Debtors' Claims shall be preserved and unaffected by the
confirmation of the Plan.

                                      -81-

          7.   Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities

          Subject to Article VIII.I of the Plan, each record Holder of an
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest relating to the (i) Senior Credit Facility,
(ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii) CNC Guarantee of D&O
Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (v) Exchange
Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated Debentures, (viii) CNC Common
Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates or other
documentation underlying such Claim or Equity Interest, and all such surrendered
certificates and other documentations shall be marked as canceled.

          8.   Failure to Surrender Canceled Instruments

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii)
CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchange Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that fails to
surrender or is deemed to have failed to surrender its certificates or other
documentation representing such Claim or Equity Interest required to be tendered
under the Plan within one year after the Effective Date shall have its Claim for
a distribution pursuant hereto on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interests discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting any such
Claim or Equity Interest against any Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or
the Distribution Agent or their assets.

          9.   Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Securities

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii)
CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchange Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that is
evidenced by a note or by a stock certificate which has been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed shall, in lieu of surrendering such note or stock
certificate, deliver to the Distribution Agent: (a) an affidavit of loss
reasonably satisfactory to the Distribution Agent setting forth the
unavailability of the note or the stock certificate; and (b) such additional
indemnity as may reasonably be required by the Distribution Agent to hold such
relevant Distribution Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs
incurred in treating such individual as a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest. Upon compliance with this procedure by a Holder of an Allowed Claim or
Equity Interest evidenced by such a lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed note or
stock certificate, such Holder shall, for all purposes under the Plan, be deemed
to have surrendered such note or certificate.

J.        PROCEDURES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED, CONTINGENT AND UNLIQUIDATED
          CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS

          1. Resolution of Disputed Claims

               (a)     Prosecution of Objections to Claims

          After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (for Claims against
the Reorganized Debtors) shall have the exclusive authority on or before the
Claims Objection Bar Date to file objections, settle, compromise, withdraw or
litigate to judgment objections to Claims or Equity Interests. From and after
the Effective Date, the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may settle or
compromise any Disputed Claim or Equity Interest without approval of the
Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors, the Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized
Debtors also reserve the right to resolve any Disputed Claims or Equity
Interests outside the Bankruptcy Court under applicable governing law.

               (b)     Estimation of Claims and Equity Interests

          The Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may, at any time,
request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim
or Equity Interest pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code regardless
of whether such Reorganizing Debtor and Reorganized

                                      -82-
<PAGE>

Debtor has previously objected to such Claim or Equity Interest or whether the
Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court will
retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim or Equity Interest at any time during
litigation concerning any objection to any Claim or Equity Interest, including
during the pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. In the event
that the Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that
estimated amount will constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a
maximum limitation on such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. If the
estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the relevant
Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental
proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All of the
aforementioned Claims or Equity Interests and objection, estimation and
resolution procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one
another. Claims and Equity Interests may be estimated and subsequently
compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by any mechanism approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

               (c)     Payments and Distributions on Disputed Claims and Equity
                       Interests

          Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, except as
otherwise agreed by a Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor (for Claims
against the Reorganizing Debtors) in their sole discretion, no partial payments
and no partial distributions will be made with respect to a Disputed Claim or
Equity Interest until the resolution of such disputes by settlement or Final
Order. On the date or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next
successive Business Day that is 20 calendar days after the calendar quarter in
which a Disputed Claim or Equity Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interest, the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest
will receive all payments and distributions to which such Holder is then
entitled under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person or Entity who
holds both an Allowed Claim(s) and a Disputed Claim(s) (or an Allowed Equity
Interest(s) and a Disputed Equity Interest(s)) will not receive the appropriate
payment or distribution on the Allowed Claim(s) (or Allowed Equity Interest(s)),
except as otherwise agreed by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as
the case may be, in its sole discretion, until the Disputed Claim(s) or Disputed
Equity Interest(s) are resolved by settlement or Final Order. In the event that
there are Disputed Claims or Equity Interests requiring adjudication and
resolution, the Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized Debtors reserve the right,
or upon order of the Court, to establish appropriate reserves for potential
payment of such Claims or Equity Interests.

          2.   Allowance of Claims and Equity Interests

          Except as expressly provided in the Plan or in any order entered in
the Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the Confirmation
Order), no Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed Allowed, unless and until
such Claim or Equity Interest is deemed Allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or the
Bankruptcy Court enters a Final Order in the Chapter 11 Cases allowing such
Claim or Equity Interest. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or any order
entered in the Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the
Confirmation Order) and the Reorganizing Debtors (for Claims against the
Reorganizing Debtors) or Reorganized Debtors after confirmation will have and
retain any and all rights and defenses such Debtor had with respect to any Claim
or Equity Interest as of the Petition Date.

          3.   Controversy Concerning Impairment

          If a controversy arises as to whether any Claims or Equity Interests,
or any Class of Claims or Equity Interests, are Impaired under the Plan, the
Bankruptcy Court shall, after notice and a hearing, determine such controversy
before the Confirmation Date.

          4.   Reserve of New CNC Common Stock

          On the Effective Date, CNC shall maintain in reserve shares of New CNC
Common Stock as the New CNC Common Stock Holdback. The New CNC Common Stock
Holdback, along with any dividends or other distributions accruing with respect
thereto, shall be held for the Holders of Disputed Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and
6B Claims and Equity Interests. As Disputed Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and 6B
Claims and Equity Interests are resolved, (a) CNC shall distribute, in
accordance with the terms hereof, New CNC Common Stock to Holders of Allowed
Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and 6B Claims and Equity Interests

                                      -83-
<PAGE>

(along with dividends and distributions that accrue after the Effective Date),
and (b) the New CNC Common Stock Holdback shall be adjusted.

L.        RELEASE, INJUNCTIVE AND RELATED PROVISIONS

          1.   Compromise and Settlement

          The allowance, classification and treatment of all Allowed Claims and
Equity Interests and the respective distributions and treatments under the Plan

legal and equitable subordination rights relating thereto whether arising under
general principles of equitable subordination, section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, and, as of the Effective Date, any and all such rights are
settled, compromised and released pursuant to the Plan. In addition, the
allowance, classification and treatment of Allowed Claims in Classes 4A, 5A, 6A,

whether under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law, that may exist

                                      -85-
<PAGE>


          2.   Releases by the Debtors

          Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan or in the Plan
Supplement, for good and valuable consideration, including the service of the
Releasees to facilitate the expeditious reorganization of the Debtors and the
implementation of the restructuring contemplated by the Plan, the Releasees, on
and after the Effective Date, are deemed released by the Debtors and the
Reorganized Debtors from any and all Claims (as defined in section 101(5) of the
Bankruptcy Code), obligations, rights, suits, damages, causes of action,
remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including any derivative Claims asserted on
behalf of a Debtor, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing
or hereafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors or their subsidiaries would have been legally entitled to
assert in their own right (whether individually or collectively) or on behalf of
the Holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or other Person or Entity, based in
whole or in part upon any act or omission, transaction, agreement, event or
other occurrence taking place on or before the Effective Date, other than Claims
or liabilities arising out of or relating to (a) any act or omission of a
Releasee that constituted (i) a failure to perform the duty to act in good
faith, with the care of an ordinarily prudent person and in a manner the
Releasee reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation (to
the extent such duty is imposed by applicable non-bankruptcy law), and (ii)
willful misconduct or recklessness(13), or (b) any Releasee's obligations to
repay its obligations under the D&O Credit Facilities. Before the Petition Date,
the Debtors had retained over 30 advisors in connection with various legal,
financial and management matters. The Debtors believe that they have no
potential causes of action against these parties, but have not conducted any
formal investigation of potential claims. The Debtors have provided a list of
the advisors to the TOPrS Committee to facilitate its investigation. As of the
Date of the Disclosure Statement, the Conseco Creditors Committee and the
Debtors have not agreed on the scope of these provisions, and the Conseco
Creditors Committee has advised the Debtors that it is opposed to these
provisions in their current form. The CFC Committee has also not agreed to the
scope of these provisions.

          3.   Releases by Holders of Claims

          On and after the Effective Date, each Holder of a Claim (a) who has
accepted the Plan or (b) who receives a distribution if the Plan is confirmed,
shall be deemed to have unconditionally released the Releasees from any and all
Claims (as defined in section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), obligations,
rights, suits, damages, Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever,
including any derivative Claims asserted on behalf of a Debtor, whether known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising, in law, equity
or otherwise, that such Person would have been legally entitled to assert
(whether individually or collectively), based in whole or in part upon any act
or omission, transaction, agreement, event or other occurrence taking place on
or before the Effective Date in any way relating or pertaining to (w) the
purchase or sale, or the rescission of a purchase or sale, of any security of a
Debtor, (x) a Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, (y) the Chapter 11 Cases, or (z) the
negotiation, formulation and preparation of the Plan or any related agreements,
instruments or other documents. No portion of the limited releases by the
Holders of Claims in any way impairs any Cause of Action, liability, Claim or
right arising out of or relating to (a) any act or omission of a Releasee that
constituted (i) a failure to perform the duty to act in good faith, with the
care of an ordinarily prudent person and in a manner the Releasee reasonably
believed to be in the best interests of the corporation (to the extent such duty
is imposed by applicable non-bankruptcy law), and (ii) willful misconduct or
recklessness, or (b) any Releasee's obligations to repay its obligations under
the D&O Credit Facilities. Attached as Exhibit J hereto is a list of the
lawsuits filed against the Releasees (and others) before the Petition Date. The
claims and causes of action relating to these lawsuits cannot be quantified at
this time because they have not been fully litigated or settled, and some were
recently filed. The status of such lawsuits is described in Exhibit J hereto. As
of the Date of the Disclosure Statement, the Conseco Creditors Committee and the
Debtors have not agreed on the scope of these provisions, and the Conseco
Creditors Committee has advised the Debtors that it is opposed to these
provisions in their current form. The CFC Committee has also not agreed to the
scope of these provisions.

                                      -86-
<PAGE>


          Certain parties, including the TOPrS Committee, the CFC Committee and
the SEC, have objected to the foregoing releases. The Debtors are prepared to
demonstrate in their memorandum of law in support of Confirmation of the Plan
and at the Confirmation Hearing that the foregoing releases, including, but not
limited to, the release of non-debtor third parties, are consistent with section
524(e) and section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code and case law promulgated
thereunder.

          4.   Exculpation

          The Debtors, the Releasees, Noteholder Subcommittee, Lender
Subcommittee and the Official Committees, the Unofficial Noteholder Committee,
Unofficial Bank Committee and their respective members, and the employees,
agents, and professionals of each of the foregoing (acting in such capacity)
shall neither have nor incur any liability to any Person for any pre or
postpetition act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or related to
the formulation, negotiation, preparation, dissemination, implementation,
administration, Confirmation or Consummation of the Plan, the Disclosure
Statement or any contract, instrument, release or other agreement or document
created or entered into in connection with the Plan or any other pre or
postpetition act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or in
contemplation of the restructuring of the Debtors.

          5.   Preservation of Rights of Action

               (a)     The Debtors' Retained Causes of Action

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors
shall retain all rights to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all
Causes of Action, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, in any
court or other tribunal including, without limitation, in an adversary
proceeding Filed in one or more of the Chapter 11 Cases, including the actions
specified in the Plan Supplement.

          The Debtors have reviewed available information regarding Causes of
Action against other parties or entities, which investigation has not been
completed and is ongoing, except with respect to compromises and settlements
under the Plan. In addition, due to the size and scope of the Debtors' business
operations and the multitude of business transactions therein, there may be
numerous other Causes of Actions which currently exist or may subsequently
arise, in addition to the matters identified below. The Debtors are also
continuing to investigate and assess which Causes of Action may be pursued. The
Debtors do not intend, and it should not be assumed that because any existing or
potential claims or Causes of Action have not yet been pursued by the Debtors or
do not fall within the list below, that any such claims or Causes or Action have
been waived. Under the Plan, the Debtors retain all rights to pursue any and all
Causes of Action to the extent the Debtors deem appropriate (under any theory of
law, including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable
local, state, or federal law, in any court or other tribunal, including, without
limitation, in an adversary proceeding Filed in the Chapter 11 Cases),
including, without limitation:

                    (i)    Objections to Claims under the Plan

                    (ii)   Any and all litigation or Causes of Action of the
                           Debtors relating to the Causes of Action listed in
                           the Plan Supplement

                    (iii)  Any other litigation or Causes of Action, whether
                           legal, equitable or statutory in nature, arising out
                           of, or in connection with the Debtors' businesses,
                           assets or operations or otherwise affecting the
                           Debtors, including, without limitation, possible
                           claims against the following types of parties for the
                           following types of claims:

                           o     Possible claims against vendors, customers or
                                 suppliers for warranty, indemnity, back
                                 charge/set-off issues, overpayment or duplicate

                           o     Possible Claims or Causes of Action against the
                                 Finance Company Debtors, including with respect
                                 to the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note.

               (b)     Preservation of All Causes of Action Not Expressly
                       Settled or Released

          Unless a Claim or Cause of Action against a Creditor or other Person
is expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in the Plan
or any Final Order, the Debtors expressly reserve such Claim or Cause of Action
for later adjudication by the Debtors, and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine,
including, without limitation, the doctrines of res judicata, collateral
estoppel, issue preclusion, Claim preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial,
equitable or otherwise) or laches shall apply to such Claims or Causes of Action
upon or after the confirmation or Consummation of the Plan based on the
Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the Confirmation Order, except where such
Claims or Causes of Action have been waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled in the Plan or a Final Order. In addition, the Debtors and the
successor entities under the Plan expressly reserve the right to pursue or adopt
any Claims not so waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled that
are alleged in any lawsuit in which the Debtors are a defendant or an interested
party, against any person or entity, including, without limitation, the
plaintiffs or co-defendants in such lawsuits.

          Any Person to whom the Debtors have incurred an obligation (whether on
account of services, purchase or sale of goods or otherwise), or who has
received services from the Debtors or a transfer of money or property of the
Debtors, or who has transacted business with the Debtors, or leased equipment or
property from the Debtors should assume that such obligation, transfer, or
transaction may be reviewed by the Debtors subsequent to the Effective Date and
may, to the extent not theretofore waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled, be the subject of an action after the Effective Date, whether or not
(i) such Person has Filed a proof of Claim against the Debtors in the Chapter 11
Cases; (ii) such Person's proof of Claim has been objected to; (iii) such
Person's Claim was included in the Debtors' Schedules; or (iv) such Person's
scheduled Claim has been objected to by the Debtors or has been identified by
the Debtors as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated.

          6.   Discharge of Claims and Termination of Equity Interests

         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, and except with respect to
the Finance Company Debtors: (1) the rights afforded in the Plan and the
treatment of all Claims and Equity Interests in the Plan shall be in exchange
for and in complete satisfaction, discharge and release of Claims and Equity
Interests of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued on Claims
from and after the Petition Date, against the Reorganizing or Reorganized
Debtors or any of their assets or properties, (2) on the Effective Date, all
such Claims against, and Equity Interests in, the Reorganizing or Reorganized
Debtors shall be satisfied, discharged and released in full and (3) all Persons
and Entities shall be precluded from asserting against the Reorganizing or
Reorganized Debtors, their successors or their assets or properties any other or
further Claims or Equity Interests based upon any act or omission, transaction
or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Confirmation
Date.

          7.   Injunction

          Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or obligations
issued pursuant to the Plan, all Persons who have held, hold or may hold Claims
against or Equity Interests in the Reorganizing Debtors or the Releasees are
permanently enjoined, from and after the Effective Date, from (a) commencing or
continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding of any kind on any such
Claim or Equity Interest against the Reorganized Debtors, Releasees, Noteholder
Subcommittee, Lender Subcommittee, Official Committees, Unofficial Noteholder
Committee, Unofficial Bank Committee and their respective members, and the
employees, agents, and professionals of each of the foregoing (acting in such
capacity); (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering by any manner or
means any judgment, award, decree or order against those parties listed in
subparagraph (a) above; (c) creating, perfecting, or enforcing any encumbrance
of any kind against those parties listed in subparagraph (a) above, or the
property or estates of those parties listed in subparagraph (a) above; (d)
asserting any right of setoff, subrogation or recoupment of any

                                      -89-
<PAGE>

kind against any obligation due from those parties listed in subparagraph (a)
above or against the property or estates of those parties listed in subparagraph
(a) above with respect to any such Claim or Equity Interest; and (e) commencing
or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding of any kind in
respect of any Claim or Cause of Action released or settled under the Plan.

M.        RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

          Notwithstanding the entry of the Confirmation Order and the occurrence
of the Effective Date, the Bankruptcy Court shall retain such jurisdiction over
the Chapter 11 Cases after the Effective Date as legally permissible, including
jurisdiction to:

               (a) allow, disallow, determine, liquidate, classify, estimate or
establish the priority or secured or unsecured status of any Claim or Equity
Interest, including the resolution of any request for payment of any
Administrative Claim and the resolution of any and all objections to the
allowance or priority of Claims or Equity Interests;

               (b) grant or deny any applications for allowance of compensation
or reimbursement of expenses authorized pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or the
Plan, for periods ending on or before the Effective Date;

               (c) resolve any matters related to the assumption, assumption and
assignment or rejection of any executory contract and unexpired lease to which a
Debtor is party or with respect to which a Debtor may be liable and to hear,
determine and, if necessary, liquidate, any Claims arising therefrom, including
those matters related to the amendment after the Effective Date pursuant to
Article V of the Plan to add any executory contracts or unexpired leases to the
list of executory contracts and unexpired leases to be rejected;

               (d) ensure that distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Equity Interests are accomplished pursuant to the provisions of the
Plan;

               (e) decide or resolve any motions, adversary proceedings,
contested or litigated matters and any other matters and grant or deny any
applications involving a Debtor that may be pending on the Effective Date;

               (f) enter such orders as may be necessary or appropriate to
implement or consummate the provisions hereof and all contracts, instruments,
releases, indentures and other agreements or documents created in connection
with the Plan or the Disclosure Statement;

               (g) resolve any cases, controversies, suits or disputes that may
arise in connection with the Consummation, interpretation or enforcement of the
Plan or any Person's obligations incurred in connection with the Plan;

               (h) issue injunctions, enter and implement other orders or take

respect to the releases, injunction and other provisions contained in Article XI

Cases.

N.        MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          Certain additional miscellaneous information regarding the Plan and
the Chapter 11 Cases is set forth below.

          1.   Modification of the Plan Supplement

          Modification of or amendments to the Plan Supplement, may be Filed
with the Bankruptcy Court no later than ten days before the Confirmation
Hearing. Any such modification or supplement shall be considered a modification
of the Plan and shall be made in accordance with Article XII.E of the Plan. Upon
its Filing, the Plan Supplement may be inspected in the office of the clerk of
the Bankruptcy Court or its designee during normal business hours. Holders of
Claims and Equity Interests may obtain a copy of the Plan Supplement by
contacting Bankruptcy Management Corporation at 1-888-909-0100 or review such
documents on the internet at www.bmccorp.net/conseco. The documents contained in
the Plan Supplement are an integral part of the Plan and shall be approved by
the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the Confirmation Order.

          2.   Effectuating Documents, Further Transactions and Corporation
               Action

          Each of the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors is authorized to
execute, deliver, file or record such contracts, instruments, releases and other
agreements or documents and take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate, implement and further evidence the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the notes and securities issued pursuant hereto.

          Prior to, on or after the Effective Date (as appropriate), all matters
provided for under the Plan that would otherwise require approval of the
shareholders or directors of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors shall be
deemed to have occurred and shall be in effect prior to, on or after the
Effective Date (as appropriate) pursuant to the applicable general corporation
laws of the State of Delaware, the State of Indiana or the State of Illinois
without any requirement of further action by the shareholders or directors of
the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors.

          3.   Dissolution of the Official Committees

          Upon the Effective Date, the Official Committees shall dissolve,
except with respect to any appeal of an order in the Chapter 11 Cases and
applications for Professional Fees, and members shall be released and discharged
from all rights, duties and liabilities arising from, or related to, the Chapter
11 Cases.

          4.   Payment of Statutory Fees

          All fees payable pursuant to section 1930(a) of Title 28 of the United
States Code, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court at the hearing pursuant to
section 1128 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be paid for each quarter (including
any fraction thereof) until the Chapter 11 Cases are converted, dismissed or
closed, whichever occurs first.

          5.   Modification of Plan

          Subject to the limitations contained in the Plan, (1) the Debtors
reserve the right, in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy
Rules, to amend or modify the Plan prior to the entry of the Confirmation Order;
and (2) after the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Debtors or Reorganized
Debtors, as the case may be, may (with the consent of the Conseco Creditors
Committees whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied),
upon order of the Bankruptcy Court, amend or modify the Plan, in accordance with
section 1127(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, or remedy any defect or omission or
reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan, provided however, that (i) no
material modification of the Plan that adversely affects the treatment of Class
6A, 7A, or 5B shall be made without the written consent of the Noteholder
Subcommittee and (ii) no material modification of the Plan that adversely
affects the treatment of Classes 5A or 4B shall be made without the written
consent of the Lender Subcommittee.

<PAGE>


          6.   Revocation of Plan

          The Debtors reserve the right (with the prior consent of the Conseco
Creditors Committee) to revoke or withdraw the Plan prior to the Confirmation
Date and to file subsequent plans of reorganization. If a Debtor revokes or
withdraws the Plan, or if Confirmation or Consummation does not occur, then (a)
the Plan shall be null and void in all respects, (b) any settlement or
compromise embodied in the Plan (including the fixing or limiting to an amount
certain any Claim or Equity Interest or Class of Claims or Equity Interests),
assumption or rejection of executory contracts or leases affected by the Plan,
and any document or agreement executed pursuant hereto, shall be deemed null and
void, and (c) nothing contained in the Plan shall (i) constitute a waiver or
release of any Claims by or against, or any Equity Interests in, such Debtor or
any other Person, (ii) prejudice in any manner the rights of such Debtor or any
other Person, or (iii) constitute an admission of any sort by such Debtor or any
other Person.

          7.   Successors and Assigns

          The rights, benefits and obligations of any Person named or referred
to in the Plan shall be binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of such Person.

          8.   Reservation of Rights

          Except as expressly set forth in the Plan, the Plan shall have no
force or effect unless the Bankruptcy Court shall enter the Confirmation Order.
None of the filing of the Plan, any statement or provision contained in the
Plan, or the taking of any action by any Debtor with respect to the Plan, the
Disclosure Statement or Plan Supplement, shall be or shall be deemed to be an
admission or waiver of any rights of Debtor with respect to the Holders of
Claims or Equity Interests prior to the Effective Date.

          9.   Section 1145 Exemption

          Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code exempts the offer and sale
of securities under a plan of reorganization from registration under section 5
of the Securities Act and state laws if three principal requirements are
satisfied: (i) the securities must be offered and sold under a plan of
reorganization and must be securities of the debtor, of an affiliate
participating in a joint plan with the debtor, or of a successor to the debtor
under the plan; (ii) the recipients of the securities must hold claims against
or interests in the debtor; and (iii) the securities must be issued in exchange
(or principally in exchange) for the recipient's claims against or interests in
the debtor. The Debtors believe that the offer and sale of the New CNC
Securities under the Plan satisfy the requirements of section 1145(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code and are, therefore, exempt from registration under the
Securities Act and state securities laws.

          To the extent that the New CNC Securities are issued under the Plan
and are covered by section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, they may be resold
by the holders thereof without registration unless, as more fully described
below, the holder is an "underwriter" with respect to such securities.
Generally, section 1145(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code defines an "underwriter" as
any person who: (i) purchases a claim against, an interest in, or a claim for an
administrative expense against the debtor, if such purchase is with a view to
distributing any security received in exchange for such a claim or interest;
(ii) offers to sell securities offered under a plan for the holders of such
securities; (iii) offers to buy such securities from the holders of such
securities, if the offer to buy is: (A) with a view to distributing such
securities; and (B) under an agreement made in connection with the plan, the
consummation of the plan, or with the offer or sale of securities under the
plan; or (iv) is an "issuer" with respect to the securities, as the term
"issuer" is defined in section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act.

          Under section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, an "issuer" includes any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any
person under direct or indirect common control of the issuer. To the extent that
Persons who receive New CNC Securities pursuant to the Plan are deemed to be
"underwriters" as defined in section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, resales by
such Persons would not be exempted by section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code from
registration under the Securities Act or other applicable law. Such Persons
would, however, be permitted to sell such New CNC Securities or other securities
without registration if they are able to comply with the provisions of Rule 144
under the

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

Securities Act. These rules permit the public sale of securities received by
such Person if current information regarding the issuer is publicly available
and if volume limitations and certain other conditions are met. Any person who
is an "underwriter" but not an "issuer" with respect to an issue of securities
is, however, entitled to engage in exempt "ordinary trading transactions" within
the meaning of section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          Whether or not any particular person would be deemed to be an
"underwriter" with respect to the New CNC Securities to be issued pursuant to
the Plan would depend upon various facts and circumstances applicable to that
person. Accordingly, the Debtors express no view as to whether any particular
Person receiving New CNC Securities under the Plan would be an "underwriter"
with respect to such New CNC Securities.

          Given the complex and subjective nature of the question of whether a
particular holder may be an underwriter, the Debtors make no representation
concerning the right of any Person to trade in the New CNC Securities. The
Debtors recommend that potential recipients of the New CNC Securities consult
their own counsel concerning whether they may freely trade New Securities
without compliance with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or similar state
and federal laws.

          New CNC will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement containing the
terms set forth in the Plan Supplement, pursuant to which it will undertake to
use reasonable best efforts to register New CNC Securities on behalf of Persons
who may be "underwriters."

          10.  Section 1146 Exemption

          Pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, under the Plan,
(i) the issuance, distribution, transfer or exchange of any debt, equity
security or other interest in the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors; (ii) the
creation, modification, consolidation or recording of any mortgage, deed of
trust, or other security interest, or the securing of additional indebtedness by
such or other means; (iii) the making, assignment or recording of any lease or
sublease; or (iv) the making, delivery or recording of any deed or other
instrument of transfer under, in furtherance of, or in connection with, the
Plan, including any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or other instrument of
transfer executed in connection with any transaction arising out of,
contemplated by, or in any way related to the Plan shall not be subject to any
document recording tax, mortgage recording tax, stamp tax or similar government
assessment, and the appropriate state or local government official or agent
shall be directed by the Bankruptcy Court to forego the collection of any such
tax or government assessment and to accept for filing and recording any of the
foregoing instruments or other documents without the payment of any such tax or
government assessment.

          All subsequent issuances, transfers or exchanges of securities, or the
making or delivery of any instrument of transfer by the Debtors in the Chapter
11 Cases, whether in connection with a sale under section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, shall be deemed to be or have been done in furtherance of the
Plan. Specifically, because sale of the GM Building (or the entities owning the
GM Building or the interest therein), is being conducted pursuant to the Plan,
any instrument of transfer that would effect transfer of the GM Building as
proposed in pleadings filed in these Chapter 11 Cases may not be taxed under any
law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.

          11.  Further Assurances

          The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors and all Holders of Claims
receiving distributions under the Plan and all other parties in interest shall,
from time to time, prepare, execute and deliver any agreements or documents and
take any other actions as may be necessary or advisable to effectuate the
provisions and intent of the Plan.

          12.  Service of Documents

          Any pleading, notice or other document required by the Plan to be
served on or delivered to the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors shall be sent
by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid to:

          13.  Transactions on Business Days

          If the date on which a transaction may occur under the Plan shall

          On or before the Effective Date, the Debtors may file with the
Bankruptcy Court such agreements and other documents as may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate and further evidence the terms and conditions of the
Plan.

          15.  Term of Injunctions or Stays

          Unless otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Confirmation Order,
all injunctions or stays in effect in the Chapter 11 Cases under sections 105 or
362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any order of the Bankruptcy Court, and extant on
the Confirmation Date (excluding any injunctions or stays contained in the Plan
or the Confirmation Order) shall remain in full force and effect until the
Effective Date. All injunctions or stays contained in the Plan or the
Confirmation Order shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

          16.  Entire Agreement

                        VOTING AND CONFIRMATION PROCEDURE

          The following is a brief summary regarding the acceptance and
confirmation of the Plan. Holders of Claims and Equity Interests are encouraged
to review the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and/or to consult their
own attorneys. Additional information regarding voting procedures is set forth
in the Notices accompanying this Disclosure Statement.

A.        VOTING INSTRUCTIONS

          This Disclosure Statement, accompanied by a Ballot to be used for
voting on the Plan, is being distributed to Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests in Classes 4A, 5A-1, 5A-2, 6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1,

<PAGE>

4B-1, 4B-2, 5B, 6B and 3C. Only Holders in these Classes are entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan and may do so by completing the Ballot and returning
it in the envelope provided. Beneficial owners who receive a return envelope
addressed to their Nominee should allow enough time for their vote to be
received by the Nominee and processed on a Master Ballot. In light of the
benefits of the Plan for each Class of Claims and Equity Interests, the Debtors
recommend that Holders of Claims and Equity Interests in each of the Impaired
Classes vote to accept the Plan and return the Ballot.

          BALLOTS AND MASTER BALLOTS CAST BY HOLDERS IN CLASSES ENTITLED TO VOTE
MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE SOLICITATION AGENT BY THE VOTING DEADLINE AT THE

          ANY BALLOT WHICH IS EXECUTED BY THE HOLDER OF AN ALLOWED CLAIM OR
EQUITY INTEREST OR ANY COMBINATION OF BALLOTS REPRESENTING CLAIMS OR EQUITY
INTERESTS IN THE SAME CLASS HELD BY THE SAME HOLDER BUT WHICH DOES NOT INDICATE
AN ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN OR WHICH INDICATES BOTH AN ACCEPTANCE AND
A REJECTION OF THE PLAN SHALL BE DEEMED AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN.

          The Debtors will publish the Confirmation Hearing Notice in the
national edition of The Wall Street Journal, the national edition of The USA
Today, Chicago Tribune and Indianapolis Star, which will contain the Plan
Objection Deadline and Confirmation Hearing, in order to provide notification to
persons who may not otherwise receive notice by mail.

For all Holders:

          By signing and returning a Ballot, each Holder of Claims and Equity
Interests in Classes 4A, 5A-1, 5A-2, 6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1, 4B-1, 4B-2, 5B, 6B
and 3C will also be certifying to the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtors that,
among other things:

          o such Holder has received and reviewed a copy of the Disclosure
          Statement and related Ballot and/or Master Ballot and acknowledges
          that the solicitation is being made pursuant to the terms and
          conditions set forth in the Plan;

          o such Holder has cast the same vote on every Ballot completed by such
          Holder with respect to holdings of such Class of Claims or Equity
          Interests;

                                      -95-
<PAGE>

          o no other Ballots with respect to such Class of Claims or Equity
          Interests have been cast or, if any other Ballots have been cast with
          respect to such Class of Claims or Equity Interests, such earlier
          Ballots are thereby revoked;

          o the Debtors have made available to such Holder or its agents all
          documents and information relating to the Plan and related matters
          reasonably requested by or on behalf of such Holder; and

          o except for information provided by the Debtors in writing, and by
          its own agents, such Holder has not relied on any statements made or
          other information received from any person with respect to the Plan.

          By signing and returning a Ballot, each Holder of Claims and Equity
Interests also acknowledges that the securities being distributed pursuant to
the Plan are not being distributed pursuant to a registration statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with any securities authority
outside of the United States and represents that any such securities will be
acquired for its own account and not with a view to any distribution of such
securities in violation of the Securities Act. It is expected that when issued
pursuant to the Plan, except with respect to entities deemed to be underwriters,
such securities will be exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act by virtue of section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code and may be
resold by the Holders thereof subject to the provisions of section 1145.

B.        VOTING TABULATION

          In tabulating votes, the following rules shall be used to determine
the claim amount associated with a creditor's vote:

          o If the Debtors do not object to a claim, the claim amount for voting
          purposes shall be the claim amount contained on a timely filed proof
          of claim or, if no proof of claim was filed, the non-contingent,
          liquidated and undisputed claim amount listed in the Debtors'
          schedules of liabilities.

          o If the Debtors object to a claim, such creditor's Ballot shall not
          be counted in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a), unless
          temporarily allowed by the Court for voting purposes, after notice and
          a hearing.

          o If a creditor believes that it should be entitled to vote on the
          Plan, then such creditor must serve on the Debtors and file with the
          Court a motion for an order pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a) (a
          "Rule 3018(a) Motion") seeking temporary allowance for voting
          purposes. Such Rule 3018(a) Motion, with evidence in support thereof,
          must be filed by May 6, 2003.

          o Ballots cast by creditors whose claims are not listed on the
          Debtors' schedules of liabilities, but who timely file proofs of claim
          in unliquidated or unknown amounts that are not the subject of an
          objection filed before the commencement of the Confirmation Hearing,
          will count for satisfying the numerosity requirement of section
          1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and will count as ballots for claims in
          the amount of $1.00 solely for the purpose of satisfying the dollar
          amount provisions of section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o In the case of publicly-held securities, the principal amount or
          number of shares according to the records of the transfer agent for
          the particular series of securities, including a further breakdown, in
          the case of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), of the individual
          nominee holders which are DTC participants, as of the Voting Record
          Date, shall be the claim or interest amount, except that in no event
          shall a Nominee holder be permitted to vote in excess of its position
          in DTC as of the Voting Record Date.

                                      -96-
<PAGE>


          The Claim amount or Equity Interest amount established through the
above process controls for voting purposes only and does not constitute the
Allowed amount of any Claim or Equity Interest for distribution purposes.

          To ensure that its vote is counted, each Holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest must (a) complete a Ballot; (b) indicate the Holder's decision either
to accept or reject the Plan in the boxes provided in the respective Ballot; and
(c) sign and return the Ballot to the address set forth on the envelope enclosed
therewith (if included).

          The Ballot does not constitute, and shall not be deemed to be, a Proof
of Claim or Equity Interest or an assertion or admission of a Claim or Equity
Interest.

          If a Holder holds Claims or Equity Interests in more than one Class
under the Plan, the Holder may receive more than one Ballot coded for each Class
of Claims or Equity Interests held by such Holder.

          Creditors shall not split their vote within a claim; thus, each
creditor shall be deemed to have voted the full amount of its claims or equity
interests within a particular class either to accept or reject the Plan.

          Except to the extent the Debtors so determine or as permitted by the
Bankruptcy Court, Ballots received after the Voting Deadline will not be
accepted or counted by the Debtors in connection with the Debtors' request for
confirmation of the Plan. The method of delivery of Ballots to be sent to the
Solicitation Agent is at the election and risk of each Holder of a Claim or
Equity Interest. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, such delivery will be
deemed made only when the original executed Ballot is actually received by the
Solicitation Agent. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to assure
timely delivery. Original executed Ballots or Master Ballots are required.
Delivery of a Ballot or Master Ballot by facsimile, e-mail or any other
electronic means will not be accepted. No Ballot or Master Ballot should be sent
to the Debtors, any indenture trustee, or the Debtors' financial or legal
advisors. The Debtors expressly reserve the right to amend, at any time and from
time to time, the terms of the Plan (subject to compliance with the requirements
of section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code). If the Debtors make material changes in
the terms of the Plan or if the Debtors waive a material condition, the Debtors
will disseminate additional solicitation materials and will extend the
solicitation, in each case to the extent directed by the Bankruptcy Court.

          If multiple Ballots or Master Ballots are received from or on behalf
of an individual Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest with respect to the same
claims or equity interests prior to the Voting Deadline, the last ballot timely
received will be deemed to reflect the voter's intent and to supersede and
revoke any prior ballot.

          If a Ballot or Master Ballot is signed by a trustee, executor,
administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation, or other
person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the authority and
capacity of such signatory to so act on behalf of a beneficial interest holder
shall be presumed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by executing a Ballot, such
signatory certifies that he or she has such authority and capacity, and shall
provide evidence of such authority and capacity upon request of the Solicitation
Agent or the Debtors.

          The Debtors, in their sole discretion, subject to contrary order of
the Bankruptcy Court, may waive any defect in any Ballot or Master Ballot at any
time, either before or after the close of voting, and without notice. Except as
otherwise provided herein, unless the Ballot or Master Ballot being furnished is
timely submitted on or prior to the Voting Deadline, the Debtors may, in their
sole discretion, reject such Ballot or Master Ballot as invalid and, therefore,
not count it in connection with confirmation of the Plan.

          In the event a designation is requested under section 1126(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code, any vote to accept or reject the Plan cast with respect to such
Claim or Equity Interest will not be counted for purposes of determining whether
the Plan has been accepted or rejected, unless the Bankruptcy Court orders
otherwise.

                                      -97-
<PAGE>


          Any holder of impaired claims or equity interests who has delivered a
valid Ballot voting on the Plan may withdraw such vote solely in accordance with
Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a).

          The Debtors' interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Plan
shall be final and binding on all parties, unless otherwise directed by the
Bankruptcy Court.

          Subject to any contrary order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors
reserve the absolute right to reject any and all Ballots and Master Ballots not
proper in form, the acceptance of which would, in the opinion of the Debtors or
their counsel, not be in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
Subject to any contrary order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors further
reserve the right to waive any defects or irregularities or conditions of
delivery as to any particular Ballot or Master Ballot unless otherwise directed
by the Bankruptcy Court. Neither the Debtors, nor any other person or entity,
will be under any duty to provide notification of defects or irregularities with
respect to deliveries of Ballots or Master Ballots nor will any of them incur
any liabilities for failure to provide such notification. Unless otherwise
directed by the Bankruptcy Court, delivery of such Ballots or Master Ballots
will not be deemed to have been made until such irregularities have been cured
or waived. Ballots and Master Ballots previously furnished (as to which any
irregularities have not theretofor been cured or waived) will not be counted.

C.        VOTING PROCEDURES

          The Voting Record Date for purposes of determining which Holders of
Claims and Equity Interests are entitled to vote on the Plan is March 19, 2003.

          1.   Beneficial Holders

          Any Beneficial Holder of Claims and Equity Interests holding as a
record holder in its own name, shall vote on the Plan by completing and signing
the Ballot and returning it to the Solicitation Agent.

          Any Beneficial Holder of Claims and Equity Interests who holds in
"street name" through a Nominee shall vote on the Plan either (i) if the Nominee
has provided a prevalidated Ballot, by completing and signing the prevalidated
Ballot and returning it directly to the Solicitation Agent or (ii) by promptly
completing and signing the Ballot and returning it to the Nominee in sufficient
time to allow the Nominee to process the Ballot and return a Master Ballot to
the Solicitation Agent by the Voting Deadline.

          Any Ballot returned to a Nominee by a Beneficial Holder will not be
counted for purposes of accepting or rejecting the Plan until such Nominee
properly completes and timely delivers to the Solicitation Agent a Master Ballot
that reflects the vote of such Beneficial Holder.

          2.   Nominees

          Because of the complexity and difficulty associated with reaching
beneficial owners of publicly traded securities, many of which hold their
securities in brokerage accounts and through several layers of ownership, the
Debtors are distributing a Ballot (a) to each record holder of Claims or Equity
Interests derived from or based on publicly traded securities (collectively, the
"Beneficial Holders Claims") as of the Voting Record Date (as discussed in
Section VII.C.1 above) and (b) an appropriate number of copies to each bank or
brokerage firm (or the agent or other Nominee therefor) identified by the
Solicitation Agent as an entity through which beneficial owners hold the
Beneficial Holders Claims. Each Nominee will be requested to immediately
distribute a copy of this Disclosure Statement and accompanying materials
including the Ballots to all Beneficial Holders for which it holds the
Beneficial Holders Claims. Each Nominee must summarize the individual votes of
its respective individual Beneficial Holders from their individual Beneficial
Holders' Ballots on a Master Ballot and shall return such Master Ballot to the
Solicitation Agent. These procedures will enable the Debtors to transmit
materials to the Holders of its publicly traded securities and afford Beneficial
Holders of the Beneficial Holders Claims a fair and reasonable opportunity to
vote. In order for votes to be counted, all Ballots and Master Ballots received
from the Debtors must be returned to the Solicitation Agent by the Voting
Deadline as indicated on the Ballots.

                                      -98-
<PAGE>


          A Nominee may also pre-validate a Ballot for Holders of the Beneficial
Holders Claims by completing all the information to be entered on the Ballot
(the "Pre-Validated Ballot") and forwarding the Pre-Validated Ballot to the
Beneficial Holder for voting. The Ballot may then be delivered directly to the
Solicitation Agent in the return envelope provided with the Ballot.

          If a Beneficial Holder holds the Beneficial Holders Claims through
more than one Nominee, such Beneficial Holder should execute a separate Ballot
for each block of Beneficial Holders Claims that it holds through any Nominee
and (unless the ballot was "prevalidated") return the Ballot to the respective
Nominee that holds the Beneficial Holders Claims.

          If a Beneficial Holder holds a portion of its Beneficial Holders
Claims through a Nominee and another portion directly or in its own name as the
record holder, such Beneficial Holder should follow the procedures described in
Section VII.C.1 above to vote the portion held in its own name and the
procedures described in Section VII.C.2 above to vote the portion held by the
Nominee or Nominees.

          3.   Solicitation of Trust Related Claims

          Within five (5) business days after the Voting Record Date, State
Street Bank and Trust Co. ("State Street Bank"), the indenture trustee for the
Trust Preferred Securities, will provide the Solicitation Agent, the Debtors and
the TOPrS Committee: (i) a copy of the list of names, addresses and holdings of
the record holders of the Trust Preferred Securities (the "Trust Preferred
Securities Record Holders"), as of the Voting Record Date; (ii) a set of mailing
labels for the Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders; and (iii) such other
information as the Solicitation Agent deems reasonably necessary to perform its
duties as solicitation agent for the Debtors. The Solicitation Agent will use
these lists, mailing labels and other information only for purposes of
performing its duties as solicitation agent for the Debtors.

          Within three (3) days after the Voting Record Date, State Street Bank
will provide written authorization to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, or other
similar entities (each, a "Depository"), to release to the Solicitation Agent
the name of any and all institutional holders of record of the Trust Preferred
Securities who hold the Trust Preferred Securities in "street name" on behalf of
the beneficial holders of the Trust Preferred Securities (the "Trust Preferred
Securities Beneficial Holders"). The written authorization will be in a form
acceptable to the Solicitation Agent and will advise the Depository that the
written request has been authorized by order of the Bankruptcy Court.

          Within five (5) business days after receipt of the list of the Trust
Preferred Securities Record Holders from State Street Bank, or any Depository,
the Solicitation Agent will cause to be mailed by first class mail to each Trust
Preferred Securities Record Holder (i) a copy of the Order and (ii) the
Solicitation Package in sufficient numbers estimated to allow dissemination of
the Solicitation Packages by the Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders to
each of the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders for which it serves,
with instructions to each such Trust Preferred Securities Record Holder to (a)
contact the Solicitation Agent for additional sets of Solicitation Packages, if
necessary, and (b) promptly, within five (5) business days after receipt of the
Solicitation Packages, distribute by sending first-class mail, postage prepaid,
the Solicitation Packages to the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders
for which it serves.

          The Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders will pre-validate the
Ballots to be forwarded to the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders for
which it serves by including thereon the amount of the Trust Preferred
Securities held by the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holder and the
appropriate account number through which the Trust Preferred Securities
Beneficial Holders' holdings are held.

          The Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders are authorized and
directed to follow one of the following two options to obtain the votes of the
Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders:

          (1) Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders may forward the
Solicitation Package to the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders for
voting, which will include a Pre-Validated Ballot and a return envelope provided
by, and addressed to, the Trust Preferred Securities Record Holder. Under this
option, the Trust Preferred Securities Record Holder must summarize the
individual votes of their Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders from the
Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders' Pre-

                                      -99-
<PAGE>

Validated Ballots on a Master Ballot. The Trust Preferred Securities Record
Holders will then return the Master Ballot to the Solicitation Agent so that it
is actually received by the Solicitation Agent on or before the Voting Deadline;

          or

          (2) The Trust Preferred Securities Record Holders will forward the
Solicitation Package, including a Pre-Validated Ballot, to the Trust Preferred
Securities Beneficial Holders for which it serves for voting, along with a
return envelope addressed to the Solicitation Agent. Under this option, the
Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders must complete and return the
Pre-Validated Ballot directly to the Solicitation Agent so that it is actually
received by the Solicitation Agent on or before the Voting Deadline.

          Each Trust Preferred Securities Record Holder will maintain a list of
those Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders, as of the Voting Record
Date, to whom Pre-Validated Ballots were sent for one (1) year following the
Voting Deadline, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.

          Each Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holder, as of the Voting
Record Date, is entitled to one (1) vote on account of its holdings of Trust
Preferred Securities.

          Upon written request made within five (5) business days of receipt of
the Solicitation Packages from the Solicitation Agent, a Trust Preferred
Securities Record Holder may opt out of these Trust Preferred Securities
Procedures by mailing, first-class mail, postage prepaid, a complete list of
names, addresses and holdings of each Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial
Holder for which it represents to the Solicitation Agent. In the event a Trust
Preferred Securities Record Holder properly opts-out of the Trust Preferred
Securities Procedures, the Solicitation Agent shall be responsible for directly
soliciting and tabulating the vote of the Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial
Holders identified by such Trust Preferred Securities Record Holder.

          Notwithstanding any indenture, declaration of trust, or other document
executed in connection with the Trust Preferred Securities or Subordinated
Debentures, Trust Preferred Securities Beneficial Holders, as of the Voting
Record Date, will be entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan on behalf of
the Subordinated Debenture Claims in the same dollar amounts as they hold Trust
Preferred Securities.

          State Street Bank is not obligated to and shall not vote on the Plan,
and has by order of the Bankruptcy Court been relieved from such obligation, if
any.

          The Debtors are authorized to reimburse any Nominee and Trust
Preferred Securities Record Holder, and any of their agents, only for their
reasonable, actual and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing
the tasks described above (subject to the Bankruptcy Court retaining
jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over any request for reimbursement).

D.        THE CONFIRMATION HEARING

          Section 1128(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires the Bankruptcy Court,
after notice, to hold a hearing on confirmation of the Plan (the "Confirmation
Hearing"). Section 1128(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that any
party-in-interest may object to confirmation of the Plan.

          The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled the Confirmation Hearing for May
28, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. before the Honorable Carol A. Doyle, United States
Bankruptcy Judge, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, located at the Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, 219 S.
Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60604. The Confirmation Hearing may be adjourned
from time to time by the Bankruptcy Court without further notice except for an
announcement of the adjourned date made at the Confirmation Hearing or any
adjournment thereof.

          Objections to confirmation of the Plan must be filed and served on or
before May 14, 2003 in accordance with the Confirmation Hearing Notice
accompanying this Disclosure Statement. UNLESS OBJECTIONS TO CONFIRMATION ARE
TIMELY SERVED AND FILED IN COMPLIANCE

                                     -100-
<PAGE>

WITH THE APPROVAL ORDER, THEY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

E.        STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

          At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court shall determine
whether the requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Court have been
satisfied. If so, the Bankruptcy Court shall enter the Confirmation Order. The
Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies or will satisfy the applicable
requirements, as follows:

          o The Plan complies with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
          Code.

          o The Debtors, as Plan proponent, will have complied with the
          applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o The Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means
          forbidden by law.

          o Any payment made or promised under the Plan for services or for
          costs and expenses in, or in connection with, this Bankruptcy Case, or
          in connection with the Plan and incident to the case, has been
          disclosed to the Bankruptcy Court, and any such payment made before
          the confirmation of the Plan is reasonable, or if such payment is to
          be fixed after the confirmation of the Plan, such payment is subject
          to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court as reasonable.

          o With respect to each Class of Impaired Claims or Equity Interests,
          either each Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest of such Class has
          accepted the Plan, or will receive or retain under the Plan on account
          of such Claim or Equity Interest, property of a value, as of the
          Effective Date of the Plan, that is not less than the amount that such
          Holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated on such
          date under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o Each Class of Claims or Equity Interests that is entitled to vote on
          the Plan has either accepted the Plan or is not impaired under the
          Plan, or the Plan can be confirmed without the approval of each voting
          Class pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o Except to the extent that the Holder of a particular Claim will
          agree to a different treatment of such Claim, the Plan provides that
          Allowed Administrative, Allowed Priority Tax Claims and Allowed Other
          Priority Claims will be paid in full on the Effective Date, or as soon
          thereafter as practicable.

          o At least one Class of Impaired Claims or Equity Interests will
          accept the Plan, determined without including any acceptance of the
          Plan by any insider holding a Claim of such Class.

          o Confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the
          liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the
          Debtors or any successor to the Debtors under the Plan, unless such
          liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the Plan.

          o All fees of the type described in 28 U.S.C.ss. 1930, including the
          fees of the United States Trustee, will be paid as of the Effective
          Date.

          o The Plan addresses payment of retiree benefits in accordance with
          Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          The Debtors believe that (a) the Plan satisfies or will satisfy all of
the statutory requirements of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) they have
complied or will have complied with all of the requirements of Chapter 11 and
(c) the Plan has been proposed in good faith.

          1.   Best Interests of Creditors Test/Liquidation Analysis

          Before the Plan may be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Court must find (with
certain exceptions) that the Plan provides, with respect to each Class, that
each Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest in such Class either (a) has accepted
the Plan or (b) will receive or retain under the Plan property of a value, as of
the Effective Date, that is not less than the amount that such person would
receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

          In chapter 7 liquidation cases, unsecured creditors and interest
holders of a debtor are paid from available assets generally in the following
order, with no lower Class receiving any payments until all amounts due to
senior Classes have been paid fully or payment provided for:

          o Secured creditors (to the extent of the value of their collateral).

          o Priority creditors.

          o Unsecured creditors.

          o Debt expressly subordinated by its terms or by order of the
          Bankruptcy Court.

          o Equity Interest Holders.

               (a)     Liquidation Analysis of CNC and CIHC

          As described in more detail in the Liquidation Analysis set forth on
Exhibit B attached hereto, the Debtors believe that the value of any
distributions in a chapter 7 case would be less than the value of distributions
under the Plan because, among other reasons, such distributions in a chapter 7
case may not occur for a longer period of time thereby reducing the present
value of such distributions. In this regard, it is possible that distribution of
the proceeds of a liquidation could be delayed for a period in order for a
chapter 7 trustee and its professionals to become knowledgeable about the
Bankruptcy Case and the Claims against the Debtors. In addition, proceeds
received in a chapter 7 liquidation are likely to be significantly discounted
due to the distressed nature of the sale, and the fees and expenses of a chapter
7 trustee would likely exceed those of the Estate Representative (thereby
further reducing Cash available for distribution).

               (b)     Liquidation Analysis of PHG and CTIHC

          PHG and CTIHC believe that the value of any distributions in a chapter
7 case would be less than the value of distributions under their respective
Subplans.

          On January 2, 2003, PHG filed its schedules and statement of financial
affairs. In those documents, PHG disclosed that it has no assets, and $105,955
of unsecured liabilities owed to CIHC. PHG's Subplan provides that CIHC will
receive no distribution on account of this claim, and CIHC has consented to this
treatment.

          On January 2, 2003, CTIHC filed its schedules and statement of
financial affairs. In those documents, CTIHC discloses that it has liquid assets
of $2,607, an intercompany claim of unknown value and potential causes of
action. CTIHC's liabilities are unknown at this time. CTIHC's Subplan proposes
that if an unsecured claim is allowed against CTIHC, then such creditor will
receive the stock of CTIHC.

          PHG's and CTIHC's schedules are available at www.bmccorp.net/conseco
or by contacting the Debtors' notice agent at 1-888-909-0100.

          2.   Financial Feasibility

          The Bankruptcy Code requires the Bankruptcy Court to find, as a
condition to confirmation, that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the
liquidation of Debtors or the need for further financial reorganization, unless
such liquidation is contemplated by the Plan. For purposes of showing that the
Plan

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

meets this feasibility standard, the Debtors, together with Lazard, have
analyzed (taking into account the Company's Projections) the ability of the
Reorganized Debtors to meet its obligations under the Plan and to retain
sufficient liquidity and capital resources to conduct its businesses.

          The Debtors believe that with a significantly deleveraged capital
structure, the Company's business will be able to return to viability. The
decrease in the amount of debt on the Company's balance sheet will substantially
reduce its interest expense, improving its cash flow. Based on the terms of the
Plan, at emergence the Company will have $1.4 billion of debt in contrast to
more than $6.4 billion of debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations prior
to the restructuring.

          The Projections indicate that the Company should have sufficient cash
flow to pay and service its debt obligations and to fund its operations.
Accordingly, the Debtors believe that the Plan complies with the financial
feasibility standard of section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          3.   Acceptance by Impaired Classes

          The Bankruptcy Code requires, as a condition to confirmation, that
each Class of Claims or Equity Interests that is impaired under the Plan accept
the Plan, with the exception described in the following section. A Class that is
not "impaired" under a plan of reorganization is deemed to have accepted the
plan and, therefore, solicitation of acceptances with respect to such Class is
not required. A Class is "impaired" unless the plan (a) leaves unaltered the
legal, equitable and contractual rights to which the Claim or Equity Interest
entitles the Holder of such Claim or Equity Interest or (b) cures any default
and reinstates the original terms of the obligation.

          4.   Confirmation Without Acceptance by All Impaired Classes

          Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code allows a Bankruptcy Court to
confirm a plan, even if such plan has not been accepted by all Impaired Classes
entitled to vote on such plan, provided that such plan has been accepted by at
least one Impaired Class.

          Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code states that notwithstanding the
failure of an Impaired Class to accept a plan of reorganization, the plan shall
be confirmed, on request of the proponent of the plan, in a procedure commonly
known as "cram-down," so long as the plan does not "discriminate unfairly," and
is "fair and equitable" with respect to each Class of Claims or Equity Interests
that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

          In general, a plan does not discriminate unfairly if it provides a
treatment to the class that is substantially equivalent to the treatment that is
provided to other classes that have equal rank. In determining whether a plan
discriminates unfairly, courts will take into account a number of factors,
including the effect of applicable subordination agreements between parties.
Accordingly, two classes of unsecured creditors could be treated differently
without unfairly discriminating against either class.

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of secured claims includes the requirements that (a) the
Holders of such secured claims retain the liens securing such Claims to the
extent of the allowed amount of the Claims, whether the property subject to the
liens is retained by debtor or transferred to another entity under the plan and
(b) each Holder of a secured claim in the Class receives deferred Cash payments
totaling at least the allowed amount of such Claim with a present value, as of
the effective date of the plan, at least equivalent to the value of the secured
claimant's interest in the debtor's property subject to the liens.

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of unsecured claims includes the following requirement that
either: (a) the plan provides that each Holder of a Claim of such Class receive
or retain on account of such Claim property of a value, as of the effective date
of the plan, equal to the allowed amount of such Claim; or (b) the Holder of any
Claim or Equity Interest that is junior to the Claims of such Class will not
receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior Claim or Equity
Interest any property.

                                    -103-
<PAGE>

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of Equity Interests includes the requirements that either:
(a) the plan provide that each Holder of an Equity Interest in such Class
receive or retain under the plan, on account of such Equity Interest, property
of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the greater of (i)
the allowed amount of any fixed liquidation preference to which such Holder is
entitled, (ii) any fixed redemption price to which such Holder is entitled or
(iii) the value of such interest; or (b) if the Class does not receive such an
amount as required under (a), no Class of Equity Interests junior to the
non-accepting Class may receive a distribution under the plan.

                                     VIII.
                                  RISK FACTORS

HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS SHOULD READ AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE
FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, AS WELL AS THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TOGETHER HEREWITH, REFERRED TO
OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN, PRIOR TO VOTING TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE
PLAN. THESE FACTORS SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING THE ONLY
RISKS INVOLVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

A.        CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY CONSIDERATIONS

The Bankruptcy Filing May Further Disrupt Our Operations and the Operations of
Our Subsidiaries.

          The impact that the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our operations and
the operations of our subsidiaries cannot be accurately predicted or quantified.
Since the announcement of our intention to seek a restructuring of our capital
in August 2002 and the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have suffered
significant disruptions in our operations. Our leveraged condition and liquidity
difficulties have eliminated CFC's access to the securitization markets, which
have historically served as CFC's main source of funding. As a result, CFC has
had to terminate the origination of loans which it is unable to sell profitably
in the whole-loan market. In addition, insurance regulators in each of the
states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have been monitoring
the Company's activities associated with its financial restructuring. Our two
insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas each entered into consent orders with
the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas, which, among other things,
has limited their ability to pay dividends without regulatory approval and to
make disbursements other than in the ordinary course of business. In August
2002, A.M. Best further downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B (fair)." These ratings downgrades and other adverse
publicity concerning the Company's financial condition have caused sales of our
insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase. In some cases, we have experienced defections among our sales force of
agents and/or have increased commissions in order to retain them.

          The continuation of the Chapter 11 Cases, particularly if the Plan is
not approved or confirmed in the time frame currently contemplated, could
further adversely affect our operations and relationship with our customers,
employees, regulators, distributors and agents. If confirmation and consummation
of the Plan do not occur expeditiously, the Chapter 11 Cases could result in,
among other things, increased costs for professional fees and similar expenses.
In addition, prolonged Chapter 11 Cases may make it more difficult to retain and
attract management and other key personnel and would require senior management
to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with our financial
reorganization instead of focusing on the operation of our business.

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Confirmation of the Plan.

         We cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite acceptances to
confirm the Plan. Even if we receive the requisite acceptances, we cannot assure
you that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan. A non-accepting creditor or
equity holder might challenge the adequacy of this Disclosure Statement or the
balloting procedures and results as not being in compliance with the Bankruptcy
Code or Bankruptcy Rules. Even if the Bankruptcy Court determined that the
Disclosure Statement and the balloting

                                     -104-
<PAGE>

procedures and results were appropriate, the Bankruptcy Court could still
decline to confirm the Plan if it found that any of the statutory requirements
for confirmation had not been met, including that the terms of the Plan are fair
and equitable to non-accepting Classes. Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code sets
forth the requirements for confirmation and requires, among other things, (i) a
finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the Plan "does not unfairly discriminate"
and is "fair and equitable" with respect to any non-accepting Classes, (ii)
confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by a liquidation or a need
for further financial reorganization and (iii) the value of distributions to
non-accepting Holders of claims and interests within a particular Class under
the Plan will not be less than the value of distributions such Holders would
receive if the Company were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.
While there can be no assurance that these requirements will be met, we believe
that the Plan will not be followed by a need for further financial
reorganization and that non-accepting Holders within each Class under the Plan
will receive distributions at least as great as would be received following a
liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code when taking into
consideration all administrative claims and costs associated with any such
chapter 7 case. We believe that Holders of Equity Interests in Conseco would
receive no distribution under either a liquidation pursuant to chapter 7 or
chapter 11.

          The confirmation and consummation of the Plan are also subject to
certain conditions described in Section VI.L above. If the Plan is not
confirmed, it is unclear whether a restructuring of Conseco could be implemented
and what distributions Holders of Claims or Equity Interests ultimately would
receive with respect to their Claims or Equity Interests. If an alternative
reorganization could not be agreed to, it is possible that we would have to
liquidate our assets, in which case it is likely that Holders of Claims and
Equity Interests would receive substantially less favorable treatment than they
would receive under the Plan.

The Bankruptcy Court May Not Subordinate Certain Litigation Under Section 510(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code.

          As described in Section VI.G above, eight purported securities fraud
class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana. The Debtors will seek to subordinate the
claims related to these lawsuits under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. If
these claims are not subordinated, then they would be treated as General
Unsecured Claims.

          As described in Section VI.G above, in October 2002, Roderick Russell,
on behalf of himself and a class of persons similarly situated, and on behalf of
the ConsecoSavePlan, filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana against CNC, Conseco Services and certain current
and former officers of CNC (Roderick Russell, et al. v Conseco, Inc., et al.,
Case No. I :02-CV -1639 LJM). The purported class action consists of all
individuals whose 401(k) accounts held common stock of CNC at any time from
April 28, 1999 through the present. The Debtors will seek to subordinate the
claims related to this lawsuit under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. If
these claims are not subordinated, then they would be treated as General
Unsecured Claims.

Our Valuation of New CNC May Not be Adopted by the Bankruptcy Court.

          The Debtors believe based on, among other things, the valuation
included herein, that the approximate midpoint enterprise value of New CNC is
$3.8 billion. This is significantly less than the value that would be required
to provide a recovery to the holders of Trust Preferred Securities or the equity
securities of CNC. The holders of the Trust Preferred Securities and the holders
of equity securities of CNC, among others, may oppose confirmation of the Plan
alleging that value of New CNC is higher than $3.8 billion and that the Plan
thereby improperly extinguishes their rights to recoveries under the Plan. At
the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will hear evidence regarding the
views of the Debtors and opposing parties (if any) with respect to the valuation
of New CNC. Based on that evidence, the Bankruptcy Court will determine the
appropriate valuation for New CNC for purposes of the Plan. The Debtors believe
that $3.8 billion is the appropriate valuation. We cannot, however, assure you
that the Bankruptcy Court will adopt our valuation of New CNC.

General Unsecured Claims Against CNC or CIHC May Be Diluted.

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

          Under the Subplans, the Debtors propose to distribute all or
substantially all of the New CNC Common Stock to Holders of Original Note
Claims, Exchange Note Claims and Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.
Disputed litigation claims, however, may materially impact the amount of General
Unsecured Claims against CNC and CIHC. In addition, there may be other Claims
asserted by unknown parties. If such Claims are Allowed, they will dilute the
percentage of shares distributed to Holders of Original Note Claims, Exchange
Note Claims and Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

          To date, the Debtors have received over 9,000 proofs of claim. The
face value of the claims filed as general unsecured claims, excluding Class 5A,
6A, 7A, 10A, 4B, and 5B Claims, are $2,218,678,451 with respect to CNC and
$2,086,487,548 with respect to CIHC. The bar date for all creditors (other than
certain D&O loan participants and the Finance Company Debtors) to file claims
against the Reorganizing Debtors was February 21, 2003. See Section V.A.8 above.
The Debtors are reviewing and assessing these claims, many of which appear to be
duplicates, filed against the wrong entities, and/or claims of shareholders that
may be subordinated under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors
will file appropriate objections in due course and attempt to reduce the total
amount of General Unsecured Claims but there can be no assurance that the
Debtors will be able to do so, particularly in light of the amount of the claims
asserted to date.

          On February 19, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order granting
the Finance Company Debtors through April 1, 2003 to file proofs of claim
against the Reorganizing Debtors. The Finance Company Debtors are presently
engaged in investigations to determine the bases for, and valuation of,
intercompany claims they may hold against the Reorganizing Debtors. It is
possible that the investigations conducted by the Finance Company Debtors will
yield additional information regarding the intercompany obligations which may
necessitate adjustments to the amounts of the PrePetition Note Balance, the
Advanced Funds, Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims and/or Net Reorganizing
Debtors' Claims. We cannot assure you that these adjustments will not materially
reduce the recoveries of Holders of Claims against the Reorganizing Debtors. Nor
can we assure you whether the Noteholder Subcommittee and/or the Lender
Subcommittee will waive the conditions to confirmation and consummation as they
relate to the CIHC General Unsecured Claims Cap.

Parties in Interest May Object to Our Classification of Claims.

          Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan of
reorganization may place a class or an interest in a particular class only if
such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other claims or interests
in such class. We believe that the classification of claims and interests under
the Plan complies with the requirements set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.
However, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same
conclusion.

We May Object to the Amount or Classification of a Claim.

          We reserve the right to object to the amount or classification of any
Claim or Equity Interest. The estimates set forth in this Disclosure Statement
cannot be relied on by any creditor or equityholder whose Claim or Equity
Interest is subject to an objection. Any such Holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest may not receive its specified share of the estimated distributions
described in this Disclosure Statement.

B.        FACTORS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE
          PLAN

We May Not Be Able to Achieve Our Projected Financial Results.

          We may not be able to meet our projected financial results or achieve
the revenue or cash flow that we have assumed in projecting our future business
prospects. If we do not achieve these projected revenue or cash flow levels, we
may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned after the
Effective Date. Our financial projections represent management's view based on
currently known facts and hypothetical assumptions about our future operations.
However, the Projections set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto do not guarantee
our future financial performance.

                                     -106-

The Plan Exchanges Senior Securities for Junior Securities.

          If the Plan is confirmed and consummated, holders of Original Notes
and Exchange Notes will, and holders of 93/94 Notes may, receive shares of New
CNC Common Stock, and the Lenders will receive shares of New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants. Thus, in agreeing to the Plan, the Lenders and holders of
Original Notes and Exchange Notes will be consenting to the exchange of their
interests in senior debt, which has a stated interest rate, a maturity date, a
liquidation preference over equity securities and, in the case of the Lenders
and holders of the Exchange Notes, a guaranty, for shares of New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Warrants or New CNC Common Stock, as applicable, which will be
subordinate to all creditor claims, and, in the case of New CNC Common Stock and
New CNC Warrants, the claims of holders of New CNC Preferred Stock.

A Liquid Trading Market for the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock
and New CNC Warrants May Not Develop.

          Although the Company intends to apply to list the New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants on a national securities
exchange or NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
listings or, even if we do, that liquid trading markets for the New CNC
Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants will develop. The
liquidity of any market for the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock
and New CNC Warrants will depend, among other things, upon the number of Holders
of New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants, our
financial performance, and the market for similar securities, none of which can
be determined or predicted. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active
trading market will develop or, if a market develops, what the liquidity or
pricing characteristics of that market will be.

The Trading Price For the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New
CNC Warrants May Be Depressed Following the Effective Date.

          Assuming consummation of the Plan, the New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants will be issued substantially
simultaneously to Holders of Claims and Equity Interests who had originally
purchased other securities of the Company or who purchased such securities
before the need for the financial restructuring of the Company became manifest.
Following the Effective Date, such Holders may seek to dispose of the New CNC
Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants in an effort to
obtain liquidity, which could cause the initial trading prices for these
securities to be depressed, particularly in light of the lack of established
trading markets for these securities.

The Estimated Valuation of New CNC and the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC
Common Stock, and the Estimated Recoveries to Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests, is Not Intended to Represent the Trading Values of the New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Common Stock.

          The estimated valuation of the Company set forth in Section II.J
above, prepared by Lazard at the request of the Company and based on the
Projections developed by the Company's management, is based on certain generally
accepted valuation analyses and is not intended to represent the trading values
of New CNC's securities in public or private markets. This valuation analysis is
based on numerous assumptions (the realization of many of which is beyond our
control), including, among other things, our successful reorganization, an
assumed Effective Date of June 1, 2003, our ability to achieve the operating and
financial results included in the Projections, our ability to maintain adequate
liquidity to fund operations and the assumption that capital and equity markets
remain consistent with current conditions. Even if we achieve the Projections,
the trading market values for the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Common
Stock could be adversely impacted by the lack of trading liquidity for these
securities, the lack of institutional research coverage and concentrated selling
by recipients of these securities.

The Trading Price of the New CNC Common Stock May be Adversely Affected by
Potential Dilution Caused by the New CNC Preferred Stock, the New CNC Warrants
and the Equity Incentive Plan.

                                     -107-
<PAGE>

          In addition to the New CNC Common Stock, as of the Effective Date,
there will be issued New CNC Preferred Stock (which will be exchangeable or
convertible into shares of New CNC Common Stock in the future), New CNC Warrants
to purchase 5% of the New CNC Common Stock and equity awards of up to 10% of the
issued and outstanding New CNC Common Stock as of the Effective Date on a fully
diluted basis under the equity incentive plan. On and after 10 years from the
Effective Date, the New CNC Preferred Stock will be exchangeable into shares of
New CNC Common Stock based on the fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock
on the date of exchange. On and after September 30, 2005, the New CNC Preferred
Stock will be convertible into shares of New CNC Common Stock at a conversion
price, to be measured on the 120th day following the Effective Date, equal to
the average of the volume weighted average prices of the New CNC Common Stock
for the immediately preceding 60 days. The potential dilution of the New CNC
Common Stock from the conversion or exchange of the New CNC Preferred Stock, the
exercise of the New CNC Warrants and the exercise of options under the equity
incentive plan may cause the market price of the New CNC Common Stock to trade
significantly below the level that it otherwise would.

Certain Holders of New CNC Common Stock May Hold Substantial Interests in New
CNC, Including Interests in Excess of 5%.

          During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, there is no limitation on
the trading of Claims. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Plan, certain
Holders of Claims may receive distributions of New CNC Common Stock representing
a substantial amount of the outstanding shares of New CNC Common Stock. If
Holders of significant numbers of shares of New CNC Common Stock were to act as
a group, such Holders could be in a position to control the outcome of actions
requiring stockholder approval, including, among other things, election of
directors. This concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a
negotiated change of control of the Company and, consequently, impact the value
of the New CNC Common Stock.

          Further, the possibility that one or more Holders of significant
numbers of shares of New CNC Common Stock may determine to sell all or a large
portion of their shares of New CNC Common Stock in a short period of time may
adversely affect the market price of the New CNC Common Stock.

New CNC's Certificate of Incorporation Imposes Restrictions on the Voting Power
of Significant Stockholders.

          In the event that any Person or group of affiliated Persons obtains
direct or indirect beneficial ownership of shares of capital stock of New CNC
providing such Person(s) in excess of 10% of the voting power with respect to a
particular stockholder vote, such Person(s) will be entitled to vote only such
number of shares of capital stock as do not in the aggregate equal or exceed 10%
of the voting power with respect to that stockholder vote, unless, prior to that
stockholder vote, the acquisition, ownership and voting of such shares of
capital stock by such Person(s) in excess of 10% has been approved, or exempted
from approval, pursuant to all applicable insurance regulatory requirements. See
Section II.G, "Terms of New Securities and New Bank Debt to be Issued Pursuant
to the Plan."

The New CNC Common Stock Will Be Issued in Odd Lots.

          Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests may receive odd
lot distributions (less than 100 shares) of New CNC Common Stock. Holders may
find it more difficult to dispose of odd lots in the marketplace and may face
increased brokerage charges in connection with any such disposition.

We Do Not Expect to Pay Cash Dividends on the New CNC Preferred Stock and New
CNC Common Stock For the Foreseeable Future.

          The terms of the New Credit Facility will limit, among other things,
New CNC's ability to pay dividends, and it is not anticipated that any cash
dividends will be paid on the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Common Stock
in the near future. See Section II.G, "Terms of New Securities and New Bank Debt
to be Issued Pursuant to the Plan."

Certain Tax Consequences of the Plan Raise Unsettled and Complex Legal Issues
and Involve Various Factual Determinations.

          Some of the material consequences of the Plan regarding United States
federal income taxes are summarized in Article IX hereof. Many of these tax
issues raise unsettled and complex legal issues, and also involve various
factual determinations, such as valuations, that raise additional uncertainties.
We cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a contrary view, and no ruling
from the IRS has been or will be sought regarding the tax consequences described
herein. In addition, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge the
various positions we have taken, or intend to take, with respect to our tax
treatment, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. FOR A MORE
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATING TO THE SPECIFIC POSITIONS WE INTEND TO
TAKE WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS TAX ISSUES, PLEASE REVIEW ARTICLE IX.

C.        RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our Degree of Leverage May Limit Our Financial and Operating Activities.

          We will have significant indebtedness even after the Plan is
consummated. Further, our historical capital requirements have been significant
and our future capital requirements could vary significantly and may be affected
by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance, and many other
factors that are not within our control. Recently, we have had difficulty
financing our operations due, in part, to our significant losses and leveraged
condition, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing in
the future. Even if the Plan is approved and consummated, we cannot assure you
that we will not experience losses. Our profitability and ability to generate
cash flow will likely depend upon our ability to successfully implement our
business strategy and meet or exceed the results forecasted in the projections.
However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish these results.

A Failure to Improve and Maintain the Financial Strength Ratings of Our
Insurance Subsidiaries Could Negatively Impact Our Operations and Financial
Results.

          An important competitive factor for our insurance subsidiaries is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. See
"Description of Conseco's Business - The Company's Business - Competition." In
July 2002, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings of Conseco's
primary insurance subsidiaries to "B++ (Very Good)" and placed the ratings
"under review with negative implications." On August 14, 2002, A.M. Best further
lowered the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries
from "B++ (very good)" to "B (fair)". The A.M. Best downgrades caused sales of
our insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase. In some cases, the downgrades also caused defections among our
independent agent sales force and increases in the commissions we must pay.
These events have had a material adverse effect on our operations, financial
results and liquidity.

          Although we currently expect our insurance subsidiaries to achieve a
category "A" rating by the end of 2004, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to achieve or maintain this rating. If we fail to achieve and maintain a
category "A" rating, sales of our insurance products could continue to fall and
additional existing policyholders may redeem or lapse their policies, adversely
affecting our future operations, financial results and liquidity.

The Covenants in the New Credit Facility Restrict Our Activities and Require Us
to Meet or Maintain Various Financial Ratios and Minimum Insurance Ratings.

          In connection with our reorganization, we will enter into the New
Credit Facility with our lenders. We have agreed to a number of covenants and
other provisions that restrict our ability to engage in various financing
transactions and pursue certain operating activities without the prior consent
of the lenders under the New Credit Facility. We have also agreed to meet or
maintain various financial ratios and minimum financial strength ratings for our
insurance subsidiaries. For instance, if we experience a ratings downgrade
following confirmation of the Plan, if we fail to achieve an "A-" rating by a
specified date following confirmation of the Plan or if we experience a ratings
downgrade after achieving an "A-" rating, we will

                                     -109-

<PAGE>

suffer an event of default under the New Credit Facility. Our ability to meet
these financial and ratings covenants may be affected by events beyond our
control. Although we expect to be in compliance with these requirements as of
the Effective Date, these requirements represent significant restrictions on the
manner in which we may operate our business. If we default under any of these
requirements, the lenders could declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued
interest and fees to be due and payable. If that were to occur, we cannot assure
you that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance this
indebtedness or any of our other debts.


CNC and CIHC are Holding Companies and Depend on their Subsidiaries for Cash.

          CNC and CIHC are holding companies with no business operations of
their own; they depend on their operating subsidiaries for cash to make
principal and interest payments on debt, and to pay administrative expenses and
income taxes. The cash CNC and CIHC receive from insurance subsidiaries consists
of fees for services, tax sharing payments, dividends and distributions, and
from our non-insurance subsidiaries, loans and advances. A deterioration in the
financial condition, earnings or cash flow of the material subsidiaries of CNC
or CIHC for any reason could limit such subsidiaries' ability to pay cash
dividends or other disbursements to CNC and/or CIHC, which, in turn, would limit
CNC's and/or CIHC's ability to meet debt service requirements and satisfy other
financial obligations.

          The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject
to state insurance department regulations. These regulations generally permit
dividends to be paid from earned surplus of the insurance company for any
12-month period in amounts equal to the greater of (or in a few states, the
lesser of): (i) net gain from operations for the prior year; or (ii) 10% of
surplus as of the end of the preceding year. Any dividends in excess of these
levels require the approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable
state insurance department. As described in "Events Leading to The Chapter 11
Case and Related Post-Petition Events - Insurance Ratings and Regulatory
Issues," Bankers National Life Insurance Company and Conseco Life Insurance
Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries), entered into
consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas on
October 30, 2002. These consent orders, among other things, limit the ability of
our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.

          Although we believe that amounts required for us to meet our financial
and operating obligations will be available from our subsidiaries and from funds
currently held by CNC and CIHC, our results for future periods are subject to
numerous uncertainties. We may encounter liquidity problems, which could affect
our ability to meet our obligations while attempting to meet competitive
pressures or adverse economic conditions.

The Obligations of CNC and CIHC are Structurally Subordinated to the Obligations
of CNC's and CIHC's Subsidiaries.

          Because our operations are conducted through subsidiaries, claims of
the creditors of those subsidiaries (including policyholders) will rank senior
to claims to distributions from the subsidiaries, which we depend on to make
payments on our obligations. CIHC's subsidiaries had indebtedness for borrowed
money (including capitalized lease obligations but excluding indebtedness to
affiliates), policy reserves and other liabilities of approximately $24.9
billion at September 30, 2002. The obligations of CNC and CIHC, as parent
holding companies, will rank effectively junior to these liabilities.

          If an insurance company subsidiary were to be liquidated, that
liquidation would be conducted under the insurance law of its state of domicile
by such state's insurance regulator as the receiver with respect to such
insurer's property and business. In the event of a default on our debt or our
insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization, our creditors and stockholders
will not have the right to proceed against the assets of our insurance
subsidiaries or to cause their liquidation under federal and state bankruptcy
laws.

Our Insurance Business Performance May Decline if Our Premium Rates Are Not
Adequate.

          We set the premium rates on our health insurance policies based on
facts and circumstances known at the time we issue the policies and on
assumptions about numerous variables, including the actuarial probability of a
policyholder incurring a claim, the severity, and the interest rate earned on
our

                                     -110-
<PAGE>

investment of premiums. In setting premium rates, we consider historical claims
information, industry statistics, the rates of our competitors and other
factors. If our actual claims experience proves to be less favorable than we
assumed and we are unable to raise our premium rates, our financial results may
be adversely affected. We generally cannot raise our health insurance premiums
in any state unless we first obtain the approval of the insurance regulator in
that state. We review the adequacy of our premium rates regularly and file rate
increases on our products when we believe existing premium rates are too low. It
is possible that we will not be able to obtain approval for premium rate
increases from currently pending requests or requests filed in the future. If we
are unable to raise our premium rates because we fail to obtain approval for a
rate increase in one or more states, our net income may decrease. If we are
successful in obtaining regulatory approval to raise premium rates due to
unfavorable actual claims experience, the increased premium rates may reduce the
volume of our new sales and cause existing policyholders to allow their policies
to lapse. This would reduce our premium income in future periods. Increased
lapse rates also could require us to expense all or a portion of the deferred
policy costs relating to lapsed policies in the period in which those policies
lapse, adversely affecting our financial results in that period.

We May Not Achieve the Goals of Certain Initiatives We Have Undertaken With
Respect to the Restructuring of One of Our Principal Insurance Groups.

          CIG, one of our principal insurance businesses, has experienced
increased losses in its investment portfolio, declining sales and expense levels
that do not match product pricing. We have adopted several initiatives designed
to improve CIG's operations including, among others, focusing sales efforts on
higher margin products; reducing operating expenses by eliminating or reducing
the costs of marketing certain products, personnel reductions and streamlined
administrative procedures; stabilizing the profitability of in force business,
particularly long-term care policies; combining certain legal insurance entities
to reduce burdens associated with statutory capital requirements; and improving
the performance of investments by reducing exposure to higher risk assets. We
have only recently adopted these initiatives and cannot assure you that they
will be successfully implemented.

Our Reserves for Future Insurance Policy Benefits and Claims May Prove To Be
Inadequate, Requiring Us To Increase Liabilities and Resulting In Reduced Net
Income and Shareholders' Equity.

          We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of
claims to our policyholders based on assumptions made by our actuaries. For our
health insurance business, we establish an active life reserve plus a liability
for due and unpaid claims, claims in the course of settlement, and incurred but
not reported claims, as well as a reserve for the present value of amounts not
yet due on claims. Many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities, such
as economic and social conditions, inflation, hospital and pharmaceutical costs,
changes in doctrines of legal liability, and extracontractual damage awards.
Therefore, the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on
extensive estimates, assumptions and prior years' statistics. Establishing
reserves is an uncertain process, and it is possible that actual claims will
materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition. Our financial performance depends
significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is
consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our
policies. If our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect, and
our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses, we would
be required to increase our liabilities resulting in an adverse effect to our
financial results and financial position.

Our Insurance Subsidiaries May be Required to Pay Assessments to Fund
Policyholder Losses or Liabilities; This May Have a Material Adverse Effect on
Our Results of Operations.

          The solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which an insurance
company does business may require that company to pay assessments (up to certain
prescribed limits) to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance
companies that become insolvent. Recent insolvencies of insurance companies
increase the possibility that these assessments may be required. These
assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would
threaten an insurer's financial strength and, in certain instances, may be
offset against future premium taxes. We cannot estimate the likelihood and
amount of

                                     -111-
<PAGE>

future assessments. Any future assessments may have a material adverse effect on
our financial results and financial position.

We are Subject to Further Risk of Loss Notwithstanding Our Reinsurance
Arrangements.

          We transfer exposure to certain risks to others through reinsurance
arrangements. Under these arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our
losses and expenses associated with reported and unreported claims in exchange
for a portion of policy premiums. The availability, amount and cost of
reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly.
Furthermore, we face credit risk with respect to reinsurance. When we obtain
reinsurance, we are still liable for those transferred risks if the reinsurer
cannot meet its obligations. Therefore, the inability of our reinsurers to meet
their financial obligations could materially affect our operations and financial
condition.

We Are Subject to Extensive Regulation.

          Our insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and
supervision in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which is primarily for the
benefit and protection of our customers, and not for the benefit of our
investors or creditors. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
insurance laws that establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative
powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
regulating sales and other practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms,
setting reserve and solvency requirements, determining the form and content of
required statutory financial statements, limiting dividends and prescribing the
type and amount of investments.

          We have been operating under heightened scrutiny from state insurance
regulators. As described in "Events Leading to The Chapter 11 Case and Related
Post-Petition Events - Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues," our insurance
subsidiaries domiciled in Texas, Bankers National Life Insurance Company and
Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), entered into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance
for the State of Texas on October 30, 2002.

In Certain Circumstances, Regulatory Authorities May Place Our Insurance
Subsidiaries Under Regulatory Control.

          Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital
requirements. These requirements were designed to evaluate the adequacy of
statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks
associated with: asset quality; mortality and morbidity; asset and liability
matching; and other business factors. The requirements are used by states as an
early warning tool to discover potential weakly capitalized companies for the
purpose of initiating regulatory action. Generally, if an insurer's risk-based
capital falls below specified levels, the insurer would be subject to different
degrees of regulatory action depending upon the magnitude of the deficiency.
Possible regulatory actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions
to correct the risk-based capital deficiency to placing the insurer under
regulatory control.

Recently Enacted and Pending or Future Legislation Could Also Affect the
Financial Performance of Our Insurance Operations.

          During recent years, the health insurance industry has experienced
substantial changes, including those caused by healthcare legislation. Recent
federal and state legislation and legislative proposals relating to healthcare
reform contain features that could severely limit or eliminate our ability to
vary our pricing terms or apply medical underwriting standards with respect to
individuals which could have the effect of increasing our loss ratios and have
an adverse effect on our financial results. In particular, Medicare reform and
legislation concerning prescription drugs could affect our ability to price or
sell our products.

          Proposals currently pending in Congress and some state legislatures
may also affect our financial results. These proposals include the
implementation of minimum consumer protection standards for inclusion in all
long term care policies, including: guaranteed premium rates; protection against
inflation; limitations on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions; setting
standards for sales practices for long term

                                     -112-
<PAGE>

care insurance; and guaranteed consumer access to information about insurers
(including lapse and replacement rates for policies and the percentage of claims
denied). Enactment of any of these proposals could adversely affect our
financial results.

          In addition, the federal government may seek to regulate the insurance
industry, and recent government regulation may increase competition in the
insurance industry and may affect our insurance subsidiaries' current sales
methods. Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate
the insurance industry, federal initiatives often have a direct impact on the
insurance business. Current and proposed measures that may significantly affect
the insurance business generally include limitations on antitrust immunity and
minimum solvency requirements.

Changing Interest Rates May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

          Profitability may be directly affected by the level of and
fluctuations in interest rates. While we monitor the interest rate environment
and employ hedging strategies designed to mitigate the impact of changes in
interest rates, our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in
interest rates. Our spread-based insurance and annuity business is subject to
several inherent risks arising from movements in interest rates, especially if
we fail to anticipate or respond to such movements. First, interest rate changes
can cause compression of our net spread between interest earned on investments
and interest credited on customer deposits, thereby adversely affecting our
results. Second, if interest rate changes produce an unanticipated increase in
surrenders of our spread-based products, we may be forced to sell investment
assets at a loss in order to fund such surrenders. At September 30, 2002,
approximately 20 percent of our total insurance liabilities (or approximately
$4.5 billion) could be surrendered by the policyholder without penalty. Finally,
changes in interest rates can have significant effects on the performance of our
mortgage-backed securities portfolio, including collateralized mortgage
obligations, as a result of changes in the prepayment rate of the loans
underlying such securities. We follow asset/liability strategies that are
designed to mitigate the effect of interest rate changes on our profitability.
However, there can be no assurance that management will be successful in
implementing such strategies and achieving adequate investment spreads.

Litigation and Regulatory Investigations May Harm Our Financial Strength and
Reduce Our Profitability.

          Insurance companies historically have been subject to substantial
litigation resulting from claims disputes and other matters. In addition to the
traditional policy claims associated with their businesses, insurance companies
are increasingly facing policyholder suits, class actions and disputes with
reinsurers. The class actions and policyholder suits are often in connection
with insurance sales practices, policy and claims administration practices and
other market conduct issues. State insurance departments are increasingly
focusing on sales practices and product issues in their market conduct
examinations. Negotiated settlements of class action and other lawsuits have had
a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of
operations of insurance companies. As a result of these trends, we are in the
ordinary course of our business a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out
of our insurance business and investment operations, including class actions and
reinsurance disputes, and, from time to time, are also involved in various
governmental and administrative proceedings. Such litigation and proceedings may
harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. We cannot assure you
that such litigation will not adversely affect our future business, financial
condition or results of operations.

A Delay or an Unfavorable Outcome in the Dispute Surrounding Our Interest in the
GM Building May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Our Ability to Fund
Our Business Plan.

          As explained in Section VI.G.3 above, entities controlled by Donald J.
Trump currently dispute CNC's subsidiary's ability to acquire the GM Building
and later to monetize that asset. This dispute could delay New CNC's
subsidiary's ability to sell the GM Building and distribute the profits of that
sale. CNC's projections presume that CNC's interest in the GM Building will be
monetized in the first quarter of 2004, although timing of actual resolution of
the dispute with Trump and sale of the building is not certain. The mortgages on
the GM Building, which total $700 million, are due on August 1, 2003.

                                     -113-
<PAGE>

The Markets in Which We Compete Are Highly Competitive.

          Each of the markets in which we operate is highly competitive.
Competitors include other life insurers, commercial banks, thrifts, mutual funds
and broker-dealers. Many of our competitors in different segments and regions
are larger companies that have greater capital, technological and marketing
resources, and have access to capital at a lower cost. Because the actual cost
of products is unknown when they are sold, we are subject to competitors who may
sell a product at a price that does not cover its actual cost.

          Agents placing insurance business with our insurance subsidiaries
generally are compensated on a commission basis. There are many life and health
insurance companies in the U.S. Some of these companies may pay higher
commissions and charge lower premium rates, and many companies have more
substantial resources than we do. Publicity about our recent financial
difficulties may cause agents to place business with other insurers.

          We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our insurance
and annuity products. Strong competition exists among financial services
companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial
services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our
financial position, support services and compensation and product features. Our
competitiveness for such agents also depends upon the relationships we develop
with these agents. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales
representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues
would suffer.

Tax Law Changes Could Adversely Affect Our Insurance Product Sales and
Profitability.

          We sell deferred annuities and some forms of life insurance products
which are attractive to purchasers, in part, because policyholders generally are
not subject to United States federal income tax on increases in policy values
until some form of distribution is made. Recently, Congress enacted legislation
to lower marginal tax rates, reduce the federal estate tax gradually over a
ten-year period, with total elimination of the federal estate tax in 2010 and
increase contributions which may be made to individual retirement accounts and
401(k) accounts. While these tax law changes will sunset at the beginning of
2011 absent future congressional action, they could in the interim diminish the
appeal of our annuity and life insurance products. Additionally, Congress has
considered, from time to time, other possible changes to the U.S. tax laws,
including elimination of the tax deferral on the accretion of value within
certain annuities and life insurance products. There can be no assurance that
further tax legislation will not be enacted which would contain provisions with
possible adverse effects on our annuity and life insurance products.

The Impact of Recent Terrorist Attacks and Possible Military and Other Actions
May Adversely Affect the Insurance Industry and Financial Markets.

          Terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. on September
11, 2001 adversely affected commerce throughout the United States and resulted
in significant disruption to the insurance industry and significant declines and
volatility in financial markets. The continued threat of terrorism within the
United States and abroad, and the military action and heightened security
measures in response to that threat, including the possibility of hostilities in
Iraq, may cause additional disruptions to the insurance industry, reduced
economic activity and continued volatility in markets throughout the world,
which may adversely impact our financial results.

                                      IX.
                     CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

          The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Restructuring to the Debtors and Holders of Lender Claims,
Original Notes, Exchange Notes, 93/94 Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old
CNC Equity Interests. We sometimes refer to the Original Notes and the Exchange
Notes collectively as the "New Notes". This summary is based on the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury Regulations thereunder,
and administrative and judicial interpretations and practice, all as in effect
on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, with possible
retroactive effect. Due to the lack of definitive judicial and administrative
authority in a number of areas, substantial uncertainty may exist with respect
to some of the tax consequences described below. No opinion of counsel has been
obtained, and the Debtors do not intend to seek a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS") as to any of such tax consequences, and there can be
no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences
of the Restructuring described below.

          This summary does not apply to Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes,
93/94 Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity Interests that are
not United States persons (as defined in the Code) or that are otherwise subject
to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example,
banks (which includes some or all of the Holders of Lender Claims), governmental
authorities or agencies, financial institutions, insurance companies,
pass-through entities, tax-exempt organizations, brokers and dealers in
securities, mutual funds, small business investment companies, and regulated
investment companies). The following discussion assumes that Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity
Interests hold such interests as "capital assets" within the meaning of Code
Section 1221. Moreover, this summary does not purport to cover all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may apply to Debtors and Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity
Interests based upon their particular circumstances. Additionally, this summary
does not discuss any tax consequences that may arise under state, local, or
foreign tax law.

          The Debtors and the Official Unsecured Committee continue to explore
various possible alternative structures to maximize the going concern value of
the Reorganized Debtors' estates. In this regard, if the Debtors and the
Official Unsecured Committee determine that an alternative structure should be
implemented, the Plan may be modified to effectuate such alternate structure;
provided that such modifications shall not affect the treatment and recoveries
of Holders of Claims and Equity Interests set forth herein.

          The following summary is not a substitute for careful tax planning and
advice based on the particular circumstances of each Holder of Lender Claims,
New Notes, 93/94 Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity Interests.
All Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences, as well as any applicable state, local, and foreign
consequences, of the Restructuring.

A.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
          AND EQUITY INTERESTS

          1.   Consequences to Holders of Lender Claims

          Pursuant to the Plan, the Lender Claims will be exchanged for the New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants. The U.S. federal income
tax consequences to Holders of the Lender Claims depend on whether (a) the
Reorganization will result in a deemed exchange of the Lender Claims for the New
Bank Debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (b) the Lender Claims are
treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code and (c) the Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization.

          Treasury regulations promulgated under Code Section 1001 (the
"Exchange Regulations") provide that if there is a "significant modification" in
the terms of a debt instrument, the modification is treated as a deemed exchange
of the debt instrument for a new debt instrument. The Exchange Regulations
provide that certain changes in the yield or timing of payments, changes in the
obligor or security and changes in payment expectation result in a significant
modification of debt instruments. It is expected that the terms of the Lender
Claims will be modified and that the modifications would be treated as
significant under Code Section 1001.

          Whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is determined based on
all the facts and circumstances, but most authorities have held that the length
of the term of a debt instrument is an important factor in determining whether
such instrument is a security for federal income tax purposes. These authorities
have indicated that a term of less than five years is evidence that the
instrument is not a security, whereas a term of ten years or more is evidence
that it is a security. There are numerous other factors that could be taken into
account in determining whether a debt instrument is a security, including among
others, the security for payment, the creditworthiness of the obligor, the
subordination or lack thereof to other creditors, the right to vote or otherwise
participate in the management of the obligor, convertibility of the instrument
into an equity interest of the obligor, whether payments of interest are fixed,
variable or contingent, and whether such payments are made on a current basis or
accrued.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).

          If the Lender Claims are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring is not treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of Lender
Claims will be treated as exchanging their Lender Claims for New Bank Debt, New
CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants in a taxable exchange under Section
1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of Lender Claims should recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of (a) the fair market value
of the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants received and (b) the "issue
price" of the New Bank Debt received (provided such New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Warrants and/or New Bank Debt is not allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest) and (ii) such Holder's basis in the Lender Claims. To the extent such
Holders hold their Lender Claims as capital assets, such gain or loss should be
capital in nature and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the Lender
Claims were held for more than one year (subject to the "market discount" rules
discussed below). To the extent that a portion of the New Bank Debt, New CNC
Preferred Stock or New CNC Warrants received in exchange for the Lender Claims
is allocable to accrued but untaxed interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary
income. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New
CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants received should equal the fair market
value of the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants as of the Effective
Date and a Holder's tax basis in New Bank Debt will equal its "issue price." The
issue price of the New Bank Debt should equal its stated principal amount since
neither the Lender Claims nor the New Bank Debt are (or will be) traded on an
established market and the New Bank Debt will provide for adequate stated
interest. A Holder's holding period for New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants should begin on the day following the Effective Date.

<PAGE>

          If the Lender Claims are treated as securities and the Restructuring
pursuant to which the Lender Claims are exchanged for New Bank Debt, New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants is treated as a tax-free reorganization,
Holders of Lender Claims should not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange,
except that a Holder may recognize ordinary income to the extent that New Bank
Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants are treated as received in
satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on the Lender Claims. See "Accrued
But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants equal to the tax basis
of the Lender Claims surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for
the New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants that includes
the holding period for the Lender Claims; provided that the tax basis of New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants treated as received in
satisfaction of accrued interest should equal the amount of such accrued
interest, and the holding period for such New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants should not include the holding period of the Lender Claims.

          2.   Consequences to Holders of New Notes, 93/94 Notes and Trust
               Preferred Securities

               (a)     Exchange of New Notes for New CNC Common Stock

          Whether Holders of New Notes will recognize gain or loss on the
exchange of New Notes for New CNC Common Stock depends on whether (a) the
Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and (b) the New Notes are
treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. The following series of New
Notes have terms to maturity between five and ten years and, based on their
terms to maturity and other features, these series of New Notes are likely to be
treated as securities for federal income tax purposes: 6.4% Original Notes
(issued on February 15, 1998 and maturing on February 10, 2003); 8.75% Original
Notes (issued on February 3, 2000 and maturing on February 9, 2004); 6.8%
Original Notes (issued on June 5, 1998 and maturing on June 15, 2005); 9.0%
Original Notes (issued October 19, 1999 and maturing on October 15, 2006);
10.75% Original Notes (issued June 27, 2001 and maturing on June 15, 2008); 6.8%
Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on June 15, 2007); 9.0%
Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on October 15, 2008); and
10.75% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on June 15, 2009).

          The following series of New Notes have terms to maturity of less than
five years and, based on their terms to maturity and other features, these
series of New Notes may not be treated as securities for federal income tax
purposes: 8.5% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on October
15, 2003); 6.4% Exchange Notes (issued April 24, 2002 and maturing on February
10, 2004); 8.75% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on
February 9, 2006); and 8.5% Original Notes (issued on October 18, 1999 and
maturing on October 15, 2002).

          If any series of New Notes are treated as securities and the
Restructuring pursuant to which the New Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common
Stock is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such New Notes should
not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a Holder may
recognize ordinary income to the extent that New CNC Common Stock is treated as
received in satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on such New Notes. See
"Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in
the New CNC Common Stock equal to the tax basis of the New Notes surrendered
therefor and should have a holding period for the New CNC Common Stock that
includes the holding period for the New Notes; provided that the tax basis of
any share of New CNC Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of accrued
interest should equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the holding
period for such New CNC Common Stock should not include the holding period of
the New Notes.

                                     -117-
<PAGE>

          If any series of New Notes are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring pursuant to which the New Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common
Stock does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such New Notes
will be treated as exchanging their New Notes for New CNC Common Stock in a
taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of the
New Notes should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the
fair market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the New Notes and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis in the New
Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature so long as the New Notes
are held as capital assets (subject to the "market discount" rules described
below) and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the New Notes were held
for more than one year. To the extent that a portion of the New CNC Common Stock
received in exchange for the New Notes is allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New CNC Common Stock received should
equal the fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock as of the Effective
Date. A Holder's holding period for New CNC Common Stock should begin on the day
following the Effective Date.

               (b)     Exchange of 93/94 Notes for New CNC Common Stock or New
                       Senior Notes

          Pursuant to the Plan, the Holders of 93/94 Notes will receive either
(a) New CNC Common Stock, (b) New Senior Notes or (c) some combination thereof.
Whether Holders of 93/94 Notes will recognize gain or loss on the exchange of
93/94 Notes for New CNC Common Stock or New Senior Notes depends on (a) the type
of consideration received (i.e., New CNC Common Stock or New Senior Notes); (b)
whether the Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and (c) whether
93/94 Notes and (if the Holders of 93/94 Notes receive New Senior Notes) New
Senior Notes are treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization
provisions of the Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. Each series of 93/94 Notes has a
term to maturity of approximately ten years and, based on their terms to
maturity and other features, the 93/94 Notes should be treated as securities for
federal income tax purposes. At this time, the maturity date and other terms of
the New Senior Notes have not yet been determined.

          If Holders of 93/94 Notes receive New CNC Common Stock under the Plan,
and (i) 93/94 Notes are treated as securities and (ii) the Restructuring
pursuant to which the 93/94 Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common Stock is
treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such 93/94 Notes should not
recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a Holder may recognize
ordinary income to the extent that New CNC Common Stock is treated as received
in satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on such 93/94 Notes. See
"Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in
the New CNC Common Stock equal to the tax basis of the 93/94 Notes surrendered
therefor and should have a holding period for the New CNC Common Stock that
includes the holding period for the 93/94 Notes; provided that the tax basis of
any share of New CNC Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of accrued
interest should equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the holding
period for such New CNC Common Stock should not include the holding period of
the 93/94 Notes.

          If Holders of 93/94 Notes receive New CNC Common Stock under the Plan,
and (i) the 93/94 Notes are not treated as securities or (ii) the Restructuring
pursuant to which the 93/94 Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common Stock does
not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such 93/94 Notes will be
treated as exchanging their 93/94 Notes for New CNC Common Stock in a taxable
exchange under Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of the 93/94
Notes should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the fair
market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the 93/94 Notes and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis in the 93/94
Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature so long as the 93/94 Notes
are held as capital assets (subject to the "market discount" rules described
below) and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the 93/94 Notes were held
for more than one year. To the extent that a portion of the New CNC Common Stock
received in

                                     -118-
<PAGE>


exchange for the 93/94 Notes is allocable to accrued but untaxed interest, the
Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below.
A Holder's tax basis in New CNC Common Stock received should equal the fair
market value of the New CNC Common Stock as of the Effective Date. A Holder's
holding period for New CNC Common Stock should begin on the day following the
Effective Date.

          If Holders of 93/94 Notes receive New Senior Notes under the Plan, and
(i) both, 93/94Notes and New Senior Notes are treated as securities and (ii) the
Restructuring pursuant to which the 93/94 Notes are exchanged for New Senior
Notes is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such 93/94 Notes
should not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a Holder may
recognize ordinary income to the extent that any portion of New Senior Notes is
treated as received in satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on such
93/94 Notes. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain
a tax basis in the New Senior Notes equal to the tax basis of the 93/94 Notes
surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for the New Senior Notes
that includes the holding period for the 93/94 Notes; provided that the tax
basis of any portion of New Senior Notes treated as received in satisfaction of
accrued interest should equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the
holding period for such New Senior Notes should not include the holding period
of the 93/94 Notes.

          If Holders of 93/94 Notes receive New Senior Notes under the Plan, and
(i) either the 93/94 Notes or New Senior Notes are not treated as securities or
(ii) the Restructuring pursuant to which the 93/94 Notes are exchanged for New
Senior Notes does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such
93/94 Notes will be treated as exchanging their 93/94 Notes for New Senior Notes
in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of
the 93/94 Notes should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between
(i) the value of New Senior Notes (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the 93/94 Notes and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis in the 93/94
Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature so long as the 93/94 Notes
are held as capital assets (subject to the "market discount" rules described
below) and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the 93/94 Notes were held
for more than one year. To the extent that a portion of the New Senior Notes
received in exchange for the 93/94 Notes is allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New Senior Notes received should equal
the value of the New Senior Notes as of the Effective Date. A Holder's holding
period for New Senior Notes should begin on the day following the Effective
Date.

               (c)     Exchange of Trust Preferred Securities for New CNC Common
                       Stock

          Whether Holders of Trust Preferred Securities will recognize gain or
loss on the exchange of Trust Preferred Securities for New CNC Common Stock
depends on whether (a) the Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization
and (b) the Subordinated Debentures underlying the Trust Preferred Securities
are treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. Each series of Trust Preferred
Securities (other than the 6.75% Trust Preferred Securities) has a term to
maturity of more than five years and, based on their term to maturity and other
features, the Subordinated Debentures underlying the Trust Preferred Securities
should be treated as securities for federal income tax purposes.

          If the Trust Preferred Securities are treated as securities and the
Restructuring pursuant to which the Trust Preferred Securities are exchanged for
New CNC Common Stock is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of the
Trust Preferred Securities should not recognize any gain or loss on the
exchange, except that a Holder may recognize ordinary income to the extent that
New CNC Common Stock is treated as received in satisfaction of accrued but
untaxed interest on Trust Preferred Securities. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New CNC Common

                                     -119-
<PAGE>

Stock equal to the tax basis of Trust Preferred Securities surrendered therefor
and should have a holding period for the New CNC Common Stock that includes the
holding period for the Trust Preferred Securities; provided that the tax basis
of any share of New CNC Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of
accrued interest should equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the
holding period for such New CNC Common Stock should not include the holding
period of the Trust Preferred Securities.

          If the Trust Preferred Securities are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring pursuant to which the Trust Preferred Securities are exchanged for
New CNC Common Stock does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of
such Trust Preferred Securities will be treated as exchanging their Trust
Preferred Securities for New CNC Common Stock in a taxable exchange under
Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of Trust Preferred Securities
should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the fair
market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the Trust Preferred Securities and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis
in the Trust Preferred Securities. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature
(subject to the "market discount" rules described below) and should be long-term
capital gain or loss if the Trust Preferred Securities were held for more than
one year. To the extent that a portion of the New CNC Common Stock received in
exchange for the Trust Preferred Securities is allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New CNC Common Stock (including in any
fractional share) received should equal the fair market value of the New CNC
Common Stock as of the Effective Date. A Holder's holding period for New CNC
Common Stock (including for any fractional share) should begin on the day
following the Effective Date.

               (d)     Accrued Interest and Market Discount

               (i)     Accrued But Untaxed Interest

          To the extent that any amount received in the Reorganization by a
Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities is
attributable to accrued but untaxed interest, such amount should be taxable to
the Holder as interest income, if such accrued interest has not been previously
included in the Holder's gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Conversely, a Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred
Securities may be able to recognize a deductible loss (or, possibly, a write-off
against a reserve for bad debts) to the extent that any accrued interest was
previously included in the Holder's gross income but was not paid in full by
CNC.

          The extent to which New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock,
93/94 Notes or New CNC Warrants received by a Holder of Lender Claims, New
Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities will be attributable to accrued
but untaxed interest is unclear. Under the Plan, the aggregate consideration to
be distributed to Holders of Allowed Claims in each Class will be treated as
first satisfying an amount equal to the stated principal amount of the Allowed
Claim for such Holders and any remaining consideration as satisfying accrued,
but unpaid, interest, if any. Certain legislative history indicates that an
allocation of consideration as between principal and interest provided in a
bankruptcy plan is binding for federal income tax purposes. However, the IRS
could take the position that the consideration received by a Holder should be
allocated in some way other than as provided in the Plan. Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes and Trust Preferred Securities should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the proper allocation of the consideration
received by them under the Plan.

               (ii)    Market Discount

          Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes and Trust Preferred
Securities who exchange Lender Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred
Securities for New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock, New
Senior Notes or New CNC Warrants may be affected by the "market discount"
provisions of Code Sections 1276 through 1278. Under these rules, some or all of
the gain realized by a Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes or Trust Preferred
Securities may be treated as ordinary income (instead of capital gain), to the
extent of the amount of "market discount" on such Lender Claims, New Notes,
93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities.

                                     -120-
<PAGE>


          In general, a debt obligation with a fixed maturity of more than one
year that is acquired by a holder on the secondary market (or, in certain
circumstances, upon original issuance) is considered to be a acquired with
"market discount" as to that holder if the debt obligation's stated redemption
price at maturity (or revised issue price, in the case of a debt obligation
issued with original issue discount) exceeds the tax basis of the debt
obligation in the holder's hands immediately after its acquisition. However, a
debt obligation will not be a "market discount bond" if such excess is less than
a statutory de minimis amount (equal to 0.25 percent of the debt obligation's
stated redemption price at maturity or revised issue price, in the case of a
debt obligation issued with original issue discount).

          Any gain recognized by a Holder on the taxable disposition of Lender
Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities (determined as
described above) that were acquired with market discount should be treated as
ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that accrued thereon while
the Lender Claims, New Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities were
considered to be held by a Holder (unless the Holder elected to include market
discount in income as it accrued). To the extent that the Lender Claims, New
Notes, 93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities that were acquired with market
discount are exchanged in a tax-free transaction for other property (as may
occur here), any market discount that accrued on the Lender Claims, New Notes,
93/94 Notes or Trust Preferred Securities (i.e., up to the time of the exchange)
but was not recognized by the Holder is carried over to the property received
therefor and any gain recognized on the subsequent sale, exchange, redemption or
other disposition of such property is treated as ordinary income to the extent
of such accrued market discount.

               (e)     Receipt of Interests in a Residual Trust

          On the Effective Date, the Residual Trust shall be settled and exist
as a grantor trust for the benefit of certain creditors. Subject to definitive
guidance from the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction to the contrary
(including the receipt of an adverse determination by the IRS upon audit if not
contested by the Residual Trustee), pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.671-1(a) and/or Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d) and related
regulations, the Residual Trustee may designate and file returns for the
Residual Trust as a "grantor trust" and/or "liquidating trust" and therefore,
for federal income tax purposes, the Residual Trust's taxable income (or loss)
should be allocated pro rata to its beneficiaries.

          The tax consequences of the right to receive and of the receipt (if
any) of property from the Residual Trust are uncertain, and may depend, among
other things, on the timing of the distribution and the nature of the property
received. It is possible that the receipt of property from the Residual Trust
would be a taxable event to the Holders of Claims at the time the property is
received; however, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to treat the
right to receive property from the Residual Trust as property received at the
time of the Restructuring, and tax it in the same manner as cash or other
property received on the exchange. Alternatively, the Holders of Claims could be
treated as exchanging the right to receive property from the Residual Trust for
a portion of their Claims. Finally, a portion of any amount of property received
from the Residual Trust may be treated in respect of accrued but unpaid interest
to the Holders of Claims. In light of these substantial uncertainties, Holders
of Claims are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences
of the right to receive and of the receipt (if any) of property from the
Residual Trust.

          3.   Consequences to Holders of Old CNC Preferred Stock and Old CNC
               Common Stock

          Holders of Old CNC Preferred Stock and Old CNC Common Stock that is
cancelled in the Restructuring will be allowed a worthless stock deduction
(unless such Holder had previously claimed a worthless stock deduction with
respect to any Old CNC Preferred Stock or Old CNC Common Stock and assuming that
the taxable year that includes the Restructuring is the same taxable year in
which such stock first became worthless) in an amount equal to the Holder's
adjusted basis in the Old CNC Preferred Stock and/or Old CNC Common Stock. A
worthless stock deduction is a deduction allowed to a holder of a corporation's
stock for the taxable year in which such stock becomes worthless. If the Holder
held Old CNC Preferred Stock and/or Old CNC Common Stock as a capital asset, the
loss will be treated as a loss from the sale or exchange of such capital asset.

                                     -121-
<PAGE>

          4.   Consequences to Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
               Claims

          Pursuant to the Plan, Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims may receive a distribution of New CNC Common Stock in respect of such
claims. Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims should recognize
gain or loss equal to the amount realized under the Plan in respect of their
claims less their respective tax basis in those claims. The amount realized for
this purpose generally will equal the fair market value of New CNC Common stock
and other consideration (if any) received under the Plan. Any gain or loss
recognized in the exchange will be capital or ordinary depending on the status
of the claim in the Holder's hands. The Holder's aggregate tax basis for any
consideration received under the Plan should equal the fair market value of the
property received under the Plan. The holding period for any consideration under
the Plan generally will begin on the day following the Effective Date.

          5.   Treatment of Subsequent Distributions on New CNC Preferred Stock
               and New CNC Common Stock

               (a)     Distributions--In General

          The amount of distributions (other than any constructive distributions
on the New CNC Preferred Stock (see discussion below)), if any, by New CNC in
respect of the New CNC Common Stock and the New CNC Preferred Stock will be
equal to the amount of cash and the fair market value as of the date of
distribution of any property distributed. Subject to the discussion in paragraph
(d) immediately below, regarding redemption of New CNC Preferred Stock,
distributions generally will be treated for federal income tax purposes first as
a taxable dividend to the extent of New CNC's current and accumulated earnings
and profits (as determined for federal income tax purposes) and then as a
tax-free return of capital to the extent of the holder's tax basis in its stock,
with any excess treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of the stock.

               (b)     PIK Distributions

          Distributions on the New CNC Preferred Stock will be paid in kind with
additional shares of New CNC Preferred Stock until the later of (i) the second
anniversary of the Effective Date or (ii) the next fiscal quarter after the date
that the principal insurance subsidiaries of New CNC achieve any "A" category
financial strength rating by A.M. Best; thereafter, distributions may be paid in
kind with additional shares of New CNC Preferred Stock thereafter at the option
of New CNC. Any such distribution of additional shares of New CNC Preferred
Stock generally will be taxed under the general distribution rules described
above. Under these rules, the amount of any such distribution generally will
equal the fair market value of the New CNC Preferred Stock so received on the
distribution date and be treated for federal income tax purposes first as a
taxable dividend to the extent of New CNC's current and accumulated earnings and
profits (as determined for federal income tax purposes) and then as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of the holder's tax basis in its stock, with any
excess treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of the stock. In
addition, a holder's tax basis in the New CNC Preferred Stock so received will
equal the fair market value of such stock on the distribution date, and such
holder's holding period for such stock will commence on the date following the
distribution date.

               (c)     Constructive Distributions on New CNC Preferred Stock

          If the New CNC Preferred Stock (including any New CNC Preferred Stock
paid in kind as described in paragraph (b) above) is treated as having more than
a de minimis "redemption premium" (i.e., an excess of the redemption price of
the New CNC Preferred Stock over its "issue price"), holders may be treated as
receiving constructive distributions of additional shares of New CNC Preferred
Stock totaling the amount of such "redemption premium" over the period of time
during which the New CNC Preferred Stock is outstanding, based on a constant
yield-to-maturity method that reflects compounding. These constructive
distributions would be in addition to the distributions described in paragraph
(b) above and would generally be taxed in the same manner. Although the matter
is subject to some uncertainty, New CNC intends to take

                                     -122-
<PAGE>

the position that the New CNC Preferred Stock has an "issue price" equivalent to
its fair market value on the issue date. New CNC will provide to holders of New
CNC Preferred Stock the title and address or telephone number of a New CNC
representative who will make available to holders upon the request of such
holders the information required to comply with the constructive distribution
provisions described in this paragraph (c).

               (d)     Subsequent Sale, Redemption, or other disposition of New
                       CNC Common Stock or New CNC Preferred Stock

          The federal income tax treatment to a holder of New CNC Common Stock
and/or New CNC Preferred Stock upon sale, redemption, or other disposition of
such stock will depend on the particular facts relating to such holder at the
time of such sale, redemption, or other disposition. Generally, any gain
recognized by a holder may be treated as ordinary income to the extent of (i)
any bad debt deductions (or additions to a bad debt reserve) claimed with
respect to such holder's claim and any ordinary loss deductions incurred upon
satisfaction of its claim, less any income (other than interest income)
recognized by the holder upon satisfaction of its claim, and (ii) any amounts
received by cash-basis holder which would have been included in its gross income
if the holder's claim had been satisfied in full but which was not included by
reason of the cash method of accounting.

          The rules applicable to the treatment of the receipt of constructive
distributions, and the sale, redemption, or other disposition of New CNC Common
Stock and/or New CNC Preferred Stock are complex and in some cases uncertain.
Thus, holders of New CNC Common Stock and/or New CNC Preferred Stock are urged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the rules to
their particular situations.

B.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO CNC

          1.   G Reorganization

          CNC intends to accomplish the Restructuring in the form of a
reorganization described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G) (a "G Reorganization").
Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, CNC will transfer substantially all
of its assets (principally the stock of CIHC and other direct subsidiaries of
CNC) to New CNC in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock,
New CNC Warrants, New Senior Notes and New CNC's assumption of certain
indebtedness of CNC, as specified in the Plan. Certain of CNC's assets (the
"unwanted assets") will not be transferred to New CNC. The unwanted assets
consist of (i) the stock of certain indirect subsidiaries of CNC that management
of CNC has determined do not have material operations that would be beneficial
to New CNC and its subsidiaries and (ii) cash or cash equivalents that will be
used to satisfy certain obligations of CNC pursuant to the Plan. CNC will then
distribute New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock, New Senior Notes and
New CNC Warrants to Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust Preferred
Securities.

          This transfer of assets and distribution of New CNC Common Stock, New
CNC Preferred Stock, New Senior Notes and New CNC Warrants pursuant to the Plan
should constitute a reorganization as described in Code ss. 368(a)(1)(G),
assuming that certain non-statutory requirements, such as the requirement that a
reorganization have a business purpose and preserve continuity of proprietary
interest, are satisfied. The (i) corporate law benefits to be derived from an
incorporation of New CNC in Delaware, (ii) ability of CNC to leave unwanted
assets behind in the Reorganization in order to facilitate the winding up of
certain non-critical subsidiaries and the satisfaction of certain claims
pursuant to the Plan, and (iii) ability of CNC to substantially reduce its debt
in the Reorganization should satisfy the business purpose requirement. For
purposes of G reorganizations, a corporation's creditors that receive stock are
considered to hold proprietary interests; as a result, the receipt of New CNC
Common Stock and New CNC Preferred Stock by the holders of Lender Claims, New
Notes and Trust Preferred Securities should satisfy the requirements for
continuity of proprietary interest. Accordingly, the transfer of assets by CNC
to New CNC in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New
CNC Warrants and the distribution of all consideration received from New CNC to
the creditors of CNC should constitute a G Reorganization.

                                     -123-
<PAGE>

          Assuming that the transfers and distributions described above
constitute a G reorganization, (i) CNC will recognize no gain or loss with
respect to such transactions, (ii) CNC's taxable year will close on the
Effective Date and it will begin a new taxable year on the day after the
Effective Date, and (iii) all of CNC's tax attributes existing on the Effective
Date, including NOLs and other loss and credit carryovers, will be transferred
to New CNC as of the close of the Effective Date. Thus any income recognized by
CNC (and not excluded under Code ss. 108) in its tax year beginning on the day
following the Effective Date (or subsequent tax years), during its winding up,
will not be protected by CNC's pre-Effective Date NOLs, but only by NOLs (if
any) incurred after the Effective Date or attributable to unwanted assets.

          If the transfers and distributions described above do not constitute a
G reorganization, (i) CNC will recognize gain or loss with respect to the
transaction, although the amount of such gain, if any, is not expected to exceed
the amount of the NOL of CNC, and thus is not expected to result in any tax upon
CNC, (ii) CNC's taxable year will not close on the Effective Date, and (iii) all
of CNC's tax attributes should remain with CNC, and will not be transferred to
New CNC.

          Although CNC anticipates that it will accomplish the restructuring
through a G reorganization structure (described above), there is a small
possibility that the restructuring could be accomplished by other means if CNC
determines that such alternative structure could maximize tax savings to New CNC
and would not adversely affect the tax treatment of Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests.

          2.   Cancellation of Indebtedness and Reduction of Tax Attributes

          As a result of the Restructuring, the amount of CNC's aggregate
outstanding indebtedness will be substantially reduced. In general, absent an
exception, a debtor will realize and recognize cancellation of indebtedness
income ("COD Income") upon satisfaction of its outstanding indebtedness for
total consideration less than the amount of such indebtedness. The amount of COD
Income, in general, is the excess of (a) the adjusted issue price of the
indebtedness satisfied, over (b) the sum of the issue price of any new
indebtedness of the taxpayer issued, the amount of cash paid and the fair market
value of any new consideration (including stock of the debtor) given in
satisfaction of such indebtedness at the time of the exchange.

          A debtor will not, however, be required to include any amount of COD
Income in gross income if the debtor is under the jurisdiction of a court in a
Title 11 bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge of debt occurs pursuant to that
proceeding. Instead, as a consequence of such exclusion, a debtor must reduce
its tax attributes by the amount of COD Income which it excluded from gross
income under Code Section 108. In general, tax attributes will be reduced in the
following order: (a) net operating losses ("NOLs"), (b) tax credits and capital
loss carryovers, and (c) tax basis in assets.

          Because the Plan provides that Holders of New Notes, Lender Claims and
Trust Preferred Securities will receive New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Warrants and New Bank Debt, the amount of COD Income, and
accordingly the amount of tax attributes required to be reduced, will depend on
the fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Warrants and the issue price of New Bank Debt. These values and issue price
of the New Bank Debt cannot be known with certainty until after the Effective
Date. Thus, although it is expected that a reduction of tax attributes will be
required, the exact amount of such reduction cannot be predicted.

C.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NEW CNC

          1.   Transfer of Assets from CNC to New CNC

          New CNC will recognize no gain or loss with respect to the receipt of
CNC assets in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New
CNC Warrants pursuant to the Restructuring. Assuming, as described above, that
the transfer of assets by CNC to New CNC constitutes a G reorganization, the
assets transferred to New CNC will have the same basis in New CNC's hands as
such assets did in CNC's hands, and New CNC's holding period for such assets
will include CNC's holding period. New CNC will also succeed to CNC's tax
attributes at the close of the Effective Date. Subject to potential limitations
imposed by Code Section 382, as described below, New CNC intends to take the

                                     -124-
<PAGE>

position that CNC will succeed to the attributes of New CNC without reduction
for the COD Income of CNC, and that such attributes will be available to offset
income of New CNC in its tax year beginning on the day following the Effective
Date (and in subsequent tax years). However, there is no assurance that the IRS
will not take a contrary position and assert that New CNC will only succeed to
the attributes of CNC with a reduction for the COD Income of CNC under Code
Section 108(b), or, as discussed below, that Code Section 269 will apply to
reduce or eliminate New CNC's ability to use the attributes of CNC.

          2.   Limitation of Net Operating Loss Carryovers and Other Tax
               Attributes

          Code Section 382 generally limits a corporation's use of its NOLs (and
may limit a corporation's use of certain built-in losses if such built-in losses
are recognized within a five-year period following an ownership change) if a
corporation undergoes an "ownership change." This discussion describes the
limitation determined under Code Section 382 in the case of an "ownership
change" as the "Section 382 Limitation." The Section 382 Limitation on the use
of pre-change losses (the NOLs and built-in losses recognized within the five
year post-ownership change period) in any "post change year" is generally equal
to the product of the fair market value of the loss corporation's outstanding
stock immediately before the ownership change and the long term tax-exempt rate
(which is published monthly by the Treasury Department and most recently was
approximately 4.61%) in effect for the month in which the ownership change
occurs. In addition, Code Section 383 applies a similar limitation to capital
loss carryforwards and tax credits.

          In general, an ownership change occurs when the percentage of the
corporation's stock owned by certain "5 percent shareholders" increases by more
than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned at any time during
the applicable "testing period" (generally, the shorter of (a) the three-year
period preceding the testing date or (b) the period of time since the most
recent ownership change of the corporation). A "5 percent shareholder" for these
purposes includes, generally, an individual or entity that directly or
indirectly owns 5 percent or more of a corporation's stock during the relevant
period, and may include one or more groups of shareholders that in the aggregate
own less than 5 percent of the value of the corporation's stock. Under
applicable Treasury Regulations, an ownership change with respect to an
affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return that have
consolidated NOLs is generally measured by changes in stock ownership of the
parent corporation of the group. An ownership change will occur with respect to
CNC and its successor, New CNC, in connection with the Plan. Therefore, New
CNC's ability to use its NOLs will be limited by Code ss. 382.

          When an "ownership change" occurs pursuant to the implementation of a
plan of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code, the general Section 382
Limitation may not apply if certain requirements are satisfied. Under Section
382(l)(5) of the Code, the Section 382 Limitation does not apply to an ownership
change of a loss corporation if the corporation was under the jurisdiction of a
bankruptcy court immediately before the change and those persons who were
shareholders and creditors of the loss corporation immediately before the
ownership change own at least 50 percent of the loss corporation's stock by
value and voting power after the ownership change (the "Bankruptcy Exception").

          Thus, under Code Section 382(l)(5), New CNC would avoid entirely the
application of the Section 382 Limitation to the NOLs and recognized built-in
losses, if any, but would be required to reduce their NOLs and possibly other
tax attributes by any deduction for interest claimed by CNC with respect to any
indebtedness converted into stock for (a) the three-year period preceding the
taxable year of the "ownership change" and (b) the portion of the year of the
"ownership change" prior to the consummation of the Plan. However, New CNC
currently intends to elect out of the application of Code Section 382(l)(5).
Instead, CNC expects to take advantage of the special rule in Code Section
382(l)(6) (discussed immediately below).

          As noted above, the Section 382 Limitation is generally determined by
reference to the fair market value of the loss corporation's outstanding stock
immediately before the ownership change. However, Code Section 382(l)(6)
provides that a debtor may elect, in the case of an ownership change resulting
from a bankruptcy proceeding of a debtor, to have the value of the debtor's
stock for the purpose of calculating the Section 382 Limitation determined by
reference to the net equity value of the debtor's stock immediately after the
ownership change. Although it is not possible to know with certainty what the
fair market value

                                     -125-
<PAGE>

of New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Preferred Stock will be following the
Effective Date (and accordingly what the amount of the Section 382 Limitation
would be), CNC believes that the Code Section 382(l)(6) rule could be of
significant benefit with respect to New CNC's ability to utilize any remaining
tax attributes following the Effective Date. Accordingly, CNC currently intends
to elect the application of this rule. Thus, for purposes of calculating the
Section 382 Limitation, the value of New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Preferred
Stock would reflect the increase, if any, in value resulting from any surrender
or cancellation of creditors' claims against CNC in the bankruptcy.

          3.   Application of Code Section 269 to the G Reorganization

          Pursuant to Code Section 269(a)(1), the IRS may disallow a corporate
tax benefit if the principal purpose for an acquisition of 50% or more (in vote
or value) of the stock of a corporation (the "Applicable Stock Acquisition") is
the evasion or avoidance of federal income tax by securing a corporate tax
benefit that would not otherwise be available. Furthermore, pursuant to Code
Section 269(a)(2), the IRS may disallow a corporate tax benefit if the principal
purpose for certain asset acquisitions (the "Applicable Asset Acquisition") is
the evasion or avoidance of federal income tax by securing a corporate tax
benefit that would not otherwise be available. If the IRS were to assert Code
Section 269 with respect to an Applicable Stock Acquisition or an Applicable
Asset Acquisition, the taxpayer would have the burden of proof because the IRS's
determination of a tax avoidance principal purpose is presumptively correct. If
the taxpayer is unable to carry the burden of proving a principal purpose other
than tax avoidance, the determination of a tax avoidance would stand.

          In the Reorganization, New CNC will acquire substantially all of the
assets of CNC and more than 50% in value of New CNC Common Stock will be
acquired by Holders of New Notes and Trust Preferred Securities. If the IRS
determines that either the acquisition of New CNC Common Stock or CNC assets is
principally for tax avoidance purposes, it could assert that Code Section 269
authorizes it to disallow deductions with respect to some or all of New CNC's
NOLs. This determination is primarily a question of fact.

          There is a risk that the IRS could assert that the principal purpose
of the G Reorganization is to enhance the ability of the New CNC to utilize its
NOLs. To prevail in this assertion, the IRS must demonstrate that the purpose to
evade or avoid federal income tax exceeds in importance any other purpose. The
determination of the purpose for which an acquisition was made requires a
scrutiny of the entire circumstances in which the transaction or course of
conduct occurred, in connection with the tax result claimed to arise therefrom.
Courts are generally reluctant to invoke Code Section 269 where a reasonable
business purpose existed for the timing and form of the acquisition, even if the
availability of NOLs was also a major consideration in the transaction.

          As noted above, the determination of whether tax avoidance is the
principal motivation of a transaction is primarily a question of fact. Although
the matter is subject to some uncertainty, CNC believes that, if the G
Reorganization were challenged by the IRS, the IRS should not be able to
demonstrate that the federal tax avoidance was the principal motivation for the
G Reorganization. CNC believes that the acquisition of control of CNC and New
CNC by holders of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust Preferred Securities
pursuant to the Plan will be made for legitimate business purposes. The Holders
of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust Preferred Securities will be offered New
CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants because CNC
cannot offer them sufficient cash and/or new debt instruments to preserve their
investment in CNC. In light of business exigencies requiring CNC to satisfy most
of the claims against CNC with New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and
New CNC Warrants, tax avoidance should not be considered the principal
motivation for the Plan. Further, CNC believes that there are legitimate
business purposes for the reincorporation of CNC, an Indiana corporation, as New
CNC, a Delaware corporation, which will carry on the CNC business unhampered by
concerns relating to the unwanted assets. Accordingly, CNC believes that Code
Section 269 should not apply to the G Reorganization.

          If, nevertheless, the IRS were to make an assertion that Code Section
269 applied and such assertion were sustained, Code Section 269 would severely
limit or even extinguish New CNC's ability to utilize CNC's pre-ownership change
NOLs to which it succeeded in the G Reorganization. Due to the

                                     -126-
<PAGE>

highly fact dependent nature of this issue, there can be no assurance that the
IRS would not prevail if it were to assert the application of Code Section 269
to the G Reorganization.

          4.   Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

          Under the backup withholding rules, a Holder of a Claim may be subject
to backup withholding with respect to distributions or payments made pursuant to
the Plan unless that holder (a) comes within certain exempt categories (which
generally include corporations) and, when required, demonstrates that fact or
(b) provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies under
penalty of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct and that
the holder is not subject to backup withholding because of a failure to report
all dividend and interest income. Backup withholding is not an additional tax,
but merely an advance payment that may be refunded to the extent it results in
an overpayment of tax.

          CNC and New CNC will withhold all amounts required by law to be
withheld from payments of interest and dividends. CNC and New CNC will comply
with all applicable reporting requirements of the Code.

THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN ARE COMPLEX. THE FOREGOING
SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE
RELEVANT TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND
INCOME TAX SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS OF LENDER CLAIMS, NEW NOTES, SECURED NOTES,
TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND EQUITY INTERESTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED BY THE RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, AND OF ANY CHANGE IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.

                                 RECOMMENDATION

          In the opinion of the Debtors, the Plan is preferable to the
alternatives described herein because it provides for a larger distribution to
the Holders than would otherwise result in a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code. In addition, any alternative other than confirmation of the
Plan could result in extensive delays and increased administrative expenses
resulting in smaller distributions to the Holders of Claims. Accordingly, the
Debtors recommend that Holders of Claims entitled to vote on the Plan support
confirmation of the Plan and vote to accept the Plan.
