The designation or non-designation of an employee as an Eligible Employee will be decided by the Committee or the chief executive officer in its or his sole discretion with respect to each Plan Year and without regard to an employee having or not having been designated as an Eligible Employee in any prior Plan Year.  Designation as an Eligible Employee in one Plan Year does not create a right or imply that the employee will be designated as an Eligible Employee in any other Plan Year.  No members of the Board of Directors, except those who are salaried employees of the Corporation, may be designated as an Eligible Employee under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Changes of Prior Determinations</U>.

<BR>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Allocation of Awards<BR>
<BR>
</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Allocation of Awards and Award Pools by the Committee</U>.  During the first quarter of the Year following the end of each Plan Year and after the Committee's receipt of the report referred to in Section 5(c) above, the Committee shall allocate individual Awards (if any) to those Eligible Employees whose annual base salary is determined by the Committee and establish an Award pool to be allocated by the chief executive officer of the Company among all other Eligible Employees.  Any such allocations shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan; provided, however, that the Committee may, in the exercise of its discretion allocate no Awards or Award pools for a particular Plan Year.  The total amount of all Awards and Award pools shall not exceed the total amount credited to the Incentive Provision for the most recently completed Plan Year, as determined in accordance with Section 4 hereof.  <BR>

Subject to the provisions of Sections 4, 5, and 6, the Eligible Employees for a given Plan Year shall be allocated Awards for such Plan Year in the individual amounts as the Committee or the chief executive officer of the Company in accordance with the Plan may in its or his sole discretion determine.  Designation as an Eligible Employee and/or inclusion on the chief executive officer's report referred to in Section 5(c) does not give an individual a right or entitlement to be allocated an Award.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Other Incentive Programs</U>.  The amount of any Award allocated to an Eligible Employee for all or part of a particular Year under a sales, production or other similar incentive plan or plans maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be considered in determining the amount of any Award allocated to such Eligible Employee for the same Year under the Plan.<BR>

Subject to the provisions of this Section 7 and to such other conditions and Administrative Guidelines as the Committee may in accordance with the Plan prescribe, an Award shall be paid to the Eligible Employee in cash, either in a lump sum or in installments, at such time or times, and subject to such other conditions, as the Committee or the chief executive officer of the Company may determine.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Withholding</U>.  No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of an Eligible Employee for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, the Corporation shall withhold any and all taxes required by any governmental authority to be withheld by the Company or a Subsidiary.  The payment to any such governmental authority of an amount so withheld shall be deemed a payment of such amount to the Eligible Employee or his legal representatives.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Liability for Interest</U>.  Interest shall not be paid, and neither the Company nor the employing Subsidiary shall be liable for interest on, an Award (or portion of an Award) that is allocated, but not distributed.<BR>
<BR>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Change in Fiscal Year<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a change in the Corporation's fiscal year, the Plan shall continue, but there shall be a prorated adjustment of Net Capital to take into account the change in the fiscal year to a period of less than (or more than) 12 months.  Thereafter, the Plan shall continue in effect and apply to each subsequent full fiscal year of the Corporation.  <BR>

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control, Eligible Employees as of the date of such Change in Control shall be entitled to receive payment of Awards in accordance with this Section 10.  For purposes of this Section 10, with respect to the applicable Plan Year, each individual whose employment terminated during such Plan Year as a result of Retirement, Disability or death and who was an Eligible Employee at the time of such termination shall be considered an Eligible Employee as of the date of such Change in Control and shall be entitled to a pro-rata Award (as determined under the applicable provisions of this Section 10), to the extent such individual has not previously received an Award with respect to the same period of service.<BR>

Awards provided for under this Section 10(c) shall be paid as promptly as practicable, but not more than 90 days, after such Change in Control.<BR>

Each individual, whose employment terminated prior to the Change in Control as a result of Retirement, Disability or death and who was an Eligible Employee at the time of such termination, shall be paid, within 90 days following the date of the Change in Control, an Award for such Plan Year at least equal to the product of (A) the individual's Target Bonus Percentage multiplied by (B) the individual's Annualized Base Salary at the rate in effect immediately before the date of such termination, and further multiplied by (C) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in such Plan Year through the date of such termination of employment, and the denominator of which is 12.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Due to Death, Disability or Retirement after the Change in Control</U>.  Each individual, whose employment terminated during the Plan Year after the Change in Control as a result of Retirement, Disability or death and who was an Eligible Employee at the time of such termination, shall be paid, within 90 days following such termination of employment, an Award for such Plan Year at least equal to the product of (A) the individual's Target Bonus Percentage multiplied by (B) the individual's Annualized Base Salary at the rate in effect immediately before the date of such termination (or, if higher, the Change in Control) and further multiplied by (C) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in such Plan Year through the date of such termination of employment, and the denominator of which is 12.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Eligible Employees Whose Employment Continues through the end of the Plan Year of the Change in Control</U>.  Each individual who was an Eligible Employee immediately before the date of the Change in Control and continues to be employed at the end of the Plan Year in which the Change in Control occurs shall be paid, within 90 days following the end of such Plan Year (whether or not still employed at the time of such payment), an Award for the Plan Year in which the Change in Control occurs at least equal to the greater of (A) the amount equal to the product of (x) the individual's Target Bonus Percentage multiplied by (y) the individual's Annualized Base Salary at the rate in effect immediately before the date of such Change in Control, or (B) the amount equal to the Award allocated to such Eligible Employee as determined in accordance with Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Plan for such Plan Year based upon the Company's actual performance for such Plan Year.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Change of Control Before the Determination of Eligible Employees and Target Bonus Percentages for the Plan Year</U>.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a Change in Control occurs before the Committee or the chief executive officer of the Company has designated the Eligible Employees and Target Bonus Percentages for the Plan Year in accordance with Section 5, the Eligible Employees and Target Bonus Percentages designated by the Committee or the chief executive officer of the Company for the immediately preceding Plan Year shall be deemed to be the Eligible Employees and Target Bonus Percentages for the current Plan Year.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment of Deferred Amounts</U>.  Upon a Change in Control, any positive employee balance remaining in the deferred bonus account of an Eligible Employee established pursuant to the Company's annual bonus or incentive plans shall be paid within 90 days after such Change in Control.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Duplication of Benefits</U>.  Depending upon the date on which a Change in Control occurs, an Eligible Employee may be entitled to receive an Award (or partial Award) under Section 10(b) or Section 10(c) and under Section 10(d).  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall an Eligible Employee be paid an Award (or partial Award) under this Section 10, if payment thereof would be duplicative of amounts of annual incentive compensation with respect to the same period of service previously paid or payable to the Eligible Employee, whether pursuant to the terms of this Plan, another plan of the Corporation or an individual employment or severance agreement between the Eligible Employee and the Corporation, and any amounts payable under this Section 10 shall be reduced or offset by any such duplicate payments.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Not a Limitation on Awards</U>.  This Section 10 is intended to establish the minimum Awards payable to Eligible Employees in the event of a Change in Control, and nothing in this Section 10 shall preclude the payment of Awards under the Plan that are larger than those guaranteed to be paid under this Section 10.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Legal Fees</U>.  If an individual who is eligible for an Award or Awards under this Section  institutes any legal action in seeking to obtain or enforce any  right or benefit provided by this Section 10, the Company shall promptly reimburse such individual for all reasonable costs and expenses relating to such legal action, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred by such individual, unless a court or other finder of fact having jurisdiction thereof makes a determination that the individual's position was frivolous.  The Company's obligations under this Section 10(h) shall survive the termination of this Plan.<BR>
<BR>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Termination, Suspension and Amendment<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors may terminate, suspend or amend the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no provision of the Plan or the Administrative Guidelines for the Plan relating to a Change in Control, nor any definition of any defined term used in any provision relating to a Change in Control, may be terminated, suspended or amended after the occurrence of a Change in Control.  No such termination, suspension or amendment of the Plan shall adversely affect any right or obligation with respect to an Award theretofore allocated, or, after the occurrence of a Change in Control, an Eligible Employee or a Target Bonus Percentage theretofore designated, including, without limitation, the right to receive payment of Awards in accordance with Section 10 above.<BR>
<BR>
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Unfunded Plan Status<BR>
<BR>
</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan.  All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Corporation, and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment.  No employee or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Corporation as a result of receiving or being eligible to receive an Award under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) create one or more grantor trusts, the assets of which are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, to assist it in accumulating funds to pay its obligations under the Plan.  <BR>
<BR>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miscellaneous<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>.  No Award shall become an obligation or liability of, or be recourse to, any member of the Committee, the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer of the Company or any other officer or employee of the Corporation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment Status</U>.  The Plan shall not constitute a contract of employment, and adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan shall in all respects be governed by the laws of New Jersey, without reference to principles of conflict of law.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Transferable</U>.  Awards under the Plan are not transferable, except by will or by laws of descent and distribution. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Successors</U>.  This Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Plan if no succession had taken place.  In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  The term "Company," as used in this Plan, shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to the business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused its duly authorized officers to execute this Vulcan Materials Company Management Incentive Plan this 13th day of December, 2002.<BR>
