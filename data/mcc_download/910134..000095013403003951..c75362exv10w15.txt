                BELDEN INC. ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN (SUMMARY)

The Belden Inc. Annual Cash Incentive Plan provides for an annual bonus, and is
part of the cash component of management's total compensation (the other cash
component being base salary, another cash component, effective starting January
1, 2003, is associated with the Long-Term Cash Performance Plan). The bonus
criteria for the CEO are based solely on the attainment of Company-based
financial objectives, with 33% of the weight assigned to return on capital and
67% to earnings per share. For members of management other than the CEO, the
annual incentive bonus is based upon individual performance and the attainment
of Company-based financial objectives, with the weight assigned to each as
follows: 53% earnings per share; 27% return on capital; and 20% individual
performance.

The Compensation Committee establishes the performance goals at the beginning of
the year. The Company's overall financial performance determines the size of the
bonus pool to be distributed to the members of management participating in the
program. The annual incentive bonuses are calculated by the Committee as a
percentage of the management members' base salary.
