otherwise not subject to disallowance as deductions under Code Section 280G, in the

          <U>Legal Fees and Other Expenses</U>. In the event that a claim for payment or
          benefits under this Agreement is disputed, the Executive shall be reimbursed for

          10% per annum on the amount of any past due payment obligations under Sections
          6.3 from the date any such payment was due until the earlier of the date of

          against AAI and/or the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<U>Confidential Information</U>. The Executive shall not, during the Term of Employment
and thereafter, without the prior express written consent of AAI and/or the Corporation,
disclose any confidential information, knowledge or data relating to AAI, the Corporation,
or any Affiliate of either and their respective businesses, which (a) was obtained by the
Executive in the course of the Executive&#146;s employment with AAI and the Corporation,
and (b) which is not information, knowledge or data otherwise in the public domain (other
than by reason of a breach of this provision by the Executive), unless required to do so
by a court of law or equity or by any governmental agency or other authority. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2
<U>No Solicitation</U>. The Executive hereby agrees that, if her employment hereunder is
terminated by AAI and the Corporation for Cause or by the Executive within one year
following the date of a Change in Control for Good Reason, she shall not, for twelve (12)
months after the Date of Termination, directly or indirectly, divert, solicit or take away
the patronage of (a) any customers or agents of the Corporation, AAI or any Affiliate of
either as of the relevant Date of Termination, or (b) any prospective customers or agents
of the Corporation, AAI or any Affiliate whose business the Corporation and/or AAI was
actively soliciting on the relevant Date of Termination, and with which the Executive had
business contact while employed by the Corporation and AAI. The Executive agrees that,
under the circumstances and conditions described above and for the same period of time,
the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, induce or solicit any employees or agents
of the Corporation, AAI or any Affiliate of either to leave or terminate their employment
or agency relationship with the Corporation or AAI. The Corporation and AAI agrees that
(i) any announcement made by the Executive, at any press conference or in any press
release or through individual notices, shall not, in and of itself, constitute an attempt
directly or indirectly to induce, divert, solicit or take away customers or employees,
(ii) any such announcement creates no presumption with respect to any such inducement,
diversion, solicitation or taking, and (iii) in all cases both the burden of production of
evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to any allegations or claims
that this Section 10.2 has been breached or violated by the Executive shall be borne by
AAI and the Corporation. Executive agrees that all restrictions and agreements contained
in this Section 10, including without limitation, those relating to duration and
restricted territory, are necessary and fundamental to the protection of the business of
AAI, the Corporation or any Affiliate, and are reasonable and valid, and all defenses to
the strict enforcement thereof by Executive are hereby waived. Executive agrees that the
remedy at law for such breach of this Agreement will be inadequate, and that the damages
from such breach are not readily susceptible to being measured in monetary terms.
Accordingly, Executive agrees that upon breach of this Section 10, AAI, the Corporation or
any Affiliate shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary
order restraining any threatened further breach. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit AAI&#146;s, the Corporation&#146;s or any Affiliate&#146;s remedies at law or in
equity for any breach by Executive or any of the provisions of this Agreement that may be
pursued or availed of by AAI, the Corporation or any Affiliate. </FONT></P>

<U>The Executive</U>. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and, without the prior
express written consent of AAI and the Corporation, shall not be assignable by the
Executive, except that the Executive&#146;s rights to receive any compensation or benefits
under this Agreement may be transferred or disposed of pursuant to testamentary
disposition, intestate succession or pursuant to a domestic relations order. This

require any successor to all or substantially all of the Corporation&#146;s and its
Affiliates&#146; business and/or assets, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
consolidation, acquisition of stock, or otherwise, by an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same manner and to the same extent as AAI and the Corporation would be required to
perform if no such succession had taken place. </FONT></P>

          <U>Indemnification</U>. AAI and the Corporation agree that if the Executive is
          made a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or
          proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a
          &#147;Proceeding&#148;), by reason of the fact that she is or was a director or
          officer of AAI, the Corporation, and/or any Affiliate of either or is or was
          serving at the request of the Corporation, AAI and/or any Affiliate as a
          director, officer, member, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
          partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without
          limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether or not the
          basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
          director, officer, member, employee or agent while serving as a director,
          officer, member, employee or agent, she shall be indemnified and held harmless
          by AAI and the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law,
          as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all Expenses incurred or
          suffered by the Executive in connection therewith, and such indemnification
          shall continue as to the Executive even if the Executive has ceased to be an
          officer, director or agent, or is no longer employed by AAI and the Corporation
          and shall inure to the benefit of her heirs, executors and administrators;
          provided, however, that Executive shall not be indemnified for any act or
          omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. </FONT></P>
