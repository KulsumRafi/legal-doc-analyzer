<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund covenants and agrees to pay to

investment advice, material and other services furnished, for the use of all
facilities and equipment and for all expenses paid or reimbursed by Investment

Investment Adviser may in the future render
investment advice and other services to other investment companies, which may or
may not, have investment policies and investments similar to those of Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investment Adviser and or one or more of its members, managers, employees or
agents may manage its own investments and those of its subsidiaries and
affiliates, if any.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment Adviser and or one or more of its members,
managers, employees or agents shall be free to render such investment advice and
other services and Fund hereby consents thereto.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither this Contract,

shall be invalidated or in any way affected by the fact that directors,
officers, employees, agents or shareholders of Fund are or may be interested in
Investment Adviser, or any successor or assignee thereof, as members, managers,
employees, agents or otherwise; that members, managers, employees and or agents
of Investment Adviser are or may be interested in Fund as directors, officers,
employees, agents, shareholders or otherwise; or that Investment Adviser, or any

regulation, exemption or order of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any notice under this
Contract shall be given in writing and shall be

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment Adviser agrees
that no member, manager, employee or agent of
Investment Adviser will act for, or on behalf of, Fund with himself as principal
or agent, or with any corporation or partnership in which he may have a
financial interest, except that this shall not prohibit:<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, managers, employees or agents of Investment Adviser from
   having a financial interest in Fund or in Investment Adviser.<BR>

     dealer, one or more of whose shareholders, partners, directors, officers,

     Adviser, provided such transactions are handled in the capacity of broker
     only and provided commissions charged do not exceed customary brokerage
     charges for such services.<BR><BR>

that, except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, neither it nor any of its  members, managers, employees or agents
shall, at any time during the period of this Contract, make, accept or receive,
directly or indirectly, any fees, profits or emoluments of any character in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities (except shares issued by
Fund) or other assets by or for Fund.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors of
Fund may adopt such provisions and obtain
such insurance as they deem to be in the best interests of Fund to indemnify and
hold harmless the directors, officers and employees of Fund and the members,
managers and employees of Investment Adviser against liability for their acts or
omissions on behalf of Fund, except those acts or omissions involving willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their
obligations or duties to Fund; provided, however, that such insurance provides
merely for payment to Fund of any damages caused by such persons and for
subrogation of the insurer to the rights of Fund to recover from such persons.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;PHAM has the right to copy
and use for any purpose whatsoever, all
mailing or shareholder lists generated during its term as, or in the course of
its services as, investment adviser to Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund may not otherwise disclose
such lists, except as it may be required to do so by law.<BR><BR>

Fund further agrees to arrange, to the extent practical, for the collection of
this fee.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this
Contract shall be held or made invalid,
illegal or unenforceable by any judicial decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remaining provisions of this Contract shall not be affected thereby and
shall remain in full force and effect as if the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had not been included herein.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.</P>

terminated by either party as hereinafter provided, except that such continuance
thereafter shall be specifically approved as to any Portfolio of Fund at least
annually:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;by the Board of Directors of Fund or by a vote of the majority of
the outstanding voting shares of that Portfolio; and&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;by the vote of a
majority of the directors who are not parties to this Contract or interested
persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
voting on such approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this paragraph, the term &#147;interested person&#148;

any such termination shall be made without the payment of any penalty, and
provided further that such termination may be effected on behalf of any
Portfolio of Fund, either by the Board of Directors of Fund or by a vote of the
majority of the outstanding voting shares of that Portfolio.<BR><BR>

or a special meeting duly called for that purpose, of sixty-seven percent (67%)
or more of such shares present at such meeting if the holders of more than fifty
percent (50%) of such outstanding voting shares are present or represented by
proxy at the meeting, or more than fifty percent (50%) of such outstanding
shares, whichever is less.&nbsp;&nbsp;During such times as Fund issues two or more classes
or series of stock, such matters shall be deemed to be effectively acted upon
with respect to any such class or series if a majority of the outstanding voting
shares of such class or series votes for the approval of such matter,
notwithstanding: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;that such matter has not been approved by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding  voting shares of any other class or series affected
by such matter; and (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;that such matter has not been approved by the vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting shares of Fund.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract shall
