================================================================================
GENERAL TERMS

INTERPRETATION


Definitions of terms printed like this are at the end of these General Terms
before the Schedules.

1.       THE FACILITY

1.1      GE Capital agrees to provide the company with a loan facility in
         Australian dollars of an amount not exceeding the facility limit. The
         facility limit is an overall collective limit which.

2.       USING THE FACILITY


DRAWINGS

2.1      The company need not use the facility. However, if the company wants to
         use the facility, it may do so by one or more drawings.

REQUESTING A DRAWING

2.2      If the company wants a drawing, the company agrees to give a drawdown
         notice signed by an authorised officer of the company to GE Capital by
         11am on the business day it wants the drawing and GE Capital agrees to
         compare the signature of the authorised officer on the drawdown notice
         against the specimen signature certificate provided to it.

EFFECT OF A DRAWDOWN NOTICE

2.3      A drawdown notice is effective when GE Capital actually receives it in
         legible form. An effective drawdown notice is irrevocable unless the
         company advises GE Capital in writing that the company no longer
         requires a drawing and at that time GE Capital has not taken any steps
         to make the drawing available which GE Capital cannot rescind or
         reverse without GE Capital incurring a loss.

CONDITIONS TO FIRST DRAWING

2.4      Before the company requests the first drawing, the company must:

         (a)      ensure that GE Capital receives every item listed in Schedule
                  1 in form and substance satisfactory to GE Capital; and

         (b)      ensure that GE Capital receives all other documents required
                  by GE Capital to verify the items in Schedule 1 in form and
                  substance satisfactory to GE Capital.

2.5      The company must ensure that the information contained in all
         transaction documents is true, complete and not misleading or deceptive
         and discloses all matters material to GE Capital. Before GE Capital is
         obliged to provide any financial accommodation, it must be satisfied as
         to those matters. GE Capital is entitled to rely on the items in
         Schedule 1 and the information contained in them without further
         enquiry.

2.6      Any transaction document required to be certified must be certified by
         a secretary or a director of the relevant entity as being true,
         complete and not misleading or deceptive as at the time of
         certification and at the date of this agreement.

2.7      GE Capital agrees to notify the company as soon as practicable after GE
         Capital is satisfied that the conditions to first drawing are
         satisfied. To the extent that the company is unable to secure a
         landlord acknowledgement referred to in item 17 of Schedule 1 by the
         date that the first drawing is required, GE Capital agrees to hold, as
         a reserve against Excess Availability, an amount representing rent for
         a three month period for each of the properties that are occupied by
         the company at which eligible inventory is located that the company has
         not procured a landlord acknowledgement for the period that the
         acknowledgement is not in place.

CONDITIONS TO ALL DRAWINGS

2.8      GE Capital need not provide any financial accommodation unless:

         (a)      it is to be provided prior to the maturity date set out in the
                  Details; and

         (b)      GE Capital is satisfied that providing the drawing will not
                  result in a breach of clause 3.1; and

         (c)      GE Capital has received a drawdown notice in respect of it;
                  and

         (d)      GE Capital is satisfied that the representations and
                  warranties in clause 12 ("Representations and warranties") and
                  the statements in the drawdown notice are true, complete and
                  not misleading at the date of the drawdown notice and at the
                  drawdown date; and

         (e)      GE Capital is satisfied that no event of default has occurred
                  (other than one which has either been waived by GE Capital or
                  remedied) and no event of default would result from the
                  provision of the financial accommodation.


BENEFIT OF CONDITIONS

2.9      Each condition precedent to drawing is for the sole benefit of GE
         Capital and may be waived or modified by GE Capital.

3.1      The total of the current drawings and the letter of credit liability at

         (b)      the aggregate borrowing base at that time.

3.2      If the total of the current drawings and letter of credit liability
         exceeds the limits set out in clause 3.1, the company agrees to
         immediately repay to GE Capital so much of the current drawings or
         cancel or repay a letter of credit equal to the excess.

4.       INTEREST


INTERPRETATION

4.1      In this clause 4, references to the company in respect of a current
         drawing are references to the company in whose name the current drawing
         is made.


INTEREST CHARGES

4.2      The company agrees to pay interest on the daily balance of each current
         drawing. The interest charge for each day is calculated by applying the
         interest rate to the daily balance of the current drawing on the basis
         of a 360 day year. The interest rate for any day will be determined on
         the first business day of the calendar month in which the day falls.

INTEREST PAYMENT

4.3      On each interest payment date the company agrees to pay GE Capital the
         interest which has accrued from and including the first day of the
         calendar month of the preceding month up to and including the last day
         of that calendar month.

5.       PAYMENTS


REPAYMENT

5.1      The company agrees to pay to GE Capital all cash receipts, by way of
         deposit into a controlled account. To the extent not already paid, each
         company agrees to repay to GE Capital the total of the current drawings
         and on the maturity date.


PREPAYMENT

5.2      The company may prepay a current drawing at any time. The facility
         limit is not reduced by the amounts prepaid under this clause 5.2.

MANNER OF PAYMENT

5.3      The obligor agrees to make payments under each transaction document to
         GE Capital on the due date (or, if that is not a business day, on the
         next business day) in Australian dollars in immediately available funds
         without set-off or counterclaim and without any deduction in respect of
         taxes (unless prohibited by law) into the account nominated by GE
         Capital. The obligor satisfies a payment obligation only when GE
         Capital receives the amount.


PAYMENT APPLICATION

5.4      A payment under a transaction document will be applied by GE Capital on
         the next business day after it is actually received by GE Capital in
         the account nominated by GE Capital only for the purpose of calculating
         interest.


CONVERSION OF CURRENCY

5.5      All payments by the obligors under this agreement must be made in
         Australian dollars. If GE Capital receives an amount in a currency
         other than Australian dollars:

         (a)      it may convert the amount received into Australian dollars
                  (even though it may be necessary to convert through a third
                  currency to do so) on the day and at the rates (including spot
                  rate, same day value rate or value tomorrow rate) as it
                  considers appropriate. It may deduct its usual costs in
                  connection with the conversion; and

         (b)      the obligor satisfies its obligation to pay in Australian
                  dollars only to the extent of the amount of Australian dollars
                  obtained from the conversion after deducting the costs of the
                  conversion.

5.6      Where GE Capital is obliged to make a payment under this agreement in a
         currency other than Australian dollars, the obligor must reimburse GE
         Capital for that payment in Australian dollars unless GE Capital
         specifies otherwise. For the purpose of calculating the amount payable
         in Australian dollars, GE Capital may:

         (a)      convert the amount payable into Australian dollars (even
                  though it may be necessary to convert through a third currency
                  to do so) on the day and at the rates (including spot rate,
                  same day value rate or value tomorrow rate) as it considers
                  appropriate. It may add its usual costs in connection with the
                  conversion in calculating the amount payable; and

         (b)      the obligor satisfies its obligation to make any payment under
                  this agreement only to the extent that the moneys received by
                  GE Capital are sufficient to pay the liability in the other
                  currency including the costs of the conversion to that
                  currency.


APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS

5.7      GE Capital will apply amounts paid by the obligor or on its behalf
         and/or to GE Capital from any controlled account, towards:

<PAGE>

         (a)      satisfying obligations under the transaction documents in the
                  manner GE Capital sees fit, unless the transaction documents
                  expressly provide otherwise; and

         (b)      satisfying any money owed by the obligor to any related entity
                  of GE Capital.

5.8      If there are no current drawings, no letter of credit liabilities and
         no money payable or to become payable in the future by the obligor to
         GE Capital or any of its related entities, GE Capital will at the
         written direction of the company, apply amounts paid by the obligor or
         on its behalf to an account of the company nominated by the company.

5.9      Once the facility has terminated (either through the effluxion of time
         or otherwise) and all current drawings and other money due and owing to
         GE Capital have been repaid, GE Capital will direct the bank that
         maintains the blocked account to transfer any credit balance in the
         blocked account to an account nominated by the company.

6.       CANCELLATION

6.1      The company may cancel or terminate the facility. It may do this if the
         company gives GE Capital at least 20 business days notice in writing.
         Once given, the notice is irrevocable. When the cancellation or
         termination takes effect, the total of the current drawings and all
         other amounts payable or to become payable in the future under the
         transaction documents are immediately due and payable including without
         limitation the early termination fee.

7.       FEES

7.1      The company agrees to pay GE Capital:

                  agreement;

<PAGE>

         (f)      the trade letter of credit amendment fee as specified in the
                  Details on the date of the amendment;

         (g)      the term letter of credit fee of 2.7% per annum on the face
                  value amount of any drawing under a term letter of credit
                  payable monthly in arrears (calculated on the basis specified
                  in the Details); and

         (h)      subject to the other terms of this agreement, the early
                  termination fee, if required under the Details, on the date on
                  which the facility is cancelled or terminated, (but only if
                  the facility is cancelled or terminated prior to the maturity
                  date) either voluntarily by the company or otherwise.

7.2      GE Capital agrees that, provided it has received the early termination
         fee, it waives its rights to take action against the company for loss
         of bargain damages or loss of yield.

8.       LOAN ACCOUNT

8.1      GE Capital agrees to maintain a loan account on its books to record:

         (a)      all current drawings;

         (b)      all other amounts due and payable by the obligor to GE Capital
                  under the transaction documents including but not limited to
                  interest, fees and amounts deemed to be current drawings;

         (c)      all payments made by or on behalf of the obligor or by means
                  of the locked box agreement or blocked account agreement; and

         (d)      all other debits and credits as provided for in the
                  transaction documents.

         The balance in the loan account is sufficient evidence (absent error)
         of the amounts due and owing to GE Capital by the obligors. However, a
         failure to record or an error in recording does not limit or otherwise
         affect an obligor's obligations under the transaction documents.

8.2      GE Capital agrees to provide the company with a monthly statement of
         transactions for the facility. Unless the company notifies GE Capital
         of any objection to any item in that statement (specifically describing
         the basis for the objection), within 120 days after the date of the
         statement, each item in the statement is (absent obvious error) prima
         facie evidence of the correctness of the item.

9.       WITHHOLDING TAX


PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL

9.1      If a law requires the obligor to deduct an amount in respect of taxes
         from a payment under any transaction document such that GE Capital
         would not actually receive on the due date the full amount provided for
         under the transaction document, then:

Facility Agreement-Daisytek Australia Pty Limited                       12/02/03
                              Page 11 of 79 Pages
<PAGE>

         (a)      the amount payable is increased so that, after making the
                  deduction and further deductions applicable to additional
                  amounts payable under this clause 9.1, GE Capital is entitled
                  to receive (at the time the payment is due) the amount it
                  would have received if no deductions had been required; and

         (b)      the obligor agrees to make the deductions; and

         (c)      the obligor agrees to pay the amounts deducted to the relevant
                  authority in accordance with applicable law and deliver the
                  copies of receipts to GE Capital.

10.      COMPENSATION FOR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES


COMPENSATION

10.1     The company agrees to compensate GE Capital on demand if, in GE
         Capital's opinion, any law or change in law taking effect after the
         date of this agreement, a change in any law's interpretation or
         application by an authority after the date of this agreement or
         compliance by GE Capital or any of its related entities with any such
         law, changed law or changed interpretation or application directly:

         (a)      increases the cost of the facility to GE Capital; or

         (b)      reduces any amount received or receivable by GE Capital, or
                  its effective return, in connection with the facility; or

         (c)      reduces GE Capital's return on capital allocated to the
                  facility, or its overall return on capital.

         Compensation need not be in the form of a lump sum and may be demanded
         as a series of payments. GE Capital agrees that this clause does not
         apply to an increased cost event such as a change in company tax rates
         or the introduction of other expenses that does not directly effect or
         increase the cost to GE Capital of providing financial accommodation
         under the Transaction Documents.

CALCULATION IN REASONABLE DETAIL

10.2     If GE Capital makes a demand under clause 10.1, it agrees to provide
         the company with reasonably detailed calculations of how the amount
         demanded has been ascertained. However, nothing in this clause 10.2
         obliges GE Capital to provide details of its business or tax affairs
         which it considers in good faith to be confidential.

MITIGATION

10.3     If requested by the company, in any case where clause 10.1 applies, GE
         Capital will use its reasonable endeavours to take such steps as may be
         reasonable and available to it to minimise the amount of any increased
         cost, reduction, loss of return or payment. Failure by GE Capital to do
         so does not release the company from its obligations under clause 10.1
         and the company agrees that no right of action arises as a result.

<PAGE>

10.4     Nothing in clause 10.3 obliges GE Capital to incur any additional costs
         or to take any steps which, in GE Capital's opinion, could be
         detrimental to its interests, whether by way of an economic, legal or
         regulatory disadvantage or in any other way.

10.5     The company must reimburse GE Capital on demand for any costs incurred
         in taking any steps under clause 10.3.

11.      ILLEGALITY OR IMPOSSIBILITY


GE CAPITAL'S RIGHT TO SUSPEND OR CANCEL

11.1     This clause 11 applies if GE Capital determines that:

         (a)      a change in a law; or

         (b)      a change in the interpretation or administration of a law by
                  an authority; or

         (c)      a new law taking effect after the date of this agreement,

         makes it (or will make it) illegal or impossible for GE Capital to
         fund, provide, or continue to fund or provide, financial accommodation
         under the transaction documents. In these circumstances, GE Capital, by
         giving a notice to the company, may suspend or cancel some or all of GE
         Capital's obligations under this agreement as indicated in the notice.


EXTENT AND DURATION

11.2     The suspension or cancellation:

         (a)      must apply only to the extent necessary to avoid the
                  illegality or impossibility; and

         (b)      in the case of suspension, may continue only for so long as
                  the illegality or impossibility continues.


NOTICE REQUIRING REPAYMENT

11.3     If the illegality or impossibility relates to a current drawing, GE
         Capital, by giving a notice to the company, may require repayment of
         all or part of that current drawing. The company agrees to repay the
         amount specified within 5 business days after receiving the notice.

FEES

11.4     The early termination fee is not payable by the company if the early
         repayment occurs solely because of a cancellation or suspension under
         this clause, and provided no event of default has occurred.

11.5     The unused facility fee is not payable by the company for that part of
         the facility that is cancelled or suspended under this clause, and
         provided no event of default has occurred or occurs, for the period of
         the suspension or cancellation.

REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNITY

16.1     The company agrees to pay or reimburse GE Capital and indemnifies GE
         Capital for and against loss, liability and costs it suffers or incurs,
         on demand for:

         (a)      GE Capital's costs in connection with:

                  (i)      the negotiation, preparation, execution, stamping and
                           registration of all transaction documents; and

                  (ii)     it being satisfied that conditions to drawing have
                           been met; and

                  (iii)    the general on-going administration of the facility
                           (including giving and considering consents, waivers
                           and releases); and

         (b)      GE Capital's costs in otherwise acting in connection with the
                  transaction documents, such as enforcing or preserving rights
                  (or considering enforcing or preserving them) or doing
                  anything in connection with any enquiry by an authority
                  involving the company or any of its related entities; and

         (c)      taxes and fees (including registration fees) and fines and
                  penalties in respect of fees paid or that GE Capital

                  transaction document or a payment or receipt or any other
                  transaction contemplated by any transaction document or any
                  supply of anything by GE Capital to the company. However, the
                  company need not pay a fine or penalty in connection with
                  taxes or fees to the extent that it has placed GE Capital in
                  sufficient cleared funds for GE Capital to be able to pay the
                  taxes or fees by the due date; and

         (d)      if GST has application to any supply made under or in
                  connection with this agreement or a transaction document, in
                  addition to any other consideration expressed as payable
                  elsewhere in this agreement or a transaction document, an
                  additional amount on account of GST, such amount to be
                  calculated by multiplying the amount or consideration payable
                  by the company for the relevant supply by the prevailing GST
                  rate (taking into account any input tax credit actually
                  received by GE Capital which in GE Capital's opinion relates
                  to a GST payment made in respect of any supply made under or
                  in connection with this agreement). Any amount payable on
                  account of GST by the company under this clause must be
                  calculated without any deduction or set off of any other
                  amount (other than as expressly permitted under this clause)
                  and is payable by the company on demand by GE Capital whether
                  the demand is by means of an invoice or otherwise; and

         (e)      if GE Capital is unable to obtain a full input tax credit for
                  an amount paid on account of GST by GE Capital to another
                  person in respect of a supply made by another person to GE
                  Capital in respect of this agreement or a transaction document
                  or matters arising under this agreement or a transaction
                  document, an amount equal to the input tax credit to which GE
                  Capital is not entitled under the GST legislation.

CURRENCY CONVERSION ON JUDGMENT DEBT

16.5     If a judgment or proof of debt for an amount in connection with a
         transaction document is expressed in a currency other than Australian
         dollars, then the company indemnifies GE Capital against:

         (a)      any difference arising from converting the other currency if
                  the rate of exchange used by GE Capital under clause 5.5
                  ("Conversion of currency") for converting currency when it
                  receives a payment in the other currency is less favourable to
                  GE Capital than the rate of exchange used for the purpose of
                  the judgment or acceptance of proof of debt; and

         (b)      the costs of conversion.

CERTIFICATE BY GE CAPITAL

16.6     A statement or certificate given by GE Capital setting out the amount
         of any loss, liability or costs incurred or suffered by GE Capital
         (including the extent of GE Capital's entitlement to a full or reduced
         input tax credit for GST paid in respect of any matter contemplated in
         a transaction document) is, absent manifest error, final, binding and
         conclusive evidence against the obligor of the amount of that loss,
         liability or cost.

17.      INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS


OBLIGATION TO PAY

17.1     If the obligor fails to pay any amount under this agreement on the due
         date for payment, the obligor agrees to pay to GE Capital on demand
         interest on that amount at the default rate. The interest accrues from
         day to day from and including the due date up to but excluding the date
         of actual payment and is calculated on actual days elapsed and a year
         of 360 days.


COMPOUNDING

17.2     Interest payable under clause 17.1 ("Obligation to pay") which is not
         paid when due for payment may be added to the overdue amount by GE
         Capital at intervals which GE Capital determines from time to time or,
         if no determination is made, every 30 days. Interest is payable on the
         increased overdue amount at the default rate in the manner set out in
         clause 17.1 ("Obligation to pay").


INTEREST FOLLOWING JUDGMENT

17.3     If a liability becomes merged in a judgment, then the company agrees to
         pay GE Capital on demand interest on the amount of that liability as an
         independent obligation. This interest:

         (a)      accrues from the date the liability becomes due for payment
                  both before and after the judgment until the liability is
                  paid; and

         (b)      is calculated at the rate that is the higher of the judgment
                  rate and the default rate.

         to incur expense or make payment before enforcing a right of indemnity
         conferred by this agreement.

                  proceedings or by any stock exchange.

FUrTHER STEPS

22.14    The obligor agrees to do anything GE Capital asks (such as obtaining
         consents, signing and producing documents and getting documents
         completed and signed) to bind the obligor and any other person intended
         to be bound under the transaction documents.


INCONSISTENT LAW

22.15    To the extent permitted by law, each transaction document prevails to
         the extent it is inconsistent with any law.


SUPERVENING LEGISLATION

22.16    Any present or future legislation which operates to vary the
         obligations of an obligor in connection with a transaction document
         with the result that GE Capital's rights, powers or remedies are
         adversely affected (including by way of delay or postponement) is
         excluded except to the extent that its exclusion is prohibited or
         rendered ineffective by law.


TIME OF THE ESSENCE

22.17    Time is of the essence in any transaction document in respect of an
         obligation of the obligor to pay money.


APPLICABLE LAW

22.18    The transaction documents are governed by the law in force in New South
         Wales. The obligor and GE Capital submit to the non-exclusive
         jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales.


SERVING DOCUMENTS

22.19    Without preventing any other method of service, any document in a court
         action may be served on a party by being delivered to or left at that
         party's address for service of notices under clause 21 ("Notices").

         party.

SEVERANCE

         document is severable no matter how they are linked. If any word,

SCHEDULE 5 - LETTERS OF CREDIT (CLAUSE 2.11)


REQUESTING A LETTER OF CREDIT


         s5.1     If the company wants a letter of credit to be issued, the
                  company must have excess availability in excess of the face
                  value amount of the letter of credit requested. The company
                  agrees to give a letter of credit application to GE Capital no
                  later than 2 business days before the proposed issuance date.
                  The letter of credit application must contain:

                  (oo)     details of the beneficiary of the requested letter of
                           credit; and

                  (pp)     the proposed issuance date of the requested letter of
                           credit (which must be no later than 2 business days
                           after the date of the letter of credit application);
                           and

                  (qq)     the proposed expiry date (if any) of the requested
                           letter of credit which must be no later than one year
                           after the issuance date without GE Capital's written
                           consent, and must not be any later than the maturity
                           date; and

                  (rr)     the face value amount in Australian dollars of the
                           requested letter of credit (which must be an amount
                           which when added to the face value amount of each
                           current LC must not exceed the letter of credit
                           facility limit and must not exceed the amount of any
                           excess availability calculated at that time); and

                  (ss)     any other information GE Capital may reasonably
                           require from time to time.

                  GE Capital is not obliged to incur LC obligations.


LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY LIMIT


         s5.2     The total amount of the letter of credit liability which is
                  payable or to become payable in respect of all letters of
                  credit issued under this agreement must not exceed the letter
                  of credit facility limit.

EFFECT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATION


         s5.3   A letter of credit application is effective when GE Capital
                actually receives it in legible form. An effective letter of
                credit application is irrevocable unless the company advises GE
                Capital in writing that the company no longer requires a letter
                of credit and at that time GE Capital has not taken any steps to
                make the letter of credit available which GE Capital cannot
                rescind or reverse without GE Capital incurring a loss.

<PAGE>

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ISSUE OF AN LC


         s5.4   The company must ensure to GE Capital's reasonable satisfaction
                that all requirements of the letter of credit regarding a
                request for payment under the letter of credit are satisfactory
                to GE Capital and the issuing bank.

PAYMENT OF AN LC


         s5.5   If a letter of credit is called or if any letter of credit
                liability arises or is paid by GE Capital, then the amount
                called, payable or paid must be immediately repaid to GE
                Capital. GE Capital may debit the company's loan account with
                the amount required to be paid. The debit is deemed to be a
                current drawing under the facility of the amount called payable
                or paid. The company acknowledges its indebtedness to GE Capital
                for the amount of that current drawing.


         s5.6   If any letter of credit is issued in a currency other than
                Australian dollars, GE Capital may convert the amount of the
                letter of credit liability into Australian dollars (even though
                it may be necessary to convert through a third currency to do
                so) for the purpose of calculating the amount of the letter of
                credit liability on the day and at the rates it considers
                appropriate and may add its usual costs in connection to the
                conversion to Australian dollars.


         s5.7     Without prejudice to any other power of GE Capital, upon or at
                  any time after the occurrence of an event of default, GE
                  Capital may require the company by notice to pay to GE Capital
                  cash cover equal to 105% of the face value amount of each
                  current LC. Upon receiving the notice the company must
                  immediately pay the cash cover specified in the notice to GE
                  Capital in immediately available funds and in Australian
                  dollars. The additional 5% of the face value amount of each
                  current LC ("Buffer") is to be applied by GE Capital against
                  any costs relating to foreign exchange conversion. To the
                  extent that such costs are less than the amount representing
                  the Buffer, GE Capital shall repay the balance of the cash
                  cover to the company.

         s5.8     If any LC obligations are subsisting on the maturity date, the
                  company must either immediately:

                  (tt)     cause each current LC to be returned to the issuer
                           and cancelled; or

                  (uu)     pay to GE Capital, in immediately available funds, an
                           amount equal to 105% of the aggregate amount of the
                           face value amount of each current LC to be held by GE
                           Capital as cash collateral in an account of GE
                           Capital; or

                  (vv)     procure the delivery to GE Capital of a bank
                           guarantee in form and substance and in currencies
                           approved by GE Capital in an amount equal to 105% of
                           the aggregate amount of the face value amount of
                           current LCs.


         s5.9     Without prejudice to any other power of GE Capital, if any LC
                  obligations are subsisting on the maturity date or on the
                  occurrence of any event of default, GE Capital may pay the
                  beneficiary all amounts payable or to become payable in the
                  future under the letter of credit.

SCHEDULE 7 - GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY (CLAUSE 18.1)

GUARANTEE

         s7.1     The guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
                  payment to GE Capital of the guaranteed money and guarantees
                  to GE Capital the due performance by the company of the
                  company's obligations to GE Capital under the transaction
                  documents as a principal obligation. If the company does not
                  pay the guaranteed money on time and in accordance with the
                  transaction documents, then the guarantor agrees to pay the
                  guaranteed money to GE Capital on demand. A demand may be made
                  at any time and from time to time and whether or not GE
                  Capital has made demand on the company.


NATURE OF GUARANTEE

         s7.2     This guarantee is a continuing obligation and extends to all
                  of the guaranteed money.


INDEMNITY

         s7.3     The guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably indemnifies GE
                  Capital as a principal obligation against any liability or
                  loss (including consequential or economic loss) arising, and
                  any costs GE Capital suffers or incurs:

                  (ww)     if an obligor does not, is not obliged to, or is
                           unable to, pay the guaranteed money in accordance
                           with the transaction documents; or

                  (xx)     if the guarantor is not obliged to pay GE Capital an
                           amount under clause s7.1 ("Guarantee"); or

                  (yy)     if GE Capital is obliged, or agrees, to pay an amount
                           to a trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator (of an
                           insolvent person) in connection with a payment by an
                           obligor (for example, GE Capital may have to, or may
                           agree to, pay interest on the amount); or

                  (zz)     if the guarantor defaults under this guarantee; or

                  (aaa)    in connection with any person exercising, or not
                           exercising, rights under this guarantee; or

                  (bbb)    if any obligor defaults under this agreement or any
                           transaction document; or

                  (ccc)    if the guaranteed money is not recoverable or
                           recovered by GE Capital from any obligor.


REINSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS

         s7.4     A trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator or controller or any other
                  person may ask GE Capital to refund a payment it has received
                  or otherwise repay money it has received in connection with
                  this guarantee the guaranteed money or the

<PAGE>

                  transactions documents. To the extent GE Capital is obliged
                  to, or agrees to, make a refund or repayment it may treat the
                  payment as if it had not been made. It is then entitled to its
                  rights against the guarantor under this guarantee as if the
                  payment had never been made. This applies despite anything in
                  this guarantee.


RIGHTS OF GE CAPITAL ARE PROTECTED

         s7.5     Rights given to GE Capital under this guarantee (and the
                  guarantor's liabilities under it) are not affected by any act
                  or omission by GE Capital or by anything else that might
                  otherwise affect them under law or otherwise, including:

                  (ddd)    the fact that it varies or replaces any arrangement
                           under which the guaranteed money is expressed to be
                           owing, such as by increasing the facility limit or
                           extending the term; or

                  (eee)    the fact that it releases the company or an obligor
                           or gives it a concession, such as more time to pay or
                           compromises any of the guaranteed money; or

                  (fff)    the fact that the company opens an account with it;
                           or

                  (ggg)    the fact it releases, loses the benefit of or does
                           not obtain any transaction document; or

                  (hhh)    the fact that it does not register any transaction
                           document which could be registered; or

                  (iii)    the fact that it releases any person who guarantees
                           any of the company's obligations; or

                  (jjj)    the fact that a person becomes a guarantor after the
                           date of this agreement; or

                  (kkk)    the fact that the obligations of any person who
                           guarantees any of the company's obligations may be
                           void or may not be enforceable; or

                  (lll)    the fact that any person who was intended to
                           guarantee any of the company's obligations does not
                           do so or does not do so effectively; or

                  (mmm)    the death, mental or physical disability or
                           insolvency of any person including an obligor; or

                  (nnn)    changes in the membership, name or business of any
                           person; or

                  (ooo)    any neglect, omission, default or delay of GE
                           Capital.


NO MERGER

         s7.6     This guarantee does not merge with or adversely affect, and is
                  not adversely affected by, any of the following:

                  (ppp)    any other guarantee, indemnity, or security interest,
                           or other right or remedy to which GE Capital is
                           entitled; or

                  (qqq)    a judgment which GE Capital obtains against the
                           guarantor in connection with the guaranteed money or
                           any other amount payable under this guarantee.


                GE Capital may still exercise rights under this guarantee as
                well as under the judgment, other guarantee, indemnity, security
                interest, or other right or remedy.


EXTENT OF GUARANTOR'S OBLIGATIONS

         s7.7     If more than one person is named as "guarantor" each of them
                  is liable for all the obligations under this guarantee both
                  separately on its own and jointly with any one or more other
                  persons named as "guarantor". This guarantee binds each person
                  who signs as "guarantor" even if another person who was
                  intended to sign does not sign it or is not bound by it.


GUARANTOR'S RIGHTS ARE SUSPENDED

         s.7.8    As long as any of the guaranteed money remains unpaid, the
                  guarantor may not, without GE Capital's written consent:

                           that it or any obligor or any other person has a
                           right of set-off subrogation or counterclaim against
                           GE Capital; or

                           this guarantee (for example, the guarantor may not
                           try to enforce any security interest GE Capital has
                           taken to ensure repayment of the guaranteed money);
                           or

                           of indemnity or any other claim, or enforce any right
                           against either of them; or

                  (vvv)    directly or indirectly withdraw or seek to withdraw
                           any money loaned by the guarantor to the company or
                           otherwise owing to the guarantor by the company or
                           accept or receive any property or payment of the
                           company or take any encumbrance or security interest

                  (www)    transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any claim
                           the guarantor may have against the company other than
                           by way of complete release or make or cause any other
                           person to claim, demand or bring an action against
                           the company directly or indirectly.

         Any money, property or other benefit received by the guarantor from the
                  company in contravention of this clause is received on the
                  basis that it is held on trust for GE Capital and will be paid
                  to GE Capital on receipt by the guarantor.

CROSS GUARANTEE

         s7.9     This guarantee takes effect as a cross-guarantee and
                  cross-indemnity when one or more of the company are the same
                  as one or more of the guarantor. In those circumstances it is

                  as if that person were:

                  (xxx)    the only person included in the definition of

                  have notified Bank or GE Capital thereof); (iv) failure of any

                  of Drafts and documents for payment directly.

         (c)      GE Capital may appoint any of its other related bodies
                  corporate as "Bank" at any time and any Bank may assign or

         Collateral, or modify the terms under which such Collateral is held, or

5.       RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AND SIMILAR COSTS.

         If Bank is now or hereafter becomes subject to any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with, or for
         the account of, or credit extended by, Bank, or any other condition is
         imposed upon Bank which imposes a cost upon Bank, and the result, in
         the determination of Bank is to increase the cost to Bank of
         maintaining a Credit or paying or funding the payment of any draft
         thereunder, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable,
         directly, by Bank hereunder, Applicant will pay to Bank upon demand
         such amounts required to compensate Bank for such increased cost or
         reduction. In making the determinations contemplated hereunder, Bank
         may make such estimates, assumptions, allocations and the like which
         Bank in good faith determines to be appropriate, but Bank's selection
         thereof, and Bank's determinations based thereon, shall be final and
         binding and conclusive upon Applicant absent manifest error.

6.       POSSESSION OF PROPERTY BY APPLICANT.

         If the Applicant obtains possession of goods or other property, if any,
         covered by the Credit, prior to the Bank's receipt and review of
         documents, then all discrepancies and other irregularities of said
         documents shall be deemed waived by the Applicant, and the Bank is
         authorized and directed to pay any Drafts drawn or purporting to be
         drawn upon the Credit.

7.       PARTIAL SHIPMENTS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise expressly stated in the Credit (i) partial
                  shipments may be made under the Credit, and the Bank may
                  honour the relative Drafts without inquiry regardless of any
                  apparent disproportion between the quantity shipped and the
                  amount of the relative Draft and the total amount of the
                  Credit and the total quantity to be shipped under the Credit,
                  and (ii) if the Credit specifies shipments in instalments
                  within stated periods and the shipper fails to ship in any
                  designated period, shipments of subsequent instalments may
                  nevertheless be made in their respective designated periods
                  and the Bank may honour the relative Drafts.

8.       EVENTS OF DEFAULT, REMEDIES; PRE-FUNDING.

         (a)      If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
                  GE Capital may declare all or any part of the Obligations
                  (including any such which may be contingent and not matured)
                  to be immediately due and payable. GE Capital may exercise any
                  other rights it may have under the Transaction Documents if an
                  Event of Default occurs.

         (b)      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Applicant
                  agrees that if: (a) any Event of Default or event which with
                  notice or lapse of time would become an Event of Default shall
                  have occurred; (b) GE Capital at any time and for any reason
                  reasonably deems itself or Bank to be insecure or the risk of
                  non-payment or non-performance of any of the Obligations to
                  have increased; or (c) in the event that the Credit is
                  denominated in a currency other than Dollars, GE Capital
                  determines that such currency is unavailable or that the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement are unlawful or
                  contrary to any regulations to which GE Capital or Bank may be
                  subject or that due to currency fluctuations the Dollar
                  Equivalent of the amount of a Credit exceeds the amount of
                  Dollars that Bank in its sole judgment expected to be its
                  maximum exposure under a Credit, then Applicant will upon

         this Agreement shall be enforceable against GE Capital or Bank unless
         in writing and signed by an officer of GE Capital, and unless it
         expressly refers to the provision affected, any such waiver shall be
         limited solely to the specific event waived. All rights granted GE
         Capital or Bank hereunder shall be cumulative and shall be
         supplementary of and in addition to those granted or available to GE
         Capital or Bank under applicable law and nothing herein shall be
         construed as limiting any such other right.

13.      CONTINUING AGREEMENT; TERMINATION.

         This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
         expiration of the Credit, but, notwithstanding any such expiration,
         this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until all
         Obligations then outstanding (whether absolute or contingent) shall
         have been paid in full and all rights of Bank hereunder shall have been
         satisfied or other arrangements for the securing of such rights
         satisfactory to Bank shall have been made.

         Customer if, in its discretion, GE Capital determines that the issuance

                  elsewhere as GE Capital may select and that such courts are
                  convenient forums therefor and submits to the personal
                  jurisdiction of such courts.

         (c)      Applicant waives personal service of process upon it and

17.      THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.

         Applicant hereby acknowledges that Bank may enforce its rights under
         this Agreement directly against the Applicant as if Bank were named
         herein as a party.

18.      GENERAL.

         (a)      If this Agreement is executed by two or more Applicants, they
                  shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.
