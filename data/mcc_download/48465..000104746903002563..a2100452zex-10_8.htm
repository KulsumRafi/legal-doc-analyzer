<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">This
Agreement, made and entered into this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, (&#147;Agreement&#148;), by and between
Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Company&#148;), and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#147;Indemnitee&#148;):</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS,
highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held
corporations as directors or in other capacities unless they are provided with
adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against
inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their
service to and activities on behalf of the corporation; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, the
Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) has determined that, in order
to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to
maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to
protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain
liabilities.&#160; Although the furnishing of
such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United
States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes
that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be
available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more
exclusions.&#160; At the same time,
directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business
enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming
litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would
have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, the
uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased
the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, the
Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining
such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company&#146;s stockholders
and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be
increased certainty of such protection in the future; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, it is
reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate
itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue
to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so
indemnified; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, this
Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the By-laws of the Company
and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, each
of Section&nbsp;145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and
the By-laws is nonexclusive, and therefore contemplates that contracts may be
entered into with respect to indemnification of directors, officers and
employees; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS,
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional
service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so
indemnified;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein,
the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.75in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Section&nbsp;1.&#160; <u>Services by Indemnitee</u>.&#160; Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director or
officer of the Company, and/or at the request of the Company, as a director or
officer of another Enterprise.&#160;
Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position
(subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by
operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under
this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position.&#160; This Agreement shall not be deemed an
employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and
Indemnitee.&#160; Indemnitee specifically
acknowledges that Indemnitee&#146;s employment with the Company (or any of its
subsidiaries), if any, is at will, and that Indemnitee may be discharged at any
time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided
in any written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any
of its subsidiaries), other applicable formal severance policies duly adopted
by the Board, or, with respect to service as a director or officer of the
Company, by the Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company&#146;s By-laws,
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.&#160; The foregoing notwithstanding, this
Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an
officer or director of the Company.</font></p>

Agreement and (b) (subject to the provisions of this Agreement) to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and as such law
may be amended from time to time.&#160; The

not be limited to, the rights set forth in the other Sections of this

all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with
such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if he acted in good

entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section&nbsp;4 but
subject to the provisions of this Agreement if, by reason of his Corporate
Status, he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any
Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its
favor.&#160; Pursuant to this Section but
subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be indemnified
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf
in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that, if applicable law so provides,
no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim,

adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which such Proceeding shall

Who is Wholly or Partly Successful</u>.&#160;
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent
that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a party to (or a
participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of
any Proceeding (including dismissal without prejudice), he shall be indemnified
to the maximum extent permitted by law against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.&#160; If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in
defense of such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to
one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the

incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each successfully resolved
claim, issue or matter.&#160; For purposes of
this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or
matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be
