         2.06 Assumed Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities.

               (a) On the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, perform

               (b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, except as

indemnified in accordance with Article X by Seller for, any liability or
obligation, direct or indirect, known or unknown, absolute, contingent or
accrued, with respect to the Asset Management Business, including liabilities
of any Seller Entity, any of their respective Subsidiaries or the Asset
Management Assets (the "Excluded Liabilities") including (i) any liability,
responsibility or obligation that is attributable to any Excluded Asset; (ii)
any liability, responsibility or obligation relating to the Asset Management
Assets or the Asset Management Business arising out of any event, circumstance
or condition occurring or existing prior to the Applicable Closing; (iii) any
liability, responsibility or obligation arising out of (A) any suit, action,
proceeding, arbitration, mediation, inquiry or investigation pending or
threatened as of, or arising out of any event, circumstance or condition
occurring or existing prior to, the Applicable Closing; or (B) any actual or
alleged violation of Law prior to the Applicable Closing; (iv) any Retained
Employee Liability; (v) except as expressly set forth in Section 3.02, any

any period or any portion of any period ending prior to the Applicable Closing
Date for such assets including any Taxes upon or arising out of the
distribution or other transfer by any Seller Entity to Seller or for the
account of any Affiliate of the Seller Investments as contemplated by Section
6.01. Subject to Section 2.09, Seller hereby agrees to pay, perform and
discharge when due, any and all of the Excluded Liabilities.

         2.07 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
Seller Entity shall sell or deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall not purchase or
acquire from any Seller Entity and neither Buyer Parent nor Buyer shall have
liability or obligation with respect to, (a) any Excluded Account, (b) except
as provided in Section 2.01, any Company names, marks, (c) asset management
services for Excluded Accounts, (d) asset management and private client
business or services for any directors, officers and employees of any Seller
Entity other than to the extent it is determined by Seller that such services
may be provided by Buyer to such directors, officers or employees under
Applicable Law or the relevant compliance manual and (e) any insurance policies
owned by Seller, excluding such policies, if any, which provide coverage to any
Fund (the "Excluded Assets"). Notwithstanding Section 2.01, Seller and Buyer
agree to cooperate in good faith to determine the appropriate manner and timing
of the transfer or assignment of the accounts of any Transferred Employees to
Buyer.

         2.08 Consent of Third Parties. To the extent that the sale,
conveyance, transfer or assignment of any Asset Management Asset or Equity
Interest requires the consent of a third party, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to consummate such sale, conveyance, transfer or
assignment if such consummation would constitute a breach or violation thereof
or adversely affect Buyer's rights thereunder. Seller agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts (with no obligation to pay any fee to any third party
from whom any consent or approval is sought or any costs and expenses of such
third party in providing such consent or approval) to obtain such consents
prior to the Applicable Closing Date in accordance with Sections 6.04 and 6.12.
Except with respect to any Client consents contemplated by Section 6.12, to the
extent that any such consent is not obtained prior to the Applicable Closing
Date, (i) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts (with no obligation to pay
any fee to any third party from whom any consent or approval is sought or any
costs and expenses of such third party in providing such consent or approval)
to (A) obtain any such consent after the Applicable Closing Date, (B) to the
extent reasonably practicable, provide or cause to be provided to Buyer the
benefits of any such Asset Management Asset or Equity Interest for which such
consent or waiver has not been obtained, (C) cooperate in any arrangement,
reasonable and lawful as to Seller and Buyer, designed to provide such benefits
to Buyer, (D) enforce for the account of Buyer any rights of Seller arising
from such Asset Management Asset or Equity Interest for which such consent has
not been obtained against the other party, including, without limitation, the
right to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof on the advice
of Buyer, and (E) Seller shall pay, defend, indemnify and hold Buyer harmless
from any liability suffered by Buyer as a result of any failure of Seller to
obtain such consent whether before or after the Applicable Closing Date; and
(ii) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to perform the obligations of
Seller arising under such Asset Management Asset or Equity Interest for which
such consent has not been obtained, to the extent that by reason of the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer has control over the
resources necessary to perform such obligations. Except with respect to any
Client consents contemplated by Section 6.12, nothing in this Section 2.08
shall be deemed (i) a waiver by Buyer of its rights to have received on or
before the Applicable Closing Date an effective assignment of all of the Asset
Management Assets and Equity Interests, (ii) a waiver by Buyer of its rights to
have each condition to each Applicable Closing set forth in Article VIII
satisfied on the Applicable Closing Date or (iii) to constitute an agreement to
exclude from the Asset Management Assets any properties, assets or rights
described under Section 2.01 or limit or affect the representations, warranties
and covenants of Seller Parent or any Seller Entity in this Agreement.

         2.09 Post-Closing Adjustment. Seller, Buyer Parent and Buyer agree
that (a) if there is a Net Profit, such Net Profit shall be for the benefit of
Seller and a payment shall be made by Buyer to Seller as soon as practicable
following (and subject to the occurrence of) the Final Closing Date solely to
the extent that Seller has not already received such Net Profit and (b) if
there is a Net Loss, Buyer shall make a payment to Seller as soon as
practicable following (and subject to the occurrence of) the Final Closing Date
equal to such Net Loss multiplied by the AA Transfer Percentage.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                RELATED MATTERS
                                ---------------

         3.01 [Reserved.]

         3.02 Employees; Employee Benefits.

               (a) Business Employees. Section 3.02(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all employees of the Asset
Management Business as of the date hereof other than any employees transferred
to Buyer at the Brokerage Closing Date (the "Business Employees") indicating
each such employee's title, employer and business unit. Effective as of the
Hire Date applicable to each Business Employee, such Business Employee shall
cease to be an employee of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer has offered employment to all Business Employees, in
accordance with Section 3.02(b), (i) in substantially the same position, (ii)
in the same city, (iii) with the same base salary, and (iv) with the same
vacation policy applicable to each such Business Employee as of the applicable
Hire Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer's offer to any Business Employee who is on short-term or
long-term disability or any approved leave of absence (each an "Inactive
Employee") as of the applicable Hire Date is conditioned on such Inactive
Employee's being ready and able to return to work within six months following
the applicable Hire Date, and such an Inactive Employee shall not become an
employee of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer unless and until they are ready and
able to work as of a date within six months of the applicable Hire Date. Prior
to the date Inactive Employees are hired by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer,
such Inactive Employees shall be retained as employees of Seller, but only for
such period as an individual on short-term or long-term disability or approved
leave of absence, respectively, would normally remain an employee in the
absence of this transaction, and Seller shall continue to provide such Inactive
Employees for the period that they remain employees of the Seller with such
benefits as Seller or an Affiliate of Seller was providing on the applicable
Hire Date to employees on long-term disability leave, short-term disability
leave or approved leave of absence, respectively. Seller shall remain and be
solely responsible for any severance or other liability of any nature
attributable to the cessation of employment of Business Employees with the
Seller, regardless of the date such cessation occurs; provided, however, that
Seller's retention of such responsibility and liability shall not preclude
Seller from seeking recourse against the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer for any
breach of Buyer's covenants in this Section 3.02, it being understood that
Seller shall retain all such responsibility and liability to the extent that
the business unit to which such Business Employee relates was not transferred
as contemplated hereunder. Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.02, as
of the applicable Hire Date, Buyer shall assume responsibility for all salary,
bonus, commission costs, benefits and other employment related costs accrued on
and after the applicable Hire Date with respect to each Transferred Employee.
Seller shall not take, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to take, any
action that would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with Buyer's
or an Affiliate of Buyer's effort to hire or retain any Business Employee.

               (b) Offers of Employment from Buyer. Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer has extended offers of employment to all Business Employees in accordance
with the provisions of Section 3.02(a).

                    (i) The terms of each offer specified that (except in the
     case of Inactive Employees) the offer was deemed accepted unless the
     Business Employee delivered a written rejection of the offer to Buyer no
     later than December 16, 2002. Buyer has provided Seller with a complete
     list of Business Employees who have rejected Buyer's offer of employment.
     The terms of the offers further specified that the effective date of
     employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer pursuant to the offer is
     contingent upon whether the Business Employee is an Inactive Employee on
     the applicable Hire Date. Business Employees who fail to timely reject an
     offer of employment from Buyer, and who are not Inactive Employees, shall
     become employees of Buyer on the applicable Hire Date.

                    (ii) The terms of each offer specified that each Business
     Employee who is an Inactive Employee on the applicable Hire Date shall be
     deemed to accept Buyer's offer and shall become an employee of Buyer or an
     Affiliate of Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date Seller
     notifies Buyer that such individual has notified Seller that he or she is
     ready and able to return to work, provided that (x) such notice to Buyer
     is given within six months of the otherwise applicable Hire Date and (y)
     on or prior to the time the Inactive Employee gives notice to the Seller
     that he or she is ready to return to work, he or she has not expressly
     rejected Buyer's offer. Inactive Employees who reject Buyer's offer shall
     be deemed to have resigned their employment with Seller.

               (c) Transferred Employees. Effective as of the applicable Hire
Date, except as expressly provided herein, Buyer shall cause each Business
Employee who accepts and commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer as of the applicable Hire Date (the "Transferred Employees") to be
provided with compensation and benefits that shall, in the aggregate, in
Buyer's reasonable judgment be substantially equivalent to the compensation and
benefits provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees; provided,
however, that for a period of one year following the applicable Hire Date, each
Transferred Employee shall be entitled to remain in substantially the same
position, with the same base salary and same vacation policy as maintained by
Seller as of the applicable Hire Date as set forth on Section 3.02(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (as updated by Seller after the date hereof),
provided that such employee remains employed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer;
and provided, further, to the extent that substantially all the business unit
to which a Business Employee relates was not transferred as contemplated in
Article II, Seller shall remain and be solely responsible for all severance and
other liability of any nature attributable to the cessation of employment of
such Business Employee with the Seller regardless of the date such cessation
occurs. Nothing herein shall be construed as guaranteeing employment for any
specific period of time or altering the at-will employment status of any
employee. For a transition period, if any, commencing on the applicable Hire
Date and ending on the sixtieth (60th) day following the closing date of the
transactions contemplated by the Brokerage Asset Purchase Agreement (subject to
possible extension (or earlier termination) in accordance with the provisions
of the Transition Services Agreement contemplated by the Brokerage Asset
Purchase Agreement) (the "Transition Period"), subject to limitations in and
requirements of Applicable Laws and applicable plans and contracts, Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Transferred Employees, (and Inactive Employees who commence employment with the
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer during the Transition Period) to continue to be
provided with the health and welfare benefits specified in the Transition
Services Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and Buyer shall pay
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in respect thereof as detailed in the
Transition Services Agreement. If Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, using
reasonable best efforts is unable to continue to provide such coverage, Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer shall make available to such employees health and
welfare plan coverage that is substantially equivalent to the coverage then
provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees, with no break in
coverage. Buyer shall not assume responsibility for the provision of benefits
to any Business Employee until such employee commences employment with Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer. Buyer shall not be precluded from modifying its
employment agreements, plans, policies and practices as to its employees
generally on or after the applicable Hire Date, provided that such changes
apply to all Buyer employees who are similarly situated to the Transferred
Employees, and further provided that (A) for a period of one year after the
applicable Hire Date Buyer shall continue to provide to each Transferred
Employee the same base salary and the same vacation policy as provided by
Seller as of immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date, provided that such
employee remains employed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; and (B) the
recognition of prior service, as described in Section 3.02(d), shall not be
eliminated. Buyer shall be solely liable in accordance with Section 3.02(g) for
the provision of COBRA benefits to any Transferred Employee who is terminated
by Buyer (or otherwise incurs a qualifying event) during the Transition Period.
Inactive Employees who commence employment with the Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall be treated as if such employees were Transferred Employees and
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 3.02, taking into
account their later commencement of employment date with the Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer.

               (d) Credit for Service. Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees
to participate in all Buyer plans in which participation is open to similarly
situated employees of Buyer at comparable levels for such similarly situated
employees, except where such participation in Buyer plans would result in a
duplication of benefits for such Transferred Employee, and Buyer shall cause
the Transferred Employees to be given full credit for all service with Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller prior to the applicable Hire Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits under any
employee benefit plans or arrangements of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or any
plans of Seller that are assumed by or maintained by Buyer in which such
Transferred Employees participate after the applicable Hire Date, to the same
extent such service was recognized by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date; provided, however, that such
service need not be recognized for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, nor shall
such service be recognized to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits. Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Transferred Employees
under any welfare plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the applicable Hire Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that
are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been
satisfied as of the applicable Hire Date under the corresponding welfare plan
of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in which such Transferred Employees
participate immediately prior to the applicable Hire Date, and (ii) for the
plan year in which the applicable Hire Date occurs, provide each Transferred
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
applicable Hire Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans in which such employees are eligible to
participate after the applicable Hire Date, as if those deductibles or
co-payments had been paid under the welfare plans in which such employees are
eligible to participate after the applicable Hire Date.

               (e) 401(k) Plan. Seller shall take such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that all Transferred Employees are, as of the applicable
Hire Date, 100% vested in their account balances under the Seller 401(k)
Savings Plan and the Oppenheimer Capital Accumulation 401(k) Plan (collectively
the "Seller 401(k) Plans"), and shall contribute to the Seller 401(k) Savings
Plan, within two weeks of the applicable Hire Date, such additional matching
contributions, if any, required for each Transferred Employee in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Seller 401(k) Savings Plan for the portion
of the Plan year in which the applicable Hire Date occurs during which such
Transferred Employees were employed by Seller. Commencing with the applicable
Hire Date, Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer's
401(k) plan, Buyer shall make any profit sharing contributions to such plan, on
the same terms and conditions as for comparable employees of Buyer, recognizing
their prior service to Seller and compensation from Seller, as service and
compensation with Buyer.

               (f) Certain Plans.

                    (i) Effective as of the applicable Hire Date, Buyer shall,
     or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, assume and maintain as plan
     sponsor and administrator and perform all obligations with respect to, the
     Seller's Executive Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred
     Compensation Plan"), as it applies to Transferred Employees. Between the
     date hereof and the applicable Hire Date, at Buyer's request, Seller shall
     provide a full and accurate report to Buyer as to the amounts accrued to
     date attributable to the Transferred Employees under the Deferred
     Compensation Plan. Seller shall transfer to Buyer, as of the close of
     business on the applicable Hire Date, securities attributable to each
     affected Transferred Employee's accounts under the Deferred Compensation
     Plan.

                    (ii) Subject to the limitations and requirements of
     Seller's Stock Participation Plan and various stock option plans
     maintained by Seller (the "Seller Equity Plans"), Seller shall recognize
     service with Buyer for the purposes of vesting and dividend distributions
     under the Seller Equity Plans after the applicable Hire Date as if it were
     service with Seller; provided, however, that Transferred Employees shall
     not be entitled to any new award under any Seller Equity Plan after the
     applicable Hire Date and provided, further, that nothing in this Section
     3.02(f)(ii) shall be construed to affect or in any way limit (A) the
     operation or application of any change in control provisions in any Seller
     Equity Plan; or (B) any right to a dividend distribution to which a
     Transferred Employee is otherwise entitled as a result of the transactions
     contemplated herein.

                    (iii) As of the applicable Hire Date, Buyer shall allow
     Transferred Employees to participate in its flexible spending account
     program. At Buyer's request, Seller shall take such action as may be
     necessary to transfer to Fahnestock, subject to applicable law and those
     requirements that must be complied with to maintain favorable tax
     treatment, the positive net aggregate balances (i.e., actual salary
     reductions, less expenses incurred), if any, under Seller's Flexible
     Spending Account Program for each of the Transferred Employees. Each
     salary reduction election executed by a Transferred Employee for 2003
     under Seller's Flexible Spending Account Program shall continue in effect
     for 2003 with respect to Buyer's flexible spending account program until
     such salary reduction election is revoked or amended by such Transferred
     Employee. Section 3.02(f)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists
     each Business Employee's flexible spending account salary reduction
     election made with respect to 2003.

               (g) COBRA. To the extent that any employee of Seller

of the Code maintained by Seller ("Group Health Plan") and such employee incurs
a qualifying event under Section 4980B of the Code on the applicable Hire Date
on account of his or her termination of employment with Seller, as determined
in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations, Seller shall comply with
all notice and continuation coverage requirements applicable to the Group
Health Plans under Section 4980B of the Code known as COBRA ("COBRA
Requirements") with respect to such employees and any "qualified beneficiaries"
(as defined in Section 4980B of the Code)) under the group health plan in
accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations thereunder,
provided that if for any reason Buyer has not established a health plan that
covers the Transferred Employees prior to the expiration of the Transition
Period, and any such Transferred Employee elects COBRA coverage under Seller's
health plans, Buyer shall pay the full COBRA premium on behalf of such
Transferred Employee (except for the amount such Transferred Employee would
have been required to pay as an active employee of Seller) and shall reimburse
Seller to the extent that any claims paid for Transferred Employees electing
COBRA exceed COBRA premiums and stop loss reimbursements. To the extent that a
Covered Employee participates in a Group Health Plan on or after the applicable
Hire Date, whether maintained by Seller during the Transition Period, or by
Buyer at any time, and such employee incurs a qualifying event under Section
4980B of the Code after the applicable Hire Date, Buyer shall assume
responsibility and shall comply with all COBRA Requirements with respect to
such employees and any "qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Section 4980B
of the Code) under the Group Health Plan in accordance with Section 4980B of
the Code and the regulations thereunder.

collectively as "WARN Obligations") as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for any WARN
Obligations arising as a result of any employment losses occurring on or prior
to any Hire Date except to the extent such losses are attributable to Buyer's
material failure to perform any of the covenants described herein.

following the applicable Hire Date of each Transferred Employee, including, (i)
payroll and fringe benefits, (ii) earned bonuses and incentive compensation,

claims incurred under health plans; provided, however, that Seller shall remain
liable and responsible for payments to Transferred Employees of any annual
incentive compensation bonuses for fiscal year 2002 as determined in accordance
with the applicable bonus plans maintained by Seller in which the Transferred
Employees participate as of the applicable Hire Date; and provided, further,
that with respect to any such bonuses earned for Seller's fiscal year 2003,
Seller shall transfer to Buyer a cash amount equivalent to the sum of 1/6ths of
the actual fiscal year 2002 bonus payment awarded to each Transferred Employee
and Inactive Employee (subject to a pro rata reduction for any period in which
any Inactive Employee was not entitled to a bonus payment during Seller's
fiscal year 2003), within ten (10) business days following confirmation of
acceptance of the employment offer made to each such individual from Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer; and provided, further, to the extent that substantially
all the business unit to which a Business Employee relates was not transferred
as contemplated in Article II, Seller shall remain and be solely responsible
for all severance and other liability of any nature attributable to the
cessation of employment of such Business Employee with the Seller regardless of
the date such cessation occurs. Subject to receiving the funds, if any, payable
by Seller under this paragraph, Buyer shall assume all liability for bonus
obligations payable to the Transferred Employees beginning November 1, 2002
through the applicable Hire Date, and Buyer shall pay each employee the 1/6ths
amount transferred by Seller in respect of such employee (less applicable
withholdings specific to this payment) on or prior to the time Buyer makes

               (j) Retained Liabilities. Seller shall retain and be solely
responsible for (i) all employment-related obligations and liabilities
(including all obligations and liabilities under the WARN Act and COBRA, if
any) relating to each employee, officer, director or consultant of the Asset
Management Business who is not a Business Employee and each Business Employee
(and his dependents or beneficiaries) with respect to whom Buyer has fulfilled
its obligations under this Section 3.02 to offer or transfer employment, but
who does not become a Transferred Employee (including any Business Employee who
declines employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or who does not return
to work from a disability or other leave of absence within six (6) months
following the applicable Hire Date) (a "Retained Employee") and (ii) all
compensation and benefit obligations and employment law claims of Transferred
Employees and other Business Employees who commence employment with the Buyer
or an Affiliate of the Buyer to the extent arising from events or conditions
that existed prior to the time as of which such employee commenced employment
with the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer ((i) and (ii) together, the "Retained
Employee Liabilities") (provided, however, that Seller's retention of such
responsibility and liability shall not preclude Seller from seeking recourse
against the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer for any breach of Buyer's covenants
in this Section 3.02). Buyer shall be solely liable for all compensation and
benefit obligations and employment law claims of Transferred Employees and

     developments and events relating to such Tax Claim (including promptly

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Seller Related Instruments to which it is

in effect relating to creditors' rights, and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject

restricting any Seller Entity's or any such Subsidiary's rights to use any
Intellectual Property, including license agreements, development agreements,
distribution agreements, settlement agreements, consent to use agreements, and

     to use, free and clear of all Liens, all of the Intellectual Property.

                    (ii) The Intellectual Property owned by the applicable
     Seller Entity and, to the best of Seller's knowledge, any Intellectual
     Property used by any Seller Entity, is subsisting, in full force and
     effect, and has not been cancelled, expired, or abandoned, and, to the
     best of Seller's knowledge is valid and enforceable.

                    (iii) There is no pending or, to the best of Seller's
     knowledge, threatened claim, suit, arbitration or other adversarial
     proceeding before any court, agency, arbitral tribunal, or registration
     authority in any jurisdiction involving the Intellectual Property owned by
     any Seller Entity, or, to the best of Seller's knowledge, the Intellectual
     Property licensed to any Seller Entity, alleging that the activities or
     the conduct of any Seller Entity's businesses infringe upon, violate or
     constitute the unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of any
     third party or challenging the ownership, use, validity, enforceability or
     registrability of any Intellectual Property by any Seller Entity. There
     are no settlements, forbearances to sue, consents, judgments, or orders or
     similar obligations other than the License Agreements which (1) restrict
     the right of any Seller Entity to use any Intellectual Property, (2)
     restrict the businesses of any Seller Entity in order to accommodate a
     third party's intellectual property rights or (3) permit third parties to

     currently conducted or planned to be conducted does not infringe upon
     (either directly or indirectly such as through contributory infringement
     or inducement to infringe) any intellectual property rights owned or
     controlled by any third party. To the best of Seller's knowledge, no third
     party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any
     Intellectual Property owned or used by any Seller Entity and no such
     claims, suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings have been
     brought or threatened against any third party by any Seller Entity.

                    (v) Seller Parent or the applicable Seller Entity has taken
     reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of Trade Secrets. To
     the best of Seller's knowledge, no Trade Secret has been disclosed or
     authorized to be disclosed to any third party other than pursuant to a
     non-disclosure agreement. To the best of Seller's knowledge, no party to
     any non-disclosure agreement relating to its Trade Secrets is in breach or
     default thereof.

                    (vi) No current or former partner, director, officer, or
     employee of any Seller Entity (or any of their respective predecessors in
     interest) shall, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
     herein, own or retain any rights to use any of the Intellectual Property
     owned or used by any Seller Entity or any Subsidiary of any of them.

               (d) The consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby
shall not result in the loss or impairment of the right of any Seller Entity

of any governmental authority or third party in respect of any such
Intellectual Property. No consents are required in order for Buyer to assume
the rights and obligations of the Seller Entities or the Subsidiaries of any of
them under each License Agreement.

               (e) To the knowledge of Seller, the Oppenheimer Name as used in
the Asset Management Business does not infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of any third party and
except as set forth in Section 4.09(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
Seller has not licensed the Oppenheimer Name to any other party for the use
provided for in, or in any manner in conflict with, the Name Assignment
Agreement.

Entity with respect to the Asset Management Business or any of the Asset
Management Assets or any Registered Representative or other employee of the
Asset Management Business by or before any Governmental Entity, or by or on
behalf of any third party. None of the Litigation set forth on such Schedule is
reasonably likely to (i) result in material liability to any Seller Entity,
materially interfere with or inhibit the operation of the Asset Management
Business or materially impair the value of the Asset Management Assets, (ii)
have the effect of delaying, preventing, or making illegal the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) materially interfering with the

         9.01  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Final Closing:

               (a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

               (b) at any time after June 30, 2003, by either Buyer or Seller,

this Agreement may be waived by the other parties at any time by an instrument

operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure to comply.

        FEES AND EXPENSES: SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION

         10.01  Fees and Expenses. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated
pursuant hereto, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, shall
pay all fees and expenses incurred by such person or on such person's behalf
in connection with or in anticipation of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         10.02 Survival of Representations. The representations and warranties

the conditions of this Article X, Seller Parent and Company agree, jointly and
severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer Parent, Buyer and
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and
Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer Indemnitees"), at any time and from time to
time after the Applicable Closing, from and against all demands, claims,
actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses, including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses (collectively, "Damages"), asserted against, resulting to, imposed
upon or incurred by Buyer Indemnitees, directly or indirectly, by reason of or
resulting from: (a) liabilities, obligations or claims of or against Seller
Parent, Company or any of their Affiliates or relating to the Asset Management
Business or the Asset Management Assets (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise) existing as of the Applicable First Closing Date or arising out
of facts, conditions or circumstances occurring prior to the Applicable

Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any facts or

Seller Claims until the Buyer Indemnitees have suffered Damages pursuant to
this Section 10.03 and Section 10.03 of the Brokerage Asset Purchase Agreement
in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate with all other Seller Claims
hereunder and thereunder at which point Seller Parent and Company shall be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for all Damages which exceed

Buyer or any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries, Seller may, in its

if any, on which survival of such representation or warranty terminates
pursuant to Section 10.02, whether or not any Damages have then actually been
sustained; and

               (b) when taken together with any damages sustained by reason of
any claim under Section 10.03(b) of the Brokerage Asset Purchase Agreement, of
not exceed the sum of (i) the Purchase Price and (ii) the original principal
amount of the Broker Loans.

               10.05 Buyer Parent's and Buyer's Agreement to Indemnify. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Article X, Buyer Parent and
Buyer agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller, and its directors, officers, employees, representatives and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") at any time and from time to time
after the Applicable Closing, from and against all Damages asserted against,
resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Seller Indemnitees, directly or

course of their duties for Buyer (other than actions related to the transfer
of any Clients (or accounts thereof) to Buyer or obtaining any Consents
thereof) (the items referred to in clauses (a) through (e) being collectively
referred to herein as the "Buyer Claims"); provided, however, that Buyer and
Buyer Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for
any Buyer Claims until the Seller Indemnitees have suffered Damages pursuant
to this Section 10.05 and Section 10.05 of the Brokerage Asset Purchase
Agreement in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate with all other Buyer Claims
hereunder and thereunder at which point Buyer and Buyer Parent shall be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for all Damages which exceed
$1,000,000. In satisfaction of any indemnity obligations to Company, Seller
Parent or any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries, Buyer Parent and Buyer
may, in their discretion, (A) pay any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
10.05 in cash, or (B) reduce the then outstanding principal amount of any
indebtedness or other payment obligation owed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates to Buyer Parent or Buyer, by such amount.

         10.06  Buyer Parent's and Buyer's Limitation of Liability.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of

10.05(b) against any Damages sustained by reason of any Buyer Claim thereunder
for a breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer Parent or Buyer:

               (a) shall be limited to Buyer Claims as to which any of Seller
Indemnitees has given Buyer Parent or Buyer written notice thereof on or prior
to the date, if any, on which survival of such representation or warranty
terminates pursuant to Section 10.02, whether or not any Damages have then
actually been sustained; and

               (b) when taken together with any damages sustained by reason of
any claim under Section 10.05(b) of the Brokerage Asset Purchase Agreement, of
not exceed the sum of (i) the Purchase Price and (ii) the original principal
amount of the Broker Loans.

         10.07  Conditions of Indemnification. The obligations and
liabilities of Seller Parent, Company, Buyer Parent and Buyer with respect to
Buyer Claims or Seller Claims (collectively, "Claims") made by third parties
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

               (a) The indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party
prompt notice of any such Claim, and the indemnifying party shall have the
right to undertake the defense thereof by representatives chosen by it;

               (b) If the indemnifying party, within a reasonable time after
notice of any such Claim, fails to defend the indemnified party against which
such Claim has been asserted, the indemnified party shall (upon further notice
to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
indemnifying party subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume
the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final
determination thereof; and

               (c) Anything in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) if there is a reasonable probability that a Claim may materially and
adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments, the indemnified party shall have the right, at its
own cost and expense, to defend, compromise or settle such Claim, and (ii) the
indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified
party, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any manner that admits wrongdoing or any violation of law or which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the
plaintiff to the indemnified party a release from all liability in respect to
such Claim.

         10.08  Cooperation. If requested by the indemnifying party, the
indemnified person shall cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel
in contesting any Claim which the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Claim
or any cross-complaint against any person and further agrees to take such
other action as reasonably may be requested by an indemnifying party to reduce
or eliminate any loss or expense for which the indemnifying party would have
responsibility, but the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified
person for any expenses incurred by it in so cooperating or acting at the
request of the indemnifying party.

         10.09  Other Indemnification Provisions.

               (a) The amount of Damages incurred by any indemnified party
shall be reduced by and to the extent that such indemnified party shall have
received proceeds under insurance policies, risk sharing pools, or similar
arrangements specifically as a result of, and in compensation for, the subject
matter of the Claim in respect of such Damages, net of any increased premiums
resulting from or similar costs arising out of the making of such claims
against such insurance or other arrangements.

               (b) The determination of the amount of Damages sustained by any
indemnified party in respect of any Claim shall not be reduced by Tax
benefits, if any, resulting from or relating to such Claim.

                                  ARTICLE XI
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

assigns, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or

         11.10  Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

               (a) This Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced
in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

               (b) Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, and (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to
commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto either in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such suit,
action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for reasons of
subject matter jurisdiction, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (A) the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (B) the United Sates
District Court for the Southern District of New York, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         11.11  Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives its
respective rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based upon
or arising out of this agreement or any dealings between them relating to the
subject matter of this agreement and the relationship that is being
established. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of
any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the
subject matter of this agreement, including, without limitation, contract
claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common law and
statutory claims. The parties acknowledge that this waiver is a material
inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each party has already
relied on the waiver in entering into this agreement and that each party will
continue to rely on the waiver in their related future dealings. Each party
further warrants and represents it has reviewed this waiver with its legal
counsel, and that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights
following consultation with legal counsel. This waiver is irrevocable, meaning
that it may not be modified either orally or in writing, and the waiver shall
apply to any subsequent amendments, renewals, supplements or modifications to
this agreement or to any other documents or agreements relating to the
transaction contemplated hereby. In the event of litigation, this agreement
may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.

         11.12  Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not
be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of
adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel
specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted hereunder.
