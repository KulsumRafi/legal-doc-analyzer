obligation to inquire into the propriety of any such instructions.

               (e)    NOTIFICATION OF LENDERS. Upon receipt of a Request for

Lender shall, not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date specified in
such notice, make available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Office, or at such account as the

                                       33
<Page>

Administrative Agent shall designate, the amount of its portion of the
applicable Advance in immediately available funds.

               (f)    DISBURSEMENT. Prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the
date of an Advance hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.2 and in Article 4
hereof, disburse the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the
Lenders in immediately available funds by (i) transferring the amounts so made
available by wire transfer pursuant to the instructions of the Borrower, or (ii)
in the absence of such instructions, crediting the amounts so made available to
the account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent or an
Affiliate of the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from a Lender prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the
date of any Advance that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Advance, and so long
as notice has been given as provided in Section 2.2(e) hereof, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Advance and the Administrative
Agent may, in its sole discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate equal to
the daily average Federal Funds Rate for such period. If such Lender shall repay
to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid
shall constitute such Lender's portion of the applicable Advance for purposes of
this Agreement. If such Lender does not repay such corresponding amount
immediately upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such
corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent, together with all interest
accrued thereon at the interest rate that would have applied to such Advance had
such Lender funded its portion thereof. The failure of any Lender to fund its
portion of any Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to fund its respective portion of the Advance on the date of such
borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for any such failure of any other
Lender. In the event that, at any time when the Borrower is not in Default and
has otherwise satisfied all of the conditions to funding set forth in this
Agreement, a Lender for any reason fails or refused to fund its portion of an
Advance, then, until such time as such Lender has funded its portion of such
Advance, or all other Lenders have received payment in full (whether by
repayment or prepayment) of the principal and interest due in respect to such
advance, such non-funding Lender shall (i) have no right to vote regarding any
issue on which voting is required or advisable under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document and the calculation of Majority Lenders and Super-Majority Lenders
with respect solely to such votes shall be adjusted as if such non-funding
Lender has no Commitments and no Loans outstanding, and (ii) be entitled to
receive no

                                       34
<Page>

payments of principal, interest or fees from the Borrower in respect of such
Loans which such Lender failed to make. Nothing in this subsection shall be
deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as
a result of any failure by such Lender to fund its portion of any Advance.

          Section 2.3 INTEREST.

               (a)    ON BASE RATE ADVANCES. Interest on each Base Rate Advance
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days when the Base Rate is
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and on the basis of a year of 360 days
when the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Rate, in each
case for the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable in arrears on

with respect to Base Rate Advances pursuant to Section 2.3(f) hereof.

               (b)    ON EURODOLLAR ADVANCES. Interest on each Eurodollar
Advance shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number
of days elapsed and shall be payable in arrears (i) on the applicable Payment
Date for such Eurodollar Advance, and (ii) if the Eurodollar Advance Period for
such Eurodollar Advance exceeds three (3) months, on each three (3) month
anniversary of the making of such Eurodollar Advance. Interest on Eurodollar
Advances then outstanding shall also be due and payable on the date of any
repayment made under Sections 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 hereof and on the applicable
Maturity Date. Interest shall accrue and be payable on each Eurodollar Advance

prepay the Revolving Loans, with a corresponding permanent reduction in the
Revolving Loan Commitment, in the manner set forth above.

such Advance, (ii) the date of the next Advance of the Revolving Loans, or (iii)
the Initial Maturity Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Borrower may prepay any Swing
Loan Advance prior to the date it is due upon notice to the Swing Loan Lender
not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of prepayment of such
Advance. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such
date on the amount prepaid. If, and to the extent, any Swing Loans shall be
outstanding on the date of any Advance of the Revolving Loans, such Swing Loans
shall be repaid from the proceeds of such Advance of the Revolving Loans prior
to any distribution of such proceeds to the Borrower. If, and to the extent, an
Advance of the Revolving Loans is not requested prior to earlier of (A) the
Initial Maturity Date or (B) the last day of any such seven (7) day period from
the date of any Advance of the Swing Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Base Rate Loan on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial
Maturity Date or the last day of such seven (7) day period, as applicable, in
the amount of the Swing Loans then outstanding, the proceeds of which shall be
used to repay the Swing Loan Lender for such Swing Loans. In addition, the Swing
Loan Lender may, at any time, in its sole discretion by written notice to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, require repayment of its Swing Loans by
way of a Revolving Loan, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Base Rate Advance of the Revolving Loans in the amount of such Swing
Loans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such demand shall be deemed to have been
given one (1) Business Day prior to the Initial Maturity Date and upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default

                                       43
<Page>

described in Section 9.1(j) or 9.1(k) hereof and also upon acceleration of the
Obligations, whether on account of an Event of Default described in Section
9.1(j) or 9.1(k) hereof or any other Event of Default, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.2 hereof following an Event of Default (each such
Revolving Loan made on account of any such deemed request therefor as provided
herein being hereinafter referred to as a "MANDATORY BORROWING"). Each Lender
hereby irrevocably agrees to make its Revolving Commitment Percentage of such
Revolving Loans promptly upon any such request or deemed request on account of
each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the
preceding sentence and on the same such date, notwithstanding (I) the amount of
Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of
Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions
specified in Article 4 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event
of Default then exists, (IV) failure for any such request or deemed request for
Revolving Loans to be made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.2, (V)
the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (VI) any reduction in the Revolving
Loan Commitment or termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment relating thereto
immediately prior to such Mandatory Borrowing or contemporaneously therewith;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be required to make such Revolving Loans
if, at the time that the Swing Loan Lender agreed to fund any Swing Loan
Request, the Swing Loan Lender had knowledge of the existence of an Event of
Default or such Mandatory Borrowing would cause a Lender to exceed its Revolving
Loan Commitment. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason
be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as
a result of the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the
Borrower or any other obligor hereunder), then each Lender hereby agrees that it
shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or
after such date and prior to such purchase) from the Swing Loan Lender such
participations in the outstanding Swing Loans as shall be necessary to cause
each such Lender to share in such Swing Loans ratably based upon its respective
Revolving Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to Section 9.2), provided
that (A) all interest payable on the Swing Loans shall be for the account of the
Swing Loan Lender until the date as of which the respective participation is
purchased, and (B) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this
sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay (to
the extent not paid by the Borrower) to the Swing Loan Lender interest on the
principal amount of participation purchased for each day from and including the
day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred but
excluding the date of payment for such participation, at the rate equal to, if
paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Mandatory Borrowing, the
Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.

               (c)    INTEREST ON SWING LOANS. Swing Loans shall bear interest
at the simple per annum interest rate equal to the sum of (x) the Base Rate and
(y) the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Base Rate Advances of
the Revolving Loans, computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days when the
Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and on the basis of a
year of 360 days when

                                       44
<Page>

the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Rate, in each case
for the actual number of days elapsed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) from and
after any failure to make any payment of principal or interest in respect of any
of the Loans hereunder when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace
period), whether at scheduled or accelerated maturity or on account of any
mandatory prepayment or (ii) while any Swing Loans in which the Lenders have
acquired participations pursuant to Section 2.8(b) hereof remain outstanding,
the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on, Swing Loans
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Default Rate. Interest on each
Swing Loan shall be payable in arrears on the date payment of such Swing Loan is
due pursuant to Section 2.8(b) hereof.

               (d)    REPORTING. Unless the Swing Loan Lender is the
Administrative Agent, the Swing Loan Lender shall provide to the Administrative
Agent, on Friday of each week and on each date the Administrative Agent notifies
the Swing Loan Lender that the Borrower has made a Request for Advance or the
Administrative Agent otherwise requests the same, an accounting for the
outstanding Swing Loans in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

               (e)    TERMINATION OF SWING LOANS; DESIGNATION OF SWING LOAN
LENDER. Unless a Default or an Event of Default then exists, the Swing Loan
Lender shall give the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at least seven (7)
days prior written notice before exercising its discretion herein not to make
Swing Loans. The Borrower must give ten (10) days prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent of any change in designation of the Swing Loan Lender. The
replaced Swing Loan Lender shall continue to be a "Swing Loan Lender" for
purposes of repayment of any Swing Loans made prior to such replacement and
outstanding after such replacement.

          Section 2.9 NOTES; LOAN ACCOUNTS.

               (a)    The Loans shall be repayable in accordance with the terms
and provisions set forth herein. Upon the request of any Lender, (i) a Revolving
Note shall be issued by the Borrower to the order of such Lender in accordance
with such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage, and (ii) a Term B Note shall
be issued by the Borrower to the order of such Lender in accordance with such
Lender's Term B Commitment Percentage. The Swing Loans shall be evidenced by the
Swing Loan Note, which Swing Loan Note shall be issued by the Borrower and
payable to the order of the Swing Loan Lender in the amount of the Swing Loan
Committed Amount. If applicable, an Incremental Facility Loan Note shall be
issued by the Borrower to the order of such Incremental Facility Lender in
accordance with its pro rata share of the Incremental Facility Commitments. Any
Notes issued by the Borrower shall be duly executed and delivered by one or more
Authorized Signatories of the Borrower

               (b)    Each Lender may open and maintain on its books in the name
of the Borrower a loan account with respect to the Loans and interest thereon.
Each Lender which opens such loan account or accounts shall debit the applicable
loan

                                       45
<Page>

account for the principal amount of each Advance made by it and accrued interest
thereon, and shall credit such loan account for each payment on account of
principal of or interest on the Loans. The records of each Lender with respect
to the loan accounts maintained by it shall be prima facie evidence of the Loans
and accrued interest thereon, but the failure to maintain such records shall not
impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Indebtedness hereunder.

               (c)    Each Advance of the Revolving Loans from the Lenders
(other than the Swing Loan Lender) under this Agreement shall be made pro rata
by the Lenders on the basis of their respective Revolving Commitment
Percentages.

          Section 2.10 MANNER OF PAYMENT.

               (a)    Each payment (including any prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of the principal of or interest on the Loans, commitment fees, and any
other amount owed to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made not later than 2:00 p.m.
(New York time) on the date specified for payment under this Agreement or such
other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent to an account designated by the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, in lawful money of the United States of America in
immediately available funds. Any payment received by the Administrative Agent
after 2:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed received on the next Business
Day for purposes of interest and fee accrual. In the case of a payment for the
account of a Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter
distribute the amount so received in like funds to such Lender. If the
Administrative Agent shall not have received any payment from the Borrower as
and when due, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders
accordingly.

               (b)    If any payment under this Agreement or otherwise in
respect of the Loans shall be specified to be made upon a day which is not a
Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business
Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing
interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.

               (c)    Except as otherwise provided below, any and all payments
by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party under this
Agreement or otherwise in respect of the Loans shall be made without set-off or
counterclaim or deduction whatsoever.

                      (i)       Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, any
and all payments by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the other
Credit Parties, or any of them, under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of
the Loans shall be made without any deduction or withholding for present or
future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties,
withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing
authority, excluding, however, franchise,

                                       46
<Page>

withholding, branch or other similar Taxes, duties, fees or charges imposed on
or measured by any Credit Party's net income or receipts (such non-excluded
items being called "TAXES").

                      (ii)      If the Borrower shall be required by Applicable
Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any amounts payable hereunder or
otherwise in respect of the Loans to the Administrative Agent or any other
Credit Party, (A) except as otherwise provided in this Section, the sum payable
shall be increased ("ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS") as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.10(c)), the Administrative Agent or such other Credit
Party, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no deductions been made, (B) the Borrower shall make such
deductions, and (C) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with Applicable
Law. Moreover, if any Taxes (which for purposes of this sentence shall include
taxes and charges imposed on or measured by net income or receipts of any Credit
Party by any jurisdiction to the extent imposed on Additional Amounts) are
directly asserted against any Credit Party with respect to any payment received
by such Credit Party hereunder, such Credit Party may pay such Taxes, and,
except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Borrower will promptly pay
such additional amount (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is
necessary in order that the net amount received and retained by such Credit
Party after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional
amount) shall equal the amount such Credit Party would have received and
retained had no such Taxes been asserted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, such Credit Party
shall give written notice to the Borrower, accompanied by, to the extent
provided by the relevant taxing authority, a calculation in reasonable detail of
the amount demanded and evidence of the Taxes imposed on such Credit Party,
after such Credit Party has actual knowledge of the imposition of any Taxes.
Where notice is not given to the Borrower within forty-five (45) days after the
Credit Party receives written notice of the assertion of Taxes and the Borrower
does not otherwise have notice of such assertion, the Borrower shall not be
required to pay penalties, additions to taxes, expenses, and interest accruing
on such Taxes from the date forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Credit
Party of written notice of the assertion of such Taxes until the date that the
Borrower receives such notice. The Borrower shall furnish to such Credit Party
within forty-five (45) days (or as soon thereafter as available) after the date
the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to Applicable Law true and correct
copies of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Borrower. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section, if the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes that it is
required to pay pursuant to the terms of this Agreement when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to any of the Credit Parties the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Credit Parties for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties
that may become payable by the Credit Parties primarily as a result of any such
failure.

                      (iii)     Each Lender that is not a United States person
within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code (a "FOREIGN LENDER") shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, no later than the date
hereof (or if such Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (whether by
assignment or otherwise) after the date hereof, the date upon which such Foreign
Lender becomes a party hereto), (A) two (2) complete, duly executed original IRS
Forms W-8ECI or IRS Forms W-8BEN, or any successors thereto, establishing that
such Foreign Lender is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive any
and all payments from the Borrower under this Agreement or otherwise in respect
of the Loans free from withholding of United States federal income tax or (B) in
the case of such Foreign Lender that is not legally entitled to deliver either
form listed in clause (b)(iii)(A), (I) a certificate of a duly authorized
officer of such Foreign Lender to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (x)
a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (y) a "10
percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B)
of the Code or (z) a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a
related person within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (such
certificate, an "EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE") and (II) two (2) duly completed copies
of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or successor applicable form, certifying
that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States federal
withholding tax on payments of interest. Each Foreign Lender shall, from time to
time, deliver updated or corrected IRS Forms W-8ECI, IRS Forms W-8BEN or
Exemption Certificates, or any successors thereto, to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to the extent and in the manner required under United
States federal tax law. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any Additional
Amounts under Section 2.10(c)(ii) hereof to a Foreign Lender if such Foreign
Lender (I) fails to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.10(c)(iii)
hereof or, (II) fails to qualify for a complete reduction or exemption of United
States federal tax withholding for any reason other than a change in the United
States federal tax law, or the official interpretation thereof, in each case,
after the delivery of IRS Forms W-8ECI, IRS Forms W-8BEN or an Exemption
Certificate, or any successors thereto, or (III) is treated as a "conduit
entity" within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.881-3 or any
successor provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the date of an
assignment pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement,
the assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.10(c)(ii) hereof, then, to
such extent, the assignee, shall not be required to deliver IRS Forms W-8ECI,
IRS Forms W-8BEN or an Exemption Certificate, or any successors thereto,
establishing a withholding rate for such Foreign Lender that is less than the
rate the assignor was subject to, and the assignee shall be entitled to receive
Additional Amounts to such extent the assignor was so entitled.

                      (iv)      Each of the Credit Parties agrees that it will,
to the extent reasonable and without material cost or risk to it, (A) take all
actions reasonably requested by the Borrower to maintain all exemptions, if any,
available to it from United States federal withholding taxes (whether available
by treaty, statute, or existing administrative waiver) and (B) otherwise
cooperate with the Borrower to minimize any

                                       48
<Page>

amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.10(c), including the
contest of any asserted tax liability.

                      (v)       Any Credit Party that becomes aware that it is
entitled to receive a refund (whether by way of a direct payment or by offset)
in respect of Additional Amounts paid by the Borrower, which refund, would
reasonably be considered allocable to or resulting from such payment or
indemnification made pursuant to this Section 2.10, shall promptly notify the
Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of a request from the Borrower, apply for such refund with the
Borrower being responsible for any incremental costs associated with such refund
request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) the Borrower shall not be entitled to any
damages as a result of the failure of such Credit Party to so notify the
Borrower of the availability of such refund and (B) the Borrower shall not have
the right to examine the books or records of any Credit Party. If any Credit
Party receives any such refund (as described in the preceding sentence), it
shall promptly repay the amount of such refund (together with any interest
received thereon) to the Borrower; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower, upon
the request of the applicable Credit Party, shall repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower in the event such Credit Party is required to repay such refund to
the applicable authority.

                      (vi)      If the Borrower is or becomes required to pay
any Additional Amounts to a Credit Party pursuant to this Section 2.10, the
Borrower shall have the right, upon notice to the Administrative Agent and such
Credit Party to (A) prepay without penalty, on a non-pro rata basis, all or any
portion of a Loan held by such Credit Party plus all interest and Additional
Amounts owing to such Credit Party as of the date of such prepayment, (B)
require such Credit Party to use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loan under this Agreement or to assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another of its offices,
branches or affiliates, or (C) require such Credit Party to effect an assignment
of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to another Credit
Party designated by the Borrower if, in the case of clause (B) or (C) such
designation or assignment (x) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 2.10 in the future and (y) would not cause the imposition on
such Credit Party of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed
by such Credit Party to be material or otherwise disadvantageous to such Credit
Party.

          Section 2.11 REIMBURSEMENT. Whenever any Lender shall actually incur
any losses or out-of-pocket expenses in connection with (a) the failure by the
Borrower to convert, continue or borrow any Eurodollar Advance after having
given notice of its intention to convert, continue or borrow such Eurodollar
Advance in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof (whether by reason of the election
of the Borrower not to proceed or the non-fulfillment of any of the conditions
set forth in Article 4 hereof) other than a failure to borrow resulting from an
unavailability which occurs after notice from the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 hereof, (b) the

                                       49
<Page>

prepayment of any Eurodollar Advance in whole or in part (including a prepayment
pursuant to Sections 11.2 and 11.3(b) hereof), or (c) the failure by the
Borrower to prepay any Advance after notice of prepayment has been given by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof, the
Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon the earlier of such Lender's demand
or the applicable Maturity Date, an amount sufficient to compensate such Lender
for all such losses and out-of-pocket expenses. Such Lender's good faith
determination of the amount of such losses and out-of-pocket expenses, absent
manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive. Upon request of the Borrower,
any Lender seeking reimbursement under this Section 2.11 shall provide a
certificate setting forth the amount to be paid to it by the Borrower hereunder
and calculations therefor.

          Section 2.12 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.

               (a)    Prior to the Final Maturity Date or the acceleration of
the Loans under Section 9.2 hereof, and other than with respect to payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof (which shall be applied as
set forth in Section 2.6), if some but less than all amounts due from the
Borrower are received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will
distribute such amounts as follows: FIRST, pro rata among the Credit Parties
based on the total amount of such fees, costs and expenses, to the payment of
any fees, costs and expenses then due and payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document; SECOND, pro rata among the Lenders based on the principal amount
of the Loans outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to any unpaid
interest then due and payable on the Loans; THIRD, pro rata among the Lenders
based on the principal amount of the Term B Loans outstanding immediately prior
to such payment, to the payment of principal then due and payable on the Term B
Loans; FOURTH, pro rata among the Lenders based on their respective Revolving
Commitment Percentages outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to the
payment of principal then due and payable on the Revolving Loans; and FIFTH, pro
rata among the Credit Parties based on the amount of such Obligations
outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to the payment of any other
Obligations not otherwise referred to in this Section 2.12(a) then due and
payable.

               (b)    Subsequent to the Final Maturity Date or the acceleration
of the Loans under Section 9.2 hereof, payments made to any Credit Party, or
otherwise received by any Credit Party (from realization on Collateral or
otherwise), shall be distributed as follows: FIRST, to the costs and expenses,
if any, incurred by the Credit Parties, or any of them, to the extent permitted
by Section 12.2 hereof, in the collection of such amounts under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any
reasonable costs incurred in connection with the sale or disposition of any
Collateral for the Obligations; SECOND, pro rata among the Credit Parties based
on the total amount of fees then due and payable, to any fees then due and
payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document and to any other fees then
due and payable to the Lenders under this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
THIRD, pro

                                       50
<Page>

rata among the Lenders based on the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to any unpaid interest which may
have accrued on the Loans; FOURTH, pro rata among the Lenders based on the
principal amount of the Loans outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to
any unpaid principal of the loans; FIFTH, to any other Obligations not otherwise
referred to in this Section 2.12(b) until all such Obligations are paid in full;
SIXTH, pro rata among the Credit Parties based on the amount of damages
outstanding immediately prior to such payment, to damages incurred by the Credit
Parties, or any of them, by reason of any breach of this Agreement or of any
other Loan Documents; and SEVENTH, upon satisfaction in full of all Obligations,
to the Borrower or as otherwise required by law.

               (c)    If any Lender shall obtain any payment on any date
(whether involuntary or otherwise) on account of the Loans (excluding any Swing
Loans) made by it in excess of its ratable share of the payments made by the
Borrower to the Credit Parties on such date (in the aggregate), such that, after
giving effect thereto, such Lender's outstanding Loans (excluding any Swing
Loans) are less than such Lender's ratable share of all the Loans then
outstanding (in the aggregate) in accordance with such Lender's Commitment
Percentage, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Loans made by such other Lenders as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to each purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery. The Borrower agrees that any
Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.12(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation so
long as the Obligations are not increased as a result of such participation. If
the Swing Loan Lender shall receive any payment on any date on account of its
Swing Loans in excess the amount to which it is entitled in accordance with
Section 2.8(a), the Swing Loan Lender shall remit the amount of such excess to
the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent may direct in accordance with
Section 2.8(a).

          Section 2.13 CAPITAL ADEQUACY. In the event that any Lender shall have
determined that a Regulatory Change has the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then from time to time, ten (10) days after submission by such Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request
therefor, together with a certificate (which shall be conclusive absent manifest
error), setting forth the calculations evidencing such requested additional
amount, and the law or regulation with respect thereto and certifying that such
request is consistent with such Lender's treatment of other similar customers
having similar

                                       51
<Page>

provisions generally in their agreements with such Lender and that such request
is being made on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the costs resulting
from such law or regulation, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
Allocations shall not be deemed reasonable unless made ratably, to the extent
practicable, to all affected assets, commitments, activities or other relevant
aspects of such Lender's business, whether or not the Lender is entitled to
compensation with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower
shall only be obligated to compensate such Lender for any amount under this
subsection arising or occurring during (a) in the case of each such request for
compensation, any time or period commencing not more than ninety (90) days prior
to the date on which such Lender submits such request and (b) any other time or
period during which, because of the unannounced retroactive application of such
law, regulation, interpretation, request or directive, such Lender reasonably
could not have known that the resulting reduction in return might arise. Each
Lender will notify the Borrower that it is entitled to compensation pursuant to
this subsection as promptly as practicable after it determines to request such
compensation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to provide such notice shall
not restrict the ability of such Lender to be reimbursed under this
Section 2.13.

          Section 2.14 INCREMENTAL FACILITY LOANS.

               (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Borrower may request Incremental Facility Commitments on any Business Day;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower may not request Incremental Facility
Commitments or an Incremental Facility Loan during the continuance of a Default
or Event of Default, including, without limitation, any Default or Event of
Default that would result after giving effect to any Incremental Facility Loan;
and PROVIDED FURTHER, that the Borrower may request up to two (2) Incremental
Facility Commitments (each of which commitments may be from more than one
Lender) which may be no less than $60,000,000 and no more than $120,000,000 in
the aggregate. The Incremental Facility Maturity Date applicable to any of the
Incremental Facility Loans shall be no earlier than the Final Maturity Date. In
requesting Incremental Facility Commitments, the Borrower shall offer each of
the Lenders an opportunity to provide an Incremental Facility Commitment;
PROVIDED that none of the Lenders shall be required to issue an Incremental
Facility Commitment and the decision of any Lender to issue or not issue an
Incremental Facility Commitment to the Borrower shall be at such Lender's sole
discretion after being offered such right of first refusal (and the failure to
respond to any such offer by the requested deadline shall be deemed a refusal).
Persons not then Lenders may be included as Lenders having Incremental Facility
Commitments with the written approval of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent. The Incremental Facility Commitments (i) may be in the form of a
revolving or a term credit facility and may be structured as an institutional
tranche, (ii) must not (A) have scheduled amortization providing for principal
repayments or commitment reductions earlier than, or in an amount on a
percentage basis larger than, those dates or amounts set forth in the
amortization schedule

                                       52
<Page>

for the Term B Loans set forth herein, or (B) be secured by more or different
collateral than the Loans hereunder, and (iii) must be governed by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and be subject to terms and conditions
not more restrictive than those set forth herein and therein for the Loans.

               (b)    Prior to the effectiveness of any Incremental Facility
Commitment, the Borrower shall (i) deliver to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders a notice (each a "NOTICE OF INCREMENTAL FACILITY COMMITMENT"), in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth terms and
provisions with respect to interest rates and scheduled amortization with
respect to the proposed Incremental Facility Loan and (ii) provide revised
projections to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, which shall be in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and which
shall demonstrate the Borrower's ability to timely repay such Incremental
Facility Commitment and any Incremental Facility Loans thereunder and to comply
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

               (c)    No Incremental Facility Commitment shall by itself result
in any reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitment or the Term B Loan Commitment
or of the Commitment Percentages with respect thereto of such Lender issuing
such Incremental Facility Commitment.

               (d)    Advances of the Incremental Facility Loans (i) shall bear
interest at the Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate or such other reasonable rate
agreed to by the Lenders making such Incremental Facility Loans; (ii) subject to
Section 2.14(a) hereof, shall be repaid as agreed to by the Borrower and the
Lenders making such Incremental Facility Loans; (iii) shall for all purposes be
Obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents; (iv) shall be represented by
promissory notes which set forth terms and provisions with respect to interest
rates and scheduled amortization with respect to such Incremental Facility Loans
and are in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower (each, an "INCREMENTAL FACILITY NOTE"), and (v) shall rank pari passu
with the Loans for purposes of Sections 2.12 and 9.2 hereof (unless the
applicable Incremental Facility Lender shall otherwise agree in writing to have
its Incremental Facility Loans be junior to the Loans).

               (e)    Incremental Facility Loans shall be requested by the
Borrower pursuant to a request (which shall be substantially in the form of a
Request for Advance) delivered in the same manner as a Request for Advance, but
shall be funded pro rata only by those Lenders that hold the Incremental
Facility Commitments.

               (f)    In the event that the interest rate applicable to any of
the Incremental Facility Loans (including, without limitation, any original
issue discount in respect of such Incremental Facility Loans) shall exceed the
interest rate applicable to the Term B Loans by more than twenty-five (25) basis
points, the Applicable Margin for the Term B Loans shall automatically be
increased such that the interest rate applicable to the

                                       53
<Page>

Term B Loans is twenty-five (25) basis points less than the interest rate
applicable to such Incremental Facility Loans without any action or consent of
the Borrower, any Arranger or any Lender.

          Section 2.15 LETTERS OF CREDIT

               (a)    Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of at least three
(3) Business Days written notice from the Borrower in the form of a Request for
Issuance of Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly forward
such notice to the Arrangers, the Issuing Bank or, if requested by the Borrower,
to another Lender agreeing to act as an Issuing Bank (and if such Lender shall
accept and countersign such Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit, such
Lender shall become the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit), and
the applicable Issuing Bank will issue a Letter of Credit in the amount
requested subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and further
subject to the following: (i) after giving effect to the requested issuance, the
aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder would not
exceed the Letter of Credit Committed Amount, and (ii) after giving effect to
the requested issuance, the aggregate amount of all L/C Obligations then
outstanding, plus the aggregate amount of Swing Loans then outstanding, plus the
aggregate amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding shall not exceed the
Revolving Loan Commitment. No Letter of Credit shall have a maturity extending
beyond the earlier of (x) a term of one (1) year from the date of issuance or
(y) the Initial Maturity Date. Subject to the maturity limitations provided
herein and so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists or would be
caused thereby, Letters of Credit shall be renewable annually upon the request
of the Borrower and with the consent of the applicable Issuing Bank, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld but shall be subject to compliance
with customary letter of credit practices at the times of any proposed renewal.
Each Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit from the Borrower shall specify in
reasonable detail the documents which must be presented to draw under such
Letter of Credit, which specification shall include all documents which the
applicable Issuing Bank may reasonably require.

               (b)    If a Letter of Credit provides that it is automatically
renewable unless notice is given by the Issuing Bank with respect thereto that
it will not be renewed, such Issuing Bank and the Borrower shall give notice of
nonrenewal to the Administrative Agent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the last date on which a notice of non-renewal may be given to the beneficiary
of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Lenders and, unless so directed by the Majority Lenders at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the last date on which a notice of non-renewal may be
given to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank with respect
to such Letter of Credit shall not be bound to give notice of non-renewal to the
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit.

               (c)    Provided that no Default or Event of Default then exists
or would be caused thereby, each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Issuing Bank
to issue,

                                       54
<Page>

reconfirm, reissue and extend each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Issuing Bank hereby sells,
and each other Lender that has issued a Revolving Loan Commitment hereby
purchases, on a continuing basis, a participation and an undivided interest in
(A) the obligations of such Issuing Bank to honor any draws under the Letters of
Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) the Indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Issuing Bank under this Agreement in respect of Letters of
Credit issued by it, such participation being in the amount of such Lender's pro
rata share of such obligations and Indebtedness based on such Lender's Revolving
Commitment Percentage, in each case without further action by any party.

               (d)    Upon receipt of a draw certificate from the beneficiary of
a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent, which shall in turn notify the Borrower, the Arrangers and
each Lender that has issued a Revolving Loan Commitment, by telephone or
telecopy, of the amount of the requested draw and, in the case of each such
Lender, such Lender's portion of such draw amount as calculated in accordance
with its Revolving Commitment Percentage.

               (e)    The Borrower hereby irrevocably requests, and the Lenders
that have issued Revolving Loan Commitments hereby severally agree to make, a
Base Rate Advance to the Borrower (notwithstanding the minimum amount
requirements otherwise applicable to Base Rate Advances) on each day on which a
draw is made under any Letter of Credit and in the amount of such draw, and each
such Lender shall fund such Lender's share of such Base Rate Advance by payment
to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof and its
Revolving Commitment Percentage, without reduction for any set-off counterclaim
of any nature whatsoever. The obligation of each such Lender to make payments to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank, in accordance
with this Section 2.15 shall be absolute and unconditional, and no such Lender
shall be relieved of its obligations to make such payments by reason of
non-compliance by any other Person with the terms of any Letter of Credit or for
any other reason other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly remit to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received from
the applicable Lenders.

               (f)    The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it,
except for such actions or omissions as shall constitute gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank or such Issuing Bank's
willful failure to pay under any such Letter of Credit after presentation to it
of documents complying with the terms of such Letter of Credit, shall be binding
on the Borrower as between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank, and shall not
result in any liability of the Issuing Bank to the Borrower. The obligation of
the Borrower to reimburse the Lenders for Advances made to reimburse any Issuing
Bank for draws under the Letters of Credit issued by it shall be

                                       55
<Page>

absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances whatsoever,
including, without limitation, the following circumstances:

                      (i)       Any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Loan Document;

                      (ii)      Any amendment or waiver of or consent to any
departure from any or all of the Loan Documents;

                      (iii)     Any improper use which may be made of any Letter
of Credit or any improper acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of
any Letter of Credit in connection therewith;

                      (iv)      The existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
any right which the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or Persons for whom any such beneficiary or
any such transferee may be acting) or any Lender (other than the defense of
payment to such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or any
other Person, whether in connection with any Letter of Credit, any transaction
contemplated by any Letter of Credit, this Agreement, any other Loan Document,
or any unrelated transaction;

                      (v)       Any statement or any other documents presented
under any Letter of Credit proving to be insufficient, forged, fraudulent or
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in
any respect whatsoever, provided that such payment shall not have constituted
gross negligence of willful misconduct of the applicable Issuing Bank;

                      (vi)      The insolvency of any Person issuing any
documents in connection with any Letter of Credit;

                      (vii)     Any breach of any agreement between the Borrower
and any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit;

                      (viii)    Any irregularity in the transaction with respect
to which any Letter of Credit is issued, including any fraud by the beneficiary
or any transferee of such Letter of Credit;

                      (ix)      Any errors, omissions, interruptions or delays
in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, wireless
or otherwise, whether or not they are in code;

                      (x)       Any act, error, neglect or default, omission,
insolvency or failure of business of any of the correspondents of the applicable
Issuing

                                       56
<Page>

Bank, provided that the same shall not have constituted the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank;

                      (xi)      Any other circumstances arising from causes
beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;

                      (xii)     Payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under any
Letter of Credit against presentation of a sight draft or a certificate which
does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, provided that such
payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Issuing Bank; and

                      (xiii)    Any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, provided that such other
circumstances or happenings shall not have been the result of gross negligence
or wilful misconduct of the applicable Issuing Bank or any Lender.

               (g)    If, after the Agreement Date, any change in Applicable
Law, any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or any change
in compliance with Applicable Law by any Issuing Bank or any other Lender as a
result of any request or directive of any governmental authority, central bank
or comparable agency (whether or not having the force of law) shall (i) impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any
imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special
deposit, capital adequacy, assessment or other requirements or conditions
against letters of credit issued by any Issuing Bank or against participations
by any other Lender in the Letters of Credit or (ii) impose on any Issuing Bank
or any other Lender any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit or any
participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing in the reasonable
determination of such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, is to
increase the cost to such Issuing Bank or such Lender of issuing or maintaining
any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining any participation therein, as
the case may be, by an amount (which amount shall be reasonably determined)
deemed by such Issuing Bank or such Lender to be material, and the designation
of a different lending office will not avoid the need for (or reduce the amount
of) additional compensation, then, on the earlier of ten (10) days following the
date of demand (which demand shall be made not later than six (6) months
following such Issuing Bank's or such Lender's determination of a need for
additional compensation) by such Issuing Bank or such Lender or the Initial
Maturity Date, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Issuing Bank or such Lender,
as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as such Issuing Bank or
such Lender, as the case may be, determines will compensate it for such
increased costs. Within sixty (60) days of such written demand by such Issuing
Bank or such Lender, the Borrower may, in its discretion, provide a replacement
bank or banks for such Issuing Bank or such Lender, which replacement bank or
banks will be subject to the approval of the Arrangers and the Majority Lenders
(which approval, in each case, will not be unreasonably withheld), and shall
take all necessary actions to transfer the rights, duties and obligations of
such

                                       57
<Page>

Issuing Bank or such Lender to such replacement bank or banks within such 60-day
period. A certificate of such Lender setting forth the amount, and in reasonable
detail the basis for such Issuing Bank's or such Lender's determination of such
amount, to be paid to such Issuing Bank or such Lender by the Borrower as a
result of any event referred to in this paragraph shall, absent manifest error,
be conclusive. Such certificate shall be delivered to the Borrower with each
written demand for payment referenced above. Each Issuing Bank and each Lender
further agree that they shall use their best efforts to give the Borrower thirty
(30) days prior notice, and in any event shall give prompt notice, of any event
referred to in this paragraph which may have the effect of materially increasing
the cost to such Issuing Bank or such Lender of issuing or maintaining the
Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining any participation therein.

               (h)    Each Lender shall be responsible for its pro rata share
(based on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage) of any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses (including reasonable legal fees) and
disbursements which may be incurred or made by any Issuing Bank in connection
with the collection of any amounts due under, the administrative of, or the
presentation or enforcement of any rights conferred by any Letter of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank, the Borrower's or any Guarantor's obligations to
reimburse or otherwise. In the event the Borrower shall fail to pay such
expenses of any Issuing Bank within thirty (30) days of demand for payment by
such Issuing Bank, provided that such Issuing Bank has, during such 30-day
period, made a diligent collection effort with respect to such expenses, and
provided that such costs will not result from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of such Issuing Bank, each Lender shall thereupon pay to such Issuing
Bank its pro rata share (based on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage)
of such expenses within ten (10) days from the date of such Issuing Bank's
notice to the Lenders of the Borrower's failure to pay; provided, however, that
if the Borrower or any Guarantor shall thereafter pay such expense, such Issuing
Bank will repay to each Lender the amounts received from such Lender hereunder.

                              ARTICLE 3 - GUARANTEE

          Section 3.1 GUARANTEE. Each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally,
hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Credit Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns and the subsequent holders of the Obligations
(including, without limitation, any interest on the Loans accruing after the
filing of a petition initiating any Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such
interest accrues or is recoverable against the Borrower after the filing of such
petition for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code or is an allowed claim in such
proceeding), irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents or the Obligations of the Borrower or any of the
other Guarantors hereunder or thereunder, the value or sufficiency of any
Collateral or any other circumstance that might otherwise affect the liability
of a guarantor, that: (a) the principal of and interest on the Loans and all
other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
promptly paid in full when due, whether at stated

                                       58
<Page>

maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any
of the Loans or any other of such Obligations, the same shall be promptly paid
in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal,
whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. The foregoing guaranty
is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Failing payment when due of any
amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be obligated,
jointly and severally, to pay the same immediately.

          Section 3.2 WAIVERS AND RELEASES. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives
notice of, and consents to, any extension of time of payment, renewals, releases
of Collateral, delays in obtaining or realizing upon or failures to obtain,
perfect, or maintain perfection of, or realize upon Collateral or other
indulgence from time to time granted by any of the Credit Parties in respect of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Each of the Guarantors hereby
releases the Borrower from all, and agrees not to assert or enforce (whether by
or in a legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise), any "claims" (as defined in
11 U.S.C. Section 101(4)), whether arising under Applicable Law or otherwise, to
which such Guarantors are or would be entitled by virtue of their obligations
hereunder, any payment made pursuant hereto or the exercise by the Credit
Parties of their rights with respect to any Collateral, including any such
claims to which such Guarantors may be entitled as a result of any right of
subrogation, exoneration or reimbursement. To the extent not released by such
Guarantors under this Article 3, each of the Guarantors agrees that it shall not
be entitled to any right of subrogation, exoneration, reimbursement or
contribution in respect of any Obligations guaranteed hereby. With respect to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, each of the Guarantors hereby
waives presentment, protest, demand of payment, notice of dishonor and all other
notices and demands whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that, as
between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other
hand, (a) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated
as provided in Section 9.2 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the
event of any declaration of acceleration of such Obligations as provided in
Section 9.2 hereof, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by each of the Guarantors for purposes of this
guarantee. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article 3 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of the Borrower is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any
holder of any of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder, whether as a result of
any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will,
jointly and severally, indemnify the Credit Parties on demand for reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel) incurred by the Credit Parties in connection with such rescission or
restoration. Each Guarantor further agrees with the Borrower for the benefit of
each of its creditors (including, without limitation, the Credit Parties) that
any payment referred to in this Article 3 by a Guarantor shall constitute a
contribution of capital by

                                       59
<Page>

such Guarantor to the Borrower (or an investment in the equity capital of the
Borrower by such Guarantor).

          Section 3.3 MISCELLANEOUS.

               (a)    Upon the bankruptcy or winding up or other distribution of
assets of the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary of the Borrower or of any
surety or guarantor of any of the Obligations of the Borrower to the Credit
Parties, the rights of the Credit Parties against the Guarantors shall not be
affected or impaired by the omission of any Credit Party to prove its claim, or
to prove its full claim, and the Administrative Agent may prove such claims as
it sees fit and may refrain from proving any claim and in its discretion may
value as it sees fit or refrain from valuing any security held by it without in
any way releasing, reducing or otherwise affecting the liability to the Credit
Parties of any Guarantor.

               (b)    Each of the Guarantors absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably waives any and all right to assert any defense, set-off,
counterclaim or cross-claim of any nature whatsoever with respect to this
Article 3 or the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder or the obligations of
any other Person or party (including, without limitation, the Borrower) relating
to this Article 3 or the obligations of any other guarantor with respect to the
Obligations in any action or proceeding brought by any Credit Party to collect
the Obligations or any portion thereof, or to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantors under this Article 3.

               (c)    If a claim is ever made upon any of the Credit Parties for
the repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received by such Person in
payment of any of the Obligations and such Person repays all or part of such
amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative body having jurisdiction over such Person or any of its property,
or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Person
with any such claimant, including the Borrower, then in such event the
Guarantors agree that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise
shall be binding upon the Guarantors, notwithstanding any revocation hereof or
the cancellation of any promissory note or other instrument evidencing any of
the Obligations, and the Guarantors shall be and remain obligated to such Person
hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such
amount had never originally been received by such Person.

               (d)    The Guarantors expressly represent and acknowledge that
any financial accommodations by the Credit Parties, or any of them, to the
Borrower, including, without limitation, the extension of the Loans, are and
will be of direct interest, benefit and advantage to the Guarantors.

               (e)    The Guarantors hereby agree among themselves that if any
Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor by reason of the payment by
such Guarantor of any Obligations, each other Guarantor shall, on demand of such
Excess

                                       60
<Page>

Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding
Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as determined, for
this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such
Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment in respect of such Obligations.
The payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this
Section 3.3(e) shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other provisions
of this Article 3, and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any
right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in
full of all Obligations. For purposes of this Section 3.3(e), (i) "EXCESS
FUNDING GUARANTOR" shall mean, in respect of any Obligations, a Guarantor that
has paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Obligations, (ii)
"EXCESS PAYMENT" shall mean, in respect of any Obligations, the amount paid by
an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Obligations,
and (iii) "PRO RATA SHARE" shall mean, for any Guarantor, the ratio (expressed
as a percentage) of (A) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable
value of all properties of such Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any
other Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such
Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and any
obligations of any other Guarantor that have been guaranteed by such Guarantor)
to (B) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties
of the Borrower and all of the Guarantors exceeds the amount of all the debts
and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Rainbow Companies hereunder)
of all of the Rainbow Companies, all as of the Agreement Date. If any Subsidiary
becomes a Guarantor hereunder subsequent to the Agreement Date, then for
purposes of this Section 3.3(e) such subsequent Guarantor shall be deemed to
have been a Guarantor as of the Agreement Date and the aggregate present fair
saleable value of the properties, and the amount of the debts and liabilities,
of such subsequent Guarantor as of the Agreement Date shall be deemed to be
equal to such value and amount on the date such subsequent Guarantor becomes a
Guarantor hereunder.

               (f)    It is the intention of each Guarantor and the Credit
Parties that each Guarantor's obligations under this Article 3 shall be, but not
in excess of, the Maximum Guaranteed Amount (as herein defined). The "Maximum
Guaranteed Amount" with respect to any Guarantor, shall mean the maximum amount
which could be paid by such Guarantor without rendering the Guaranty contained
in this Article 3 void or voidable as would otherwise be held or determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in any insolvency proceeding involving any state
or any federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or other similar laws relating to the insolvency of debtors.

               (g)    Pursuant to Section 6.14 hereof, any new Subsidiary of the
Borrower is required to enter into this Agreement for purposes of joining in
this Guarantee by executing and delivering in favor of the Credit Parties a
Guarantee

                                       61
<Page>

Supplement. Upon the execution and delivery of a Guaranty Supplement by such new
Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor hereunder with the same
force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein. The execution and
delivery of any instrument adding an additional Guarantor hereunder shall not
require the consent of any party of this Agreement. The rights and obligations
of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor hereunder.

                        ARTICLE 4 - CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

          Section 4.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CLOSING. The obligation of each of
the Lenders to undertake its respective Commitments and to make the initial
Advance of the Loans hereunder is subject to the prior fulfillment of each of
the following conditions:

                   ARTICLE 5 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Section 5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Borrower, for itself
and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, hereby agrees, represents, and
warrants that:

               (a)    ORGANIZATION; POWER; QUALIFICATION. The Borrower is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, having CSC Holdings as its only shareholder. Each of the Guarantors is

view of the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires
such qualification or authorization, except for qualifications and
authorizations, the lack of which, singly or in the aggregate, has not had and
is not likely to have a Materially Adverse Effect.

               (b)    AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. Each of the Rainbow
Companies has all power, corporate or otherwise, and has taken all necessary
action to authorize it to execute, deliver, and perform this Agreement and each

<Page>

Company's incorporation or organization), the address of the chief executive
office and principal place of business of such Company, and the name and
registered office of the registered agent appointed by such Company. Except as

the extent permitted hereunder), there are no MGM Companies. With respect to

is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company
or partnership, as the case may be.

               (d)    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not (i) violate any Applicable Law, (ii) result in a breach of, or
constitute a default under the certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws
or other governing documents, as the case may be and as amended, of any of the
Rainbow Companies or any of the MGM Companies, or under any Material MSO
Agreement, or under any indenture, agreement, or other instrument to which any
of the Rainbow Companies or any of the MGM Companies, is a party or by which it
or any of its properties may be bound, or (iii) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property now
owned or hereafter acquired by any Rainbow Company except Permitted Liens;
except, with respect to items (i) and (ii) above, where such violations,
breaches or defaults, if any, singly or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
likely to have a Materially Adverse Effect.

               (e)    NECESSARY AUTHORIZATIONS. No approval or consent of, or
filing or registration with, any federal, state or local commission or other
regulatory authority is required in connection with (i) the execution, delivery
and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
to which it is a party, or (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by each
of the Guarantors of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such
Guarantor is a party. All such described action required to be taken as a
condition to the execution and delivery of each of this Agreement and other Loan
Documents to which any of the Rainbow Companies is a party has been duly taken
by all such commissions and authorities or other Persons, as the

                                       68
<Page>

case may be, and all such action required to be taken as a condition to the
initial Advance of the Loans hereunder has been or will be duly taken prior to
such initial Advance.

               (f)    TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Each of the Rainbow Companies has
good and legal title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of their
respective material properties and assets free and clear of all Liens, except
Permitted Liens.

               (g)    COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. None of the Rainbow Companies has
entered into any collective bargaining agreement with any trade or labor union
or other employee collective bargaining agent.

               (h)    TAXES. All federal, state, and other tax returns of the
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries required by law to be filed have been duly
filed, and all federal, state, and other taxes, assessments, and other
governmental charges or levies upon the Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries, and
any of their respective properties, income, profits, and assets, which are due
and payable, have been paid, except any such tax payment of which the Borrower
or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is contesting in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, and as to which neither any Lien other than a Permitted
Lien has attached nor any foreclosure, distraint, sale, or similar proceedings
have been commenced, and except any such tax payments which the failure to pay,
singly or in the aggregate, has not had and is not likely to have a Materially
Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals, and reserves on the books of the Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes are, in the reasonable judgment
of the Borrower, adequate.

               (i)    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Borrower has furnished, or
caused to be furnished, to the Credit Parties the financial statements required
pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(xvi) hereof, all of which are complete and correct in
all material respects and present fairly in accordance with GAAP the financial
position of the Rainbow Group as at the dates thereof, and the results of
operations for the periods ended as of such dates, subject to normal year-end
adjustments with respect to any unaudited statements. Except as disclosed in
such financial statements or in SCHEDULE 5.1(i) attached hereto, none of the
Rainbow Companies nor any of the MGM Companies had any material liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, and there are no material unrealized or anticipated
losses of any such Companies which have not heretofore been disclosed in writing
to the Credit Parties.

               (j)    NO ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 2001, there has

has made Investments in, advances to or guaranties of the obligations of any
Person, except as reflected in the financial statements referred to in Section

<Page>

               (l)    LIABILITIES, LITIGATION, ETC. Except (i) for liabilities
incurred in the normal course of business, (ii) as disclosed or referred to in
the financial statements described in Section 5.1(i) above, or (iii) as
disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.1(l) attached hereto, none of the Rainbow Companies has
any material (individually or in the aggregate) direct or contingent
liabilities. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.1(l) attached hereto, there is no
litigation, legal or administrative proceeding, investigation, or other action
of any nature pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against
or affecting the any of the Rainbow Companies or any of their respective
properties which involves the possibility of any judgment or liability not fully
covered by insurance that, singly or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect.

               (m)    ERISA. Each Plan maintained, or contributed to, by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their ERISA Affiliates is listed
on SCHEDULE 5.1(m) attached hereto. Each of such Plans is in compliance in all
material respects with their terms, ERISA and the Code. None of such Plans has a
material "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of ERISA or the
Code. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability to the PBGC in
connection with any such Plan. The assets of each such Plan which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA are sufficient to provide the benefits under such Plan if such
Plan were determined on an ongoing basis. No Reportable Event, for which the
thirty (30) day notice provision has not been waived in accordance with ERISA
Section 4043(a), has occurred with respect to any such Plan. No party in
interest, fiduciary, trustee or administrator of any such Plan or trust created
thereunder has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code which is not statutorily or
administratively exempt under Sections 407 or 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, each of which exemptions are disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.1(m)) which would
subject the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates to a material tax on "prohibited transactions" imposed by Section
4975 of the Code; provided that this representation and warranty is based upon
the Borrower's understanding provided by Lenders that the source of the Loans
will not at any time constitute assets of any such Plan. No party in interest,
fiduciary, trustee or administrator of any such Plan or trust created thereunder
has committed a material breach of its fiduciary duty or knowingly participated
in any violation of ERISA which would subject the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to a material penalty
under Section 502 of ERISA. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.1(m), none of the
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is
a participant in or obliged to make any payment to a Multiemployer Plan. Except
as required by Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA or as disclosed on SCHEDULE
5.1(m), Section 4980(B) of the Code and applicable state law, neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any oral or written commitments to
provide post-employment health or life insurance coverage with respect to any
former or current employee. The Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective
ERISA Affiliates have properly classified individuals providing services to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
as employees and

                                       70
<Page>

non-employees, except to the extent that a misclassification would not result in
a Materially Adverse Effect.

               (n)    PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, ETC. SCHEDULE 5.1(n) attached hereto
sets forth all registered trademarks and pending applications for trademarks of
each of the Rainbow Companies. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 5.1(n) attached
hereto (as amended by the Borrower upon written notice to the Lenders from time
to time, together with, if necessary, an amendment to the Trademark Security
Agreement reflecting the addition of any new trademarks or trademark
applications), each of the Rainbow Companies owns, possesses or has the right to
use all licenses and rights to all patents, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights, service marks, and copyrights, and rights with respect
thereto, necessary to conduct its business in all material respects as now
conducted, without known conflict with any patent, trademark, trade name,
service mark, license or copyright of any other Person, and in each case, with
respect to patents, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name and
copyrights and licenses with respect thereto owned by the Rainbow Companies,
subject to no mortgage, pledge, lien, lease, encumbrance, charge, security
interest, title retention agreement or option other than as otherwise permitted
hereunder. Except to the extent that there is not likely to be a Materially
Adverse Effect resulting from such ineffectiveness or non-compliance, all such
licenses and rights with respect to patents, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights, service marks and copyrights are in full force and
effect, and to the extent applicable, each of the Rainbow Companies is in full
compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions thereof. Except
as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.1(n) attached hereto (as amended by the Borrower upon
written notice to the Lenders from time to time), no such patent, trademark,
trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, service marks, copyrights or
licenses is subject to any pending or, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
threatened attack or revocation. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.1(n) attached
hereto, (i) none of the Rainbow Companies owns any patents or material
registered copyrights and (ii) the business of the Rainbow Companies is not
subject to any license issued by the FCC.

               (o)    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; ABSENCE OF DEFAULT. Each of the
Rainbow Companies is in compliance with all Applicable Laws the non-compliance
with which is likely to have a Materially Adverse Effect and with all of the
provisions of its articles or certificate of incorporation and by-laws, or other
governing documents, as applicable, which would adversely affect any Rainbow
Company's ability to perform the Obligations, and no event has occurred or has
failed to occur which has not been remedied or waived, the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which constitutes (i) a Default or (ii) a default by any of
the Rainbow Companies under any other indenture, agreement, or other instrument,
or under any Material MSO Agreement or Material Film Rights Agreement, or any

               (p)    CASUALTIES; TAKING OF PROPERTIES, ETC. Since the date of
the most recent audited financial statements provided to the Credit Parties by
the Borrower, neither the business nor the properties of any of the Rainbow
Companies has been materially and adversely affected as a result of any fire,
explosion, earthquake, flood, drought, windstorm, accident, strike or other
labor disturbance, embargo, requisition or taking of property or cancellation of
contracts, permits or concessions by any domestic or foreign government or any
agency thereof, riot, activities of armed forces, or acts of God or of any
public enemy.

               (q)    ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION. None of the
financial statements or any written statements delivered to any of the Credit
Parties pursuant to this Agreement contains, as at the date of delivery thereof,
any untrue statement of material fact nor do such financial statements, and such
written statements, taken as a whole, omit to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading. As of the
Agreement Date and as supplemented by the Borrower from time to time pursuant to
Section 7.4(f), SCHEDULE 5.1(q) attached hereto sets forth certain summary
information with respect to each Material MSO Agreement and each Material Film
Rights Agreement to which any of the Rainbow Companies is a party.

Companies is engaged principally or as one of its important activities in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying, and the
Borrower does not own or presently intend to acquire, any "margin security" or
"margin stock" as defined in Regulations U and X (12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224)
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (herein called "margin
stock"). None of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly,
for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose of
reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase
or carry margin stock or for any other purpose which would constitute this
transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning of said Regulations U and X.
Neither the Borrower nor any bank acting on its behalf has taken or will take
any action which would cause this Agreement or the Notes to violate Regulation U
or X or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System or to violate the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If so requested by the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish the Administrative Agent with
(i) a statement or statements in conformity with the requirements of Federal
Reserve Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U of said Board of Governors and (ii)
other documents evidencing its compliance with the margin regulations,
including, without limitation, an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders.

               (s)    SOLVENCY. The Borrower is, and each of the Rainbow
Partners is, Solvent, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Loan Documents the Borrower will be, and each of the Rainbow
Partners will be, Solvent.

                                       72

               (t)    BROKER'S OR FINDER'S COMMISSIONS. No broker's or finder's
fee or commission will be payable with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and no
other similar fees or commissions will be payable by the Borrower for any other
services rendered to the Borrower ancillary to the transactions contemplated
herein.

               (u)    BUSINESS. The Borrower is a holding company whose assets
consist of the equity interests of the Guarantors, the MGM Companies and the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The business of each of the Guarantors includes
either acting as a holding company whose assets consist of the equity interests
of its Subsidiaries or producing and acquiring various types of programming and
distributing such programming to cable and other non-broadcast delivery systems
and activities directly related thereto.

               (v)    NAME OF BORROWER. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.1(v)
attached hereto, none of the Rainbow Companies has (i) changed its name within
the five (5) year period immediately preceding the Agreement Date or (ii)
transacted business under any other name or trade name or acquired any assets
except for valid consideration.

               (w)    INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. None of the Rainbow Companies is
required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, and neither the entering into or performance by the Borrower of this
Agreement nor the making of the Loans violates any provision of such Act or
requires any consent, approval, or authorization of, or registration with, any
governmental or public body or authority pursuant to any of the provisions of
such Act.

          Section 5.2 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, ETC. All
representations and warranties made under this Agreement shall be deemed to be
made, and shall be true and correct in all material respects, at and as of the
Agreement Date and on the date of each Advance, except to the extent any
representation or warranty is made solely as of the Agreement Date in accordance
with the terms hereof. All representations and warranties made under this
Agreement shall survive, and not be waived by, the execution hereof by the
Credit Parties, any investigation or inquiry by any of the Credit Parties or the

                                       74
<Page>

               (c)    require that each insurance policy on its assets and

discharge, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, all
taxes, assessments, and governmental charges or levies imposed upon them or upon
their respective incomes or profits or upon any properties belonging to them

agreement between any Rainbow Company and the purchaser or investor, as
applicable, in such MuchMusic Company shall contain any unreasonable
restrictions, in the reasonable determination of the Arrangers, on the
Administrative Agent's ability to realize upon such Collateral, and (z) upon the
release of the Guarantee of such MuchMusic Company and the Lien of the

Document shall be taken for itself and for the ratable benefit of each of the
other Credit Parties, except as may be otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document. None of the Agents nor any of their
respective Lender Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents shall be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them hereunder or

misconduct of any agents or attorneys selected by any of them, respectively,
with reasonable care.

          Section 10.3 INTEREST HOLDERS. The Agents may treat each Lender, or
the Person designated in the last notice filed with the Administrative Agent

transfer, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, shall
have been filed with the Administrative Agent.

examine, inquire into, or pass upon the validity, effectiveness, or genuineness
of this Agreement or any instrument, document, or communication furnished

entitled to assume that they are valid, effective, and genuine, have been signed
or sent by the proper parties, and are what they purport to be.

          Section 10.6 SECURITY DOCUMENTS. The Administrative Agent, as
administrative agent hereunder and under the Security Documents, is hereby
authorized to act on behalf of the Credit Parties, in its own capacity and

to the Collateral hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall act as

such role as administrative agent shall be disclosed on all appropriate
accounts, certificates, filings, mortgages, and other collateral documentation.

          Section 10.7 ARRANGERS AND AFFILIATES. With respect to the Commitments
and the Loans, any Lender which is a Lender Affiliate of any Agent shall have
the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender, and each Agent and its
respective Lender Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Lender
Affiliates of, or Persons doing business with, the Borrower, as if it were not
affiliated with such Agent and without any obligation to account therefor.

          Section 10.8 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AGENTS. The duties and obligations
of the Agents under this Agreement are only those expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Each of the Agents shall be entitled to assume that no Default or

or has been notified by the Borrower, of such fact, or has been notified by a
Lender that such Lender considers that a Default or an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and such Lender shall specify in detail the nature
thereof in writing. None of the Agents shall be liable to any of the Lenders

          Section 10.9 ACTION BY AGENTS.

               (a)    Except for action requiring the approval of the Majority
Lenders, the Super-Majority Lenders or all of the Lenders, as the case may be,
each Agent shall be entitled to use its discretion with respect to exercising or
refraining from exercising any rights which may be vested in it by, and with
respect to taking or refraining from taking any action or actions which it may
be able to take under or in respect of, this Agreement, unless such Agent shall
have been instructed by the Majority Lenders, the Super-Majority Lenders or all
the Lenders, as the case may be, to exercise or refrain from exercising such
rights or to take or refrain from taking such action, provided that such Agent
shall not exercise any rights under Section 9.2(a) of this Agreement without the
request of the Majority Lenders. None of the Agents shall incur any liability
under or in respect of this Agreement with respect to anything which it may do
or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its judgment or which may
seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the circumstances, except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

               (b)    None of the Agents shall be liable to the Lenders, or any
of them, in acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement in accordance
with the instructions of the Majority Lenders, the Super-Majority Lenders or all
the Lenders, as the case may be, and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
to such instructions shall be binding on all Lenders.

          Section 10.10 NOTICE OF DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT. In the event that
any of the Credit Parties shall acquire actual knowledge, or shall have been
notified in writing, of any Default or Event of Default, such Credit Party shall
promptly notify the other Credit Parties, and each Agent shall take such action
and assert such rights under this Agreement as the Majority Lenders shall
request in writing, and none of the Agents shall be subject to any liability by
reason of its acting pursuant to any such request. If the Majority Lenders shall
fail to request an Agent to take action or to assert rights under this Agreement
in respect of any Default or Event of Default within ten (10) days after their
receipt of the notice of any Default or Event of Default from any Credit Party,
or shall request inconsistent action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default, such Agent may, but shall not be required to, take such action and
assert such rights (other than rights under Article 9 hereof) as it deems in its
discretion to be advisable for the protection of the Lenders, except that, if
the Majority Lenders have instructed such Agent not to take such action or
assert such right, in no event shall such Agent act contrary to such
instructions.

          Section 10.11 RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMED. None of the Agents shall be
under any liability or responsibility whatsoever as such:

               (a)    To the Borrower or any other Person or entity as a
consequence of any failure or delay in performance by or any breach by, any
Lender or Lenders of any of its or their obligations under this Agreement;

                                       97
<Page>

               (b)    To any Lender or Lenders, as a consequence of any failure
or delay in performance by, or any breach by, the Borrower or any other obligor
of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents; or

               (c)    To any Lender or Lenders for any statements,
representations, or warranties in this Agreement, or any other document
contemplated by this Agreement or any information provided pursuant to this
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any other document contemplated
by this Agreement, or for the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, or
sufficiency of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any other
document contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 10.12 INDEMNIFICATION. Each of the Lenders agrees to indemnify
each of the Agents in their respective capacities as such (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower
to do so) pro rata according to their respective Commitment Percentages, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including fees and expenses of
experts, agents, consultants and counsel), or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement or any
action taken or omitted by such Agent under this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement, except
that no Lender shall be liable to such Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses, or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent.

          Section 10.13 CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender represents and warrants to
each other and to each Agent that:

               (a)    In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
make Advances, it has independently taken whatever steps it considers necessary
to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower and that it has
made an independent credit judgment, and that it has not relied upon information
provided by any Agent; and

               (b)    So long as any portion of the Loans remains outstanding,
it will continue to make its own independent evaluation of the financial
condition and affairs of the Borrower.

          Section 10.14 SUCCESSOR AGENTS. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent (which shall be any Lender or a Lender Affiliate
or a commercial lender organized under the laws of the United States of America
or any political subdivision thereof which has a combined capital and reserves
in excess of $250,000,000) as provided below, any Agent may resign at any time
by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be
removed at any time for cause

                                       98
<Page>

by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority
Lenders shall have the right to appoint, subject to such Lender's consent in its
sole discretion, a successor Agent from among the Lenders or the Lender
Affiliates. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be any Lender or a Lender
Affiliate or a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or any political subdivision thereof which has combined capital and
reserves in excess of $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties,
and obligations of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 10.14
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent.

                      ARTICLE 11 - CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
                          AFFECTING EURODOLLAR ADVANCES

          Section 11.1 EURODOLLAR BASIS DETERMINATION INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be construed to the
contrary, if with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Advance for any Eurodollar
Advance Period, the Administrative Agent determines after consultation with the
Lenders that deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amount) are not being
offered to each of the Lenders in the relevant market for such Eurodollar
Advance Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to
the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such situation no longer
exist, the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Advances shall be
suspended.

          Section 11.2 ILLEGALITY. If any Applicable Law, or any change therein,
or any interpretation or change in interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it
unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund its Eurodollar
Advances, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders
and the Borrower. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section 11.2, such Lender shall designate a different lending office if
such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Upon
receipt of such notice, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2 hereof,
the Borrower shall

                                       99
<Page>

repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurodollar Advance
of such Lender so affected, together with accrued interest thereon, either (a)
on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Advance Period applicable to such
Advance if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such
Eurodollar Advance to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to fund and maintain such Eurodollar Advance to such day.
Concurrently with repaying each Eurodollar Advance of such Lender,
notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2 or Article 4 hereof, the
Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Advance from such Lender, and such Lender
shall make such Base Rate Advance in an amount such that the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding
principal amount of such Loans immediately prior to such repayment.

          Section 11.3 INCREASED COSTS AND TAXES.

               (a)    If any Regulatory Change:

                      (i)       Shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to its obligation to make Eurodollar Advances, or its
Eurodollar Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any
Lender of the principal of or interest on its Eurodollar Advances or in respect
of any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its Eurodollar
Advances or its obligation to make Eurodollar Advances (except for changes in
the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender imposed by the
jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal executive office is located); or

                      (ii)      Shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any
reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any included in an applicable
Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, assessment or other requirement
or condition against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
commitments or credit extended by any Lender, or shall impose on any Lender or
the eurodollar interbank borrowing market any other condition affecting such
Lender's obligation to make such Eurodollar Advances or its Eurodollar Advances;

          and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining any such Eurodollar
Advances, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender under this Agreement or in respect of its Loans, then, in any such case,
on the earlier of demand by such Lender or the applicable Maturity Date, the
Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such increased costs. Each Lender requesting
compensation will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of
any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 11.3 and will
designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need
for, or

                                      100
<Page>

reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole judgment of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

               (b)    A certificate of any Lender claiming compensation under
this Section 11.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid
to it hereunder and calculations therefor shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods. If any Lender demands compensation under this
Section 11.3, the Borrower may at any time, upon at least five (5) Business Days
prior notice to such Lender, prepay in full the then outstanding Eurodollar
Advances of such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment, along with any reimbursement required under Section 2.11 hereof.
Concurrently with prepaying such Eurodollar Advances, the Borrower shall borrow
a Base Rate Advance from such Lender, and such Lender shall make such Base Rate
Advance in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Loans
immediately prior to such prepayment.

          Section 11.4 EFFECT ON OTHER ADVANCES. If notice has been given
pursuant to Section 11.1, 11.2 or 11.3 hereof suspending the obligation of any
Lender to make Eurodollar Advances, or requiring Eurodollar Advances of any
Lender to be repaid or prepaid, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such repayment no longer apply,
all Advances which would otherwise be made by such Lender as Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be made instead as Base Rate Advances.

          Section 12.2 EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to promptly pay:

               (a)    All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Arrangers and
the Administrative Agent on the Agreement Date in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents executed on the Agreement Date, the transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder, and the making of the initial Advance
hereunder, including, but not limited to, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Administrative Agent;

               (b)    All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Arrangers and
the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation and negotiation of
any waiver, modification, amendment, or consent by the Lenders relating to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents whether or not executed, including, but
not limited to, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent;

               (c)    All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Arrangers and
the Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the Loans; and

               (d)    From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agents and the Lenders in
respect of such Event of Default, irrespective of whether suit or other
proceeding has commenced in respect thereto, which shall include reasonable fees
and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agents and the Lenders, and the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any experts, agents, or
consultants engaged by the Agents and the Lenders.

          Section 12.3 WAIVERS. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges of
the Credit Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers or privileges which
they would otherwise have. No failure or delay by the Credit Parties or the
Majority Lenders, or any of them, in exercising any right, remedy, power or
privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof. The Credit Parties expressly
reserve the right to require strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement
in connection with any funding of a request for an Advance. In the event the
Lenders decide to fund a request for an Advance at a time when the Borrower is
not in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement, such decision by the
Lenders shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the Lenders to fund
any further requests for Advances or preclude the Lenders from exercising any
rights available to the Lenders under the Loan Documents or at law or equity.
Any waiver or indulgence granted by the Credit Parties or the Majority Lenders,
or any of them, shall not constitute a modification of this Agreement, except to
the extent expressly provided in such waiver or indulgence, or constitute a
course of dealing by the Credit Parties or the Majority Lenders, or any of them,
at variance with the terms of the Agreement such as to require further notice of
their intent to require strict adherence to the terms of the Agreement in the
future.

          Section 12.4 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies now or
hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, after the applicable Maturity Date (whether by acceleration or
otherwise), the Lenders and any Lender Affiliates are hereby authorized by the
Borrower at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrower or to
any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set-off and
to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, including, but not limited to, Indebtedness
evidenced by certificates of deposit, in each case whether matured or unmatured)
and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Lenders or such
Lender Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any of the Rainbow
Companies, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of any of
the Rainbow Companies to the Lenders under this Agreement and any other Loan
Document, including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or description
arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
irrespective of whether or not (a) the Lenders shall have made any demand
hereunder or (b) the Lenders shall have declared the principal of and interest
on the Loans and other amounts due hereunder to be due and payable as permitted
by Section 9.2 hereof and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of
them, shall be contingent or unmatured. Any sums obtained by any Lender or any
Lender Affiliate shall be subject to the application of payments provisions of
Article 2 hereof. Upon direction by the Administrative Agent, with the consent
of the Majority Lenders, after the applicable Maturity Date (whether by
acceleration or otherwise), each Lender and each Lender Affiliate holding
deposits of any of the Rainbow Companies shall exercise its set-off rights as so
directed.

          Section 12.5 ASSIGNMENT.

               (a)    The Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents without the prior
written consent of each of the Lenders.

               (b)    Each of the Lenders (other than the Swing Loan Lender with
respect to the Swing Loans) may at any time enter into assignment agreements or
participations with respect to its interest hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents with one or more Eligible Assignees, provided that (x) such Lender
shall concurrently transfer to the proposed assignee or participant a pro rata
share of its corresponding commitments and loans under the AMC Loan Agreement,
(y) any such assignment, together with the concurrent assignment under the AMC
Loan Agreement related thereto, shall be in an aggregate amount, with respect to
each assignment or series of related assignments, of (A) in the case of any
assignment of the Term B Loans, not less than $500,000, and (B) in the case of
any assignment of the Revolving Loans and Revolving Loan Commitments, not less
than $5,000,000 (in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
unless such assignment is to another Lender or an assignment of all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations hereunder), and (z) after giving
effect to any assignment or series of related assignments, the aggregate amount
of the assigning

                                      105
<Page>

Lender's Loans and Commitments under this Agreement, together with such Lender's
corresponding loans and commitments under the AMC Loan Agreement, shall (A) in
the case of any assignment of the Term B Loans, not be less than $500,000, and
(B) in the case of any assignment of the Revolving Loans and Revolving Loan
Commitments, not be less than $5,000,000 (in the case of each of the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B), unless such assignment is an assignment of all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations hereunder). All of the foregoing
assignments and participations shall be subject to the following:

                      (i)       Except for (A) assignments made to any Federal
Reserve Bank or which are otherwise permitted under Section 12.5(d) below and
(B) assignments made between any Lender and any Lender Affiliate of such Lender
or to another Lender or a Lender Affiliate of another Lender or to an Approved
Fund, no assignment shall be made or sold without the consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed and, if no Default or Event of Default then exists, the consent of the
Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                      (ii)      Any Person purchasing a participation or an
assignment of the Loans from any Lender shall be required to represent and
warrant that its purchase shall not constitute a "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section 5.1(m) hereof).

                      (iii)     The Borrower and the Credit Parties agree that
assignments permitted hereunder (including the assignment of any Advance or
portion thereof) may be made with all voting rights, and shall be made pursuant
to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement which shall be delivered to the
Administrative Agent. An administrative fee of $3,500 with respect to each
Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered hereunder shall be payable to the
Administrative Agent by the assigning Lender at the time of any assignment
hereunder. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and
interest on the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement from time to time (the "REGISTER"). No assignments shall be effective
hereunder until the Loans and Commitments set forth in the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement are recorded in the Register by the Administrative Agent.
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary.

                      (iv)      No participation agreement shall confer any
rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to any purchaser thereof,
or relieve any issuing Lender from any of its obligations under this Agreement,
and all actions

                                      106
<Page>

hereunder shall be conducted as if no such participation had been granted;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any participation agreement may confer on the
participant the right to approve or disapprove changes in the interest rate and
principal amount, fees and the applicable Maturity Date.

                      (v)       Each Lender agrees to provide the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower with prompt written notice of any assignments of its
interests hereunder.

                      (vi)      No assignment, participation or other transfer
of any rights hereunder shall be effected that would result in any interest
requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
qualification under any state securities law.

                      (vii)     No such assignment, participation or transfer of
any rights hereunder may be made to any bank or other financial institution (A)
with respect to which a receiver or conservator (including, without limitation,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Office of Thrift Supervision)
has been appointed or (B) that has failed to meet any of the capital
requirements of its primary regulator or insurer.

                      (viii)    If applicable, each Foreign Lender shall, and
shall cause each of its assignees that becomes a Foreign Lender to provide to
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Agreement Date or the effective date
of any assignment, as the case may be, all appropriate Internal Revenue Service
forms required to be delivered by such Foreign Lender pursuant to Section
2.10(c)(iii) hereof.

               (c)    Except as specifically set forth in Section 12.5(b)
hereof, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall
confer on any Person other than the respective parties hereto and thereto and
their successors and assignees permitted hereunder and thereunder any benefit or
any legal or equitable right, remedy or other claim under this Agreement.

               (d)    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
any Lender may, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower,
at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, issued to such Lender to
secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or its trustee in
support of its obligations thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such pledge
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

               (e)    An assigning Lender shall retain such indemnification and
expense reimbursement rights to which such Lender was entitled pursuant to this
Agreement to the effective date of the assignment of its rights hereunder.

          Section 12.6 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and each of the other Loan
Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all such separate counterparts shall together
constitute but one and the same instrument. In proving this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in any judicial proceedings, it shall not be necessary to
produce or account for more than one such counterpart signed by the party
against whom such enforcement is sought. Any signatures delivered by a party by
facsimile transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

          Section 12.7 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF
THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW AND SECTION 327(b) OF THE NEW YORK CIVIL
PRACTICE LAWS AND RULES AND WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CONFLICT OR CHOICE OF LAW
PRINCIPLES THEREOF EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE
SECURITY INTEREST UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR REMEDIES UNDER THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR COLLATERAL ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          Section 12.8 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof in that jurisdiction or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

          Section 12.9 HEADINGS. Headings and footnotes used in this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not be used in connection with the
interpretation of any provision hereof.

          Section 12.10 INTEREST.

               (a)    In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable
hereunder or otherwise in respect of the Loans exceed the maximum rate of
interest allowed by Applicable Law, and in the event any such payment is
inadvertently made by any Rainbow Company or is inadvertently received by any
Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless
such Rainbow Company shall notify such Lender in writing that it elects to have
such excess sum returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof that the
Rainbow Companies not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly in
any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may legally be paid by
the Rainbow Companies under Applicable Law.

               (b)    Notwithstanding the use by the Lenders of the Prime Rate,
the Eurodollar Rate and the Federal Funds Rate as reference rates for the
determination of

                                      108
<Page>

interest on the Loans, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to obtain funds
from any particular source in order to charge interest to the Borrower at
interest rates tied to such reference rates.

          Section 12.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, and conversations relating to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

          Section 12.12 AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. Neither this Agreement nor any
Loan Document (other than any Interest Hedge Agreement), nor any term or
provision hereof or thereof, may be amended or waived orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the Majority Lenders (or, in the case of
Security Documents executed by the Administrative Agent, signed by the
Administrative Agent and approved by the Majority Lenders) and, in the case of
an amendment, also by the Borrower, except that (a) any decrease (other than pro
rata) or increase in the amount of the Commitments of any Lender shall require
the consent of such Lender, (b) any issuance of an Incremental Facility
Commitment shall require only the consent of the Incremental Facility Lenders,
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, (c) any amendment of Section 12.5(b)
hereof shall require the consent of the Super-Majority Lenders, and (d) in the
event of (i) any postponement in the scheduled time as set forth in Section 2.7
hereof for the payment of, or any reduction of, any scheduled payments of
principal or the rate of interest or fees due hereunder or any extension of the
Initial Maturity Date or the Final Maturity Date, (ii) any change in the
Applicable Margin as set forth in Section 2.3(f) hereof, (iii) any release or
impairment of any Collateral or Guaranties relating, directly or indirectly, to
