                  (b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be
guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to
the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution
established in Section 2.2).

                  (c) Each Guarantor agrees that the Borrower Obligations may at
any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such
Guarantor hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2
or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
hereunder.

                  (d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in
full force and effect until all the Borrower Obligations and the obligations of
each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been
satisfied by payment in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the
Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during
the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower may be free from any Borrower
Obligations.

                  (e) No payment made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors,
any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any
other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any
set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in
reduction of or in payment of the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to
modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor
hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment
made by such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or any payment
received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower
Obligations), remain liable for the Borrower Obligations up to the maximum
liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Borrower Obligations are paid in
full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are
terminated.

                  2.2. Right of Contribution. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
agrees that to the extent that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall have paid more than
its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Subsidiary Guarantor
shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of
such payment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section 2.2
shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Subsidiary
Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and each Subsidiary
Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for
the full amount guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.

                  2.3. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any
Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be
subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or
guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for
the payment of the Borrower Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be
entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any
other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until
all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower on
account of the Borrower Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall
be outstanding and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid
to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of
the

Borrower Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held
by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt
by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form
received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the
Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Borrower
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative
Agent may determine.

                  2.4. Amendments, etc. with respect to the Borrower
Obligations. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding
that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice
to or further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the
Borrower Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be
rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Borrower
Obligations continued, and the Borrower Obligations, or the liability of any
other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or
guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to
time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated,
compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, and the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended,
modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative
Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem
advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of
offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the
payment of the Borrower Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered
or released. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any
obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it
as security for the Borrower Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this
Section 2 or any property subject thereto.

                  2.5. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor
waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any
of the Borrower Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Section
2 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 2; the Borrower
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created,
contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance
upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2; and all dealings between the
Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee
contained in this Section 2. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment,
protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the
Borrower or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Borrower Obligations. Each
Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Section 2
shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Borrower Obligations or any
other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect
thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of
payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by
the Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge

of the Borrower or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Borrower
Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section
2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or
otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to,
make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may
have against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against
any collateral security or guarantee for the Borrower Obligations or any right
of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or
to collect any payments from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other
Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to
exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower, any other
Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or
right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability
hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include
the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

                  2.6. Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 2

time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Borrower Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its
property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

                  2.7. Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments
hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or
counterclaim in Dollars at the office of the Administrative Agent located at 270

Collateral which would adversely affect the ability of the Administrative Agent
to exercise any of its remedies hereunder; and

                  (b) of the occurrence of any other event which could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the aggregate value
of the Collateral or on the security interests created hereby.

                  5.7. Investment Property. (a) If such Grantor shall become
entitled to receive or shall receive any stock certificate (including, without
limitation, any certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in
connection with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any
certificate issued in connection with any reorganization), option or rights in
respect of the Capital Stock of any Issuer, whether in addition to, in
substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for, any shares of the
Pledged Stock, or otherwise in respect thereof, such Grantor shall accept the
same as the agent of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, hold the same in
trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and deliver the same
forthwith to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received, duly indorsed
by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if required, together with an
undated stock power covering such certificate duly executed in blank by such
Grantor and with, if the Administrative Agent so requests, signature guaranteed,
to be held by the Administrative Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as
additional collateral security for the Obligations. Any sums paid upon or in
respect of the Investment Property upon the liquidation or dissolution of any
Issuer shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent to be held by it hereunder
as additional collateral security for the Obligations, and in case any
distribution of capital shall be made on or in respect of the Investment
Property or any property shall be distributed upon or with respect to the
Investment Property pursuant to the recapitalization or reclassification of the
capital of any Issuer or

pursuant to the reorganization thereof, the property so distributed shall,
unless otherwise subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the
Administrative Agent, be delivered to the Administrative Agent to be held by it
hereunder as additional collateral security for the Obligations. If any sums of
money or property so paid or distributed in respect of the Investment Property
shall be received by such Grantor, such Grantor shall, until such money or
property is paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent, hold such money or
property in trust for the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor,
as additional collateral security for the Obligations.

                  (b) Without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, such Grantor will not (i) vote to enable, or take any other action to
permit, any Issuer of Pledged Stock to issue any stock or other equity
securities of any nature or to issue any other securities convertible into or
granting the right to purchase or exchange for any stock or other equity
securities of any nature of any Issuer, (ii) sell, assign, transfer, exchange,
or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, the Investment
Property or Proceeds thereof (except pursuant to a transaction expressly
permitted by the Credit Agreement), (iii) create, incur or permit to exist any
Lien or option in favor of, or any claim of any Person with respect to, any of
the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof, or any interest therein, except for
the security interests created or permitted by this Agreement or the Credit
Agreement or (iv) enter into any agreement or undertaking restricting the right
or ability of such Grantor or the Administrative Agent to sell, assign or
transfer any of the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof.

                  (c) In the case of each Grantor which is an Issuer, such
Issuer agrees that (i) it will be bound by the terms of this Agreement relating
to the Investment Property issued by it and will comply with such terms insofar
as such terms are applicable to it, (ii) it will notify the Administrative Agent
promptly in writing of the occurrence of any of the events described in Section
5.7(a) with respect to the Investment Property issued by it and (iii) the terms
of Sections 6.3(c) and 6.7 shall apply to it, mutatis mutandis, with respect to
all actions that may be required of it pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or 6.7 with
respect to the Investment Property issued by it.

                  5.8. Receivables. (a) Other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with its past practice, such Grantor will not (i) grant any
extension of the time of payment of any Receivable, (ii) compromise or settle
any Receivable for less than the full amount thereof, (iii) release, wholly or
partially, any Person liable for the payment of any Receivable, (iv) allow any
credit or discount whatsoever on any Receivable or (v) amend, supplement or
modify any Receivable in any manner that could adversely affect the value
thereof.

                  (b) Such Grantor will deliver to the Administrative Agent a
copy of each demand, notice or document received by it that questions or calls
into doubt the validity or enforceability of any outstanding Receivables
constituting a material portion of the Collateral.

                  5.9. Contracts. (a) Such Grantor will perform and comply in
all material respects with all its obligations under the Contracts.

                  (b) Such Grantor will not amend, modify, terminate or waive
any provision of any Contract in any manner which could reasonably be expected
to materially adversely affect the value of such Contract as Collateral.

                  (c) Such Grantor will exercise promptly and diligently each
and every material right which it may have under each Contract (other than any
right of termination).

                                                                              14


                  (d) Such Grantor will deliver to the Administrative Agent a
copy of each material demand, notice or document received by it relating in any
way to any Contract that questions the validity or enforceability of such
Contract.

                  5.10. Intellectual Property. (a) Such Grantor (either itself
or through licensees) will (i) continue to use each material Trademark on each
and every trademark class of goods applicable to its current line as reflected
in its current catalogs, brochures and price lists in order to maintain such
Trademark in full force free from any claim of abandonment for non-use, (ii)
maintain as in the past the quality of products and services offered under such
Trademark, (iii) use such Trademark with the appropriate notice of registration
and all other notices and legends required by applicable Requirements of Law,
(iv) not adopt or use any mark which is confusingly similar or a colorable
imitation of such Trademark unless the Administrative Agent, for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders, shall obtain a perfected security interest in such mark
pursuant to this Agreement, and (v) not (and not permit any licensee or
sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit to do any act whereby such
Trademark may become invalidated or impaired in any way.

                  (b) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not
do any act, or omit to do any act, whereby any material Patent may become
forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public.

                  (c) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) (i) will
employ each material Copyright and (ii) will not (and will not permit any
licensee or sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit to do any act
whereby any material portion of the Copyrights may become invalidated or
otherwise impaired. Such Grantor will not (either itself or through licensees)
do any act whereby any material portion of the Copyrights may fall into the
public domain.

                  (d) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not
do any act that knowingly uses any material Intellectual Property to infringe
the intellectual property rights of any other Person.

                  (e) Such Grantor will notify the Administrative Agent as
promptly as practicable if it knows, or has reason to know, that any application
or registration relating to any material Intellectual Property may become
forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination
or development (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any such
determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any court or tribunal in
any country) regarding such Grantor's ownership of, or the validity of, any
material Intellectual Property or such Grantor's right to register the same or
to own and maintain the same.

                  (f) Whenever such Grantor, either by itself or through any
agent, employee, licensee or designee, shall file an application for the
registration of any Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or
agency in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, such Grantor
shall report such filing to the Administrative Agent within five Business Days
after the last day of the fiscal quarter in which such filing occurs. Upon
request of the Administrative Agent, such Grantor shall execute and deliver, and
have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents, and papers as the
Administrative Agent may request to evidence the Administrative Agent's and the
Lenders' security interest in any Copyright, Patent or Trademark and the
goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented
thereby.

                  (g) Such Grantor will take all reasonable and necessary steps,
including, without limitation, in any proceeding before the United States Patent
and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office
or agency in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain
and pursue each application (and to obtain the relevant registration) and to
maintain each registration of the material Intellectual Property, including,
without limitation, filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use and
affidavits of incontestability.

                  (h) In the event that any material Intellectual Property is
infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor shall (i)
take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably deem appropriate under the
circumstances to protect such Intellectual Property and (ii) if such
Intellectual Property is of material economic value, promptly notify the
Administrative Agent after it learns thereof and take such actions as are
reasonably appropriate under the circumstances, including, as appropriate, to
sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution, to seek injunctive relief
where appropriate and to recover any and all damages for such infringement,
misappropriation or dilution.

                         SECTION 6. REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

                  6.1. Certain Matters Relating to Receivables. (a) The
Administrative Agent shall have the right to make test verifications of the
Receivables in any manner and through any medium that it reasonably considers
advisable, and each Grantor shall furnish all such assistance and information as
the Administrative Agent may require in connection with such test verifications.
After an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time and
from time to time, upon the Administrative Agent's request and at the expense of
the relevant Grantor, such Grantor shall cause independent public accountants or
others satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to furnish to the Administrative
Agent reports showing reconciliations, aging and test verifications of, and
trial balances for, the Receivables.

                  (b) At any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may curtail or
terminate the authority of each Grantor to collect such Grantor's Receivables.
If required by the Administrative Agent at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of Receivables, when
collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be forthwith (and, in any event, within two
Business Days) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form received, duly
indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent if required, in a
Collateral Account maintained under the sole dominion and control of the
Administrative Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders only as provided in Section 6.5, and (ii) until so turned
over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor. Each such deposit of
Proceeds of Receivables shall be accompanied by a report identifying in
reasonable detail the nature and source of the payments included in the deposit.

                  (c) At the Administrative Agent's request, at any time after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (to the extent such Grantor has
possession thereof) all documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements
and transactions which gave rise to the Receivables, including, without
limitation, all original orders, invoices and shipping receipts.

                  6.2. Communications with Obligors; Grantors Remain Liable. (a)
The Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may at any
time during reasonable business hours after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default communicate with obligors under the
Receivables and parties to the Contracts to verify with


<PAGE>


                                                                              16

them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms
of any Receivables or Contracts.

                  (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each
Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables and parties to the Contracts
that the Receivables and the Contracts have been collaterally assigned to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and that payments in
respect thereof shall be made directly to the Administrative Agent.

                  (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each
Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Receivables and Contracts to
observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and
performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement
giving rise thereto. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have
any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise
thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the
receipt by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating
thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated in any
manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any
Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any
payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment
received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party
thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any
performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been
assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

                  6.3. Pledged Stock. (a) Unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice
to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its
corresponding rights pursuant to Section 6.3(b), each Grantor shall be permitted
to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Stock and all
payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes, in each case paid in the normal
course of business of the relevant Issuer and consistent with past practice, to
the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and
corporate rights with respect to the Investment Property; provided, however,
that no vote shall be cast or corporate right exercised or other action taken
which, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, would impair the
Collateral or which would be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                  (b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and
the Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights
to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds paid in
respect of the Investment Property and make application thereof to the
Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine, and (ii)
any or all of the Investment Property shall be registered in the name of the
Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee
may thereafter exercise (x) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to
such Investment Property at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant Issuer
or Issuers or otherwise and (y) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and
subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such
Investment Property as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without
limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the
Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate structure of any
Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any
right, privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property, and in
connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the
Investment Property with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or
other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative
Agent may determine), all without liability


<PAGE>


                                                                              17

except to account for property actually received by it, but the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or
option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so
doing.

                  (c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer
of any Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with
any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (x)
states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or
further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer
shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly
permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the
Investment Property directly to the Administrative Agent.

                  6.4. Proceeds to be Turned Over To Administrative Agent. In
addition to the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders specified in
Section 6.1 with respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting
of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust
for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of
such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over
to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly
indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if required). All Proceeds
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the
Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion
and control. All Proceeds while held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral
Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the
Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided
in Section 6.5.

                  6.5. Application of Proceeds. At such intervals as may be
agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, or, if an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative
Agent's election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of Proceeds
held in any Collateral Account in payment of the then due and owing Obligations
in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and any part of such funds
which the Administrative Agent elects not so to apply and deems not required as
collateral security for the Obligations shall be paid over from time to time by
the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully
entitled to receive the same. Any balance of such Proceeds remaining after the
Obligations shall have been paid in full, no Letters of Credit shall be
outstanding and the Commitments shall have terminated shall be paid over to the
Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.

                  6.6. Code and Other Remedies. If an Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may
exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this
Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or
relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under
the New York UCC or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other
demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any
notice expressly required by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or by
law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each
of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may
in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate


<PAGE>

                                                                              18

and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell,
lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and
deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the
foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, broker's board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or
elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such
prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without
assumption of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have
the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by
law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of
the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any
Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor
further agrees, at the Administrative Agent's request, to assemble the
Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises
or elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any
action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all reasonable
costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental
to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to
the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the then due and owing
Obligations, in such order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and only after
such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other
amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section
9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the
surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the
Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them of any
rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of
Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and
proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.

                  6.7. Registration Rights. (a) If the Administrative Agent
shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock
pursuant to Section 6.6, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is
necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be
sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant
Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the
directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such
instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may
be, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to
register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the
provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the
registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain
effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of
the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, provided, that the
Administrative Agent shall furnish to the relevant Grantor such information
regarding the Administrative Agent as shall be required in connection with such
registration and requested by such Grantor in writing, and (iii) make all
amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to
cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky"
laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Administrative Agent shall designate
and to make available to its security holders, as soon as


<PAGE>
                                                                              19



practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.

                  (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may
be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of
certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more
private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged
to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account
for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each
Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices
and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and,
notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be
deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock
for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such
securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state
securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.

                  (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause
to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of
all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and
binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law.
Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in
this Section 6.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders, that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no adequate
remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and
every covenant contained in this Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable
against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except
for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the
Credit Agreement.

                  6.8. Waiver; Deficiency. Each Grantor waives and agrees not to
assert any rights or privileges which it may acquire under Section 9-112 of the
New York UCC. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to
pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.


                       SECTION 7. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  7.1. Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact,
etc. (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of
such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of
this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and
all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and
right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor,
to do any or all of the following:

                  (i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise,
         take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes,
         acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under
         any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral


<PAGE>


                                                                              20

         and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court
         of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative
         Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under
         any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral
         whenever payable;

                  (ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and
         deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments,
         documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may request to
         evidence the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' security interest
         in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles
         of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;

                  (iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or
         threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance
         called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or any part of
         the premiums therefor and the costs thereof;

                  (iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in
         Section 6.6 or 6.7, any indorsements, assignments or other instruments
         of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and

                  (v) (i) direct any party liable for any payment under any of
         the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become
         due thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the
         Administrative Agent shall direct; (ii) ask or demand for, collect, and
         receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and
         other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising
         out of any Collateral; (iii) sign and indorse any invoices, freight or
         express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts

         prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any
         court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any
         portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any
         Collateral; (v) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against
         such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (vi) settle, compromise or
         adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection
         therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent
         may deem appropriate; (vii) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark
         (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright,
         Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or
         terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Administrative
         Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (viii) generally,
         sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or
         otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as
         though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all
         purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent's option and such
         Grantor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and
         things which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect,
         preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent's
         and the Lenders' security interests therein and to effect the intent of
         this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.

                  Anything in this Section 7.1(a) to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any
rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                  (b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its
agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but
without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause
performance or compliance, with such agreement.

                                                                              21


                  (c) The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in
connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1, together
with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the highest rate per annum at
which interest would then be payable on any category of past due ABR Loans under
the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Administrative Agent to
the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to
the Administrative Agent on demand.

                  (d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and
agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are
irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests
created hereby are released.

                  7.2. Duty of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent's
sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of
the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or
otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative
Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the
Administrative Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or
realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be
under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the
request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action
whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers
conferred on the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are solely to
protect the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' interests in the Collateral
and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
exercise any such powers. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be
accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the
exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors,
employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure
to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  7.3. Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to Section
9-402 of the New York UCC and any other applicable law, each Grantor authorizes
the Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing
or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the
signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the Administrative
Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. A photographic or other reproduction
of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement or other filing
or recording document or instrument for filing or recording in any jurisdiction.

                  7.4. Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Grantor
acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative
Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option,
voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or
resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other
agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but,
as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent
shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full
and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be
under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such
authority.

                            SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS


                  8.1. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.

                  8.2. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner
provided for in Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such
notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such
Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1.

                  8.3. No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a
written instrument pursuant to Section 8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or
otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have
acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any
delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single
or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise
have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any
other rights or remedies provided by law.

                  8.4. Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Guarantor
agrees to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent (in the case
of each Lender, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default) for all its costs and expenses incurred in collecting against such
Guarantor under the guarantee contained in Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or
preserving any rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which
such Guarantor is a party, including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house
counsel (but not both outside and in-house counsel)) to each Lender and of
counsel to the Administrative Agent.

                  (b) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities with
respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise,
sales or other taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with
respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the
execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this
Agreement to the extent the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to
Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement.

                  (d) The agreements in this Section 8.4 shall survive repayment
of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.

                                                                              23

                  8.5. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their successors and assigns;
provided that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.

                  8.6. Set-Off. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent and each Lender at any time and from time to time while an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, without notice to such
Grantor or any other Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each
Grantor, to set-off and appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other
credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by the Administrative Agent or such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of such Grantor, or any part thereof in such amounts as the
Administrative Agent or such Lender may elect, against and on account of the
obligations and liabilities of such Grantor to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and description of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender against such Grantor, in any currency,
whether arising hereunder, under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document
or otherwise, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender may elect, whether or
not the Administrative Agent or any Lender has made any demand for payment and
although such obligations, liabilities and claims may be contingent or
unmatured. The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall notify such Grantor
promptly of any such set-off and the application made by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender of the proceeds thereof, provided that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The
rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Section 8.6 are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of set-off) which the Administrative Agent or such Lender may have.

                  8.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts
(including by telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

                  8.8. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  8.9. Section Headings. The Section headings used in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the
construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

                  8.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the agreement of the Grantors, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no
promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof and thereof not expressly
set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                  8.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  8.12. Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Grantor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

                  (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
         proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
         which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
         in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the
         Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of
         America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts
         from any thereof;

                  (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
         in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
         have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or
         that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
         agrees not to plead or claim the same;

                  (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
         proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
         certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
         prepaid, to such Grantor at its address referred to in Section 8.2 or
         at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified pursuant thereto;

                  (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
         effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall
         limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

                  (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
         right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding
         referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or
         consequential damages.

                  8.13. Acknowledgements. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that:

                  (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation,
         execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
         to which it is a party;

                  (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any
         fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Grantor arising out of or in
         connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and
         the relationship between the Grantors, on the one hand, and the
         Administrative Agent and Lenders, on the other hand, in connection
         herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

                  (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
         Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions
         contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Grantors and the
         Lenders.

                  8.14. Additional Grantors. Each Subsidiary of the Borrower
that is required to become a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.10 of
the Credit Agreement shall become a Grantor for all purposes of this Agreement
upon execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of an Assumption Agreement in the
form of Annex 1 hereto.

                                                                              25

                  8.15. Releases. (a) At such time as the Loans, the
Reimbursement Obligations and the other Obligations shall have been paid in
full, the Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be
outstanding, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created hereby, and
this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive
such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Grantor hereunder shall
terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by
any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. At the
request and sole expense of any Grantor following any such termination, the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to such Grantor any Collateral held by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, and execute and deliver to such Grantor such
documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.

                  (b) If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit
Agreement, then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of
such Grantor, shall execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases or other
documents reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created
hereby on such Collateral. At the request and sole expense of the Borrower, a
Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations hereunder in the
event that all the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by the Credit
Agreement; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative
Agent, at least ten Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release, a
written request for release identifying the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and
the terms of the sale or other disposition in reasonable detail, including the
price thereof and any expenses in connection therewith, together with a
certification by the Borrower stating that such transaction is in compliance
with the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  8.16 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GRANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
