                                  INTRODUCTION

     This 2002 Deferred Compensation Plan of CSX Corporation and Affiliated
Companies (the "Plan") was adopted July 9, 2002. This Plan is generally intended
to provide certain executives eligible to participate in the Tax Savings Thrift
Plan for Employees of CSX Corporation and Affiliated Companies (the "Savings
Plan") with an opportunity to defer the receipt of a portion of their salary,
and/or award(s) under the various incentive compensation plans and programs of
CSX that may be offered from time to time and to restore employer matching
contributions lost under the Savings Plan because of the application of Sections
401(a)(17), 401(k), 401(m) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Eligible executives may, if they so elect, designate all or a portion
of such deferrals to be used for payment of education expenses for one or more
members of their families. The Plan is unfunded and is maintained by CSX
Corporation and Affiliated Companies primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly-compensated
employees.

          though for all purposes of the Plan the Affiliated Companies had never

          designation shall remain in effect.

               (iii) distributions shall cease if the commencement of
          distribution was because of the Member's termination of employment
          (including retirement);

               (iv)  distributions shall continue if the commencement of
          distribution was because the Member chose a specific date or age for

     with respect to the deferral of Awards hereunder but continues to be

within such time period and on such form as the Administrator may prescribe and
shall be in integral percentages of the Member's Account balance or deferral.
The election shall be effective as of the beginning of the payroll period next
following the date the election is filed. In the event a Member does not file an
investment performance election, his Account shall be credited with earnings and
losses as if the Account had earned the same rate of return as the Stable Value
Fund under the Tax Savings Thrift Plan.

          appropriate notice with the Administrator. Such notice shall be
          effective as soon as administratively practicable following its
          receipt by the

                                       13

          educational institution in the name of one or more of:

                        (i)    each of the Member's children,

                        (ii)   each of the Member's brothers, sisters, their
                 spouses, the Member's spouse, or

                        (iii)  each of the foregoing's lineal descendants.

                 (c)    A Member may file a Distribution Election or change a
          Distribution Election at any time prior to:

                        (i)    a date that is 30 days subsequent to the date of
                 his termination of employment in the case of his initial
                 Distribution Election; or

                        (ii)   one year prior to the date distribution is to
                 commence under his Distribution Election then in effect,

                                       14

<PAGE>

          after which time no Distribution Election shall be filed.

                 (d)    A Member may make a Partial Distribution Election with
          respect to any portion of his Account or Executive Stock Account,
          provided no Distribution Election shall be made for a portion of an
          Account or Executive Stock Account less than $2,000, as determined as
          of the date the election is made. No Member shall have more than four
          Distribution Elections in effect at any time.

                 (e)    In no event may distribution made pursuant to a
          Distribution Election commence prior to a date that is three years
          subsequent to the date the Member first makes a Salary Deferral or
          Award Deferral under either this Plan, the SSP, the COIP or another of
          the Corporation's stock incentive plans for which an Executive Stock
          Account has been established.

                 (f)    For purposes of this Plan and particularly this Article
          8, if the Member's employer is involved in a Divisive Transaction, the
          Member will be considered to have terminated his employment with an
          Affiliated Company on the closing date of the Divisive Transaction,
          provide the Member's employment with his employer has not otherwise
          terminated prior to that date.

                 (g)    Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.1 or 8.2 to the
          contrary, upon death of a Member, the balance of his Account or
          Executive Stock Account shall be distributed to his beneficiary as
          soon as administratively practicable following the January 1
          coincident with or next following his date of death.

                 (h)    Any Distribution Election made in proper form by a
          Member shall be effective and distribution shall commence pursuant to
          such Distribution Election. Any Distribution Election not made in
          proper form shall be void.

          8.3    Delay of Payment

                 (a)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to a Change of
          Control, the Corporation may delay payment of a benefit under this
          Plan to any Member who is determined to be among the top five most
          highly paid executives for the year the benefit under this Plan would
          otherwise be paid; provided, however, if a Member's payment is
          delayed, the benefit to which he is entitled will not decrease after
          the date it would otherwise be distributed.

                 (b)    Notwithstanding the preceding, following a Change of
          Control, the authority to delay payment of a Member's Account or
          Executive Stock Account rests solely with the Benefits Trust
          Committee.

          8.4    Account Adjustment: The obligations of the Corporation or any
of its affiliated corporations and the benefits due any Member, surviving spouse
or beneficiary hereunder shall be reduced by any amount received in regard
thereto under the Benefits Assurance Trust or any similar trust or other
vehicle.

          8.5    Hardship Withdrawal, Forfeiture:

                                       15

<PAGE>

                 (a)    While employed by the Participating Companies, a Member
          may, in the event of a severe financial hardship, request a withdrawal
          from his Account or Executive Stock Account without filing a
          Distribution Election under Section 8.2. The request shall be made in
          a time and manner determined by the Administrator, shall not be for a
          greater amount than the amount required to meet the financial
          hardship, and shall be subject to approval by the Administrator. The
          Administrator shall consider any requests for payment under this
          Section 8.5 on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis and in accordance
          with the standards of interpretation described in section 457 of the
          Code and the regulations thereunder. The circumstances that will
          constitute a severe financial hardship will depend upon the facts of
          each case, but, in any case, no withdrawal may be made to the extent
          that such hardship is or may be relieved: (i) through reimbursement or
          compensation by available insurance or otherwise or (ii) by
          liquidation of the Member's assets, to the extent the liquidation of
          such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship.

                 (b)    For purposes of this Section 8.5 severe financial
          hardship may include any of the following circumstances:

                        (i)    illness or injury of the Member or his
                 dependents,

                        (ii)   the loss of the Member's home or its contents due
                 to casualty, or

                        (iii)  any other extraordinary and unforeseeable
                 circumstances of the Member approved by the Administrator,

          as long as those circumstances result in a present or impending
          critical financial need, including the inability to educate the
          Member's dependent child(ren).

                 (c)    Notwithstanding the preceding, a Member may request and
          receive a withdrawal from his Account or Executive Stock Account at
          any time without filing a Distribution Election under Section 8.2. Any
          such withdrawal which is not determined by the Administrator to be a
          hardship withdrawal under this Section 8.5 shall result in the
          forfeiture of an amount equal to the portion of the Member's Account
          or Executive Stock Account, as applicable, that is withdrawn,
          multiplied by the Mid-term Applicable Federal Rate determined as of
          the Valuation Date upon which the withdrawal is effective.

                 (d)    Notwithstanding the preceding, following a Change of
          Control, any decisions or determinations by the Administrator under
          this Section 8.5 shall be subject to the approval of the Benefits
          Trust Committee.

          8.6    Designation of Beneficiary: A Member may, at a time and in a
manner determined by the Administrator, designate a beneficiary and one or more
contingent beneficiaries (which may include the Member's estate) to receive any
benefits which may be payable under this Plan upon his death. If the Member does
not designate a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary, or if the beneficiary and
the contingent beneficiaries do not survive the Member, such benefits shall be
paid to the Member's estate. A Member may revoke or change any designation made
under this Section 8.6 in a time and manner determined by the Administrator.

                                       16

          8.7    Special Distribution Rules: Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Plan, if (a) a Member becomes the owner, director or employee
of a competitor of the Affiliated Companies, (b) his employment is terminated by
an Affiliated Company on account of actions by the Member which are detrimental
to the interests of the Affiliated Company, or (c) he engages in conduct
subsequent to the termination of his employment with the Affiliated Companies
which the Administrator determines to be detrimental to the interests of an
Affiliated Company, then the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, pay the
Member a single sum payment or, in the case of an Executive Stock Account, a
distribution in shares of Company Stock equal to the balance in his Account or
Executive Stock Account. The single sum payment or distribution of shares shall
be made as soon as practicable following the date the Member becomes an owner,
director or employee of a competitor, his termination of employment or the
Administrator's determination of detrimental conduct, as the case may be, and
shall be in lieu of all other benefits which may be payable to the Member under
this Plan.

          8.8    Status of Account Pending Distribution:

                 (a)    Pending distribution, a Member's Account shall continue
          to be credited with earnings and losses as provided in Section 7.2.
          The Member shall be entitled to change his investment elections under
          Section 7.3 or apply for Hardship withdrawals under Section 8.5. In
          the event of the death of a Member, his Account shall be credited with
          earnings and losses as if the Account had earned the same rate of
          return as the CSX Corporation Cash Pool Earnings Rate or, in the sole
          discretion of the Administrator, the rate of return of such other
          index of investment performance or investment fund which may be
          designated by the Administrator as a measure for investment
          performance of Members' Accounts commencing with the Valuation Date
          coincident with or next following the Member's date of death.

                 (b)    Pending distribution, a Member's Executive Stock Account
          shall continue to be credited based on the performance of Company
          Stock as provided in Section 6.2.

          8.9    One-time Re-deferral Election: A Member may make one additional
election to defer (but not accelerate) commencement of payment under the Plan at
any time six months before payments are to have commenced pursuant to Section
8.1 or 8.2 ("Re-deferral Election). Such Re-deferral Election shall be made in a
form prescribed by the Administrator. If such Re-deferral Election is to a
designated age the re-deferral shall be for a period not less than one year from
the date the Re-deferral Election is made.

          8.10   Change of Control:

                 (a)    A Member shall be eligible to make a separate
          Distribution Election which shall be effective only in the event of a
          Change of Control.

                 (b)    If a Change of Control has occurred, the Corporation and
          Participating Companies shall contribute to the Trust within 7 days of
          such Change of Control, a lump sum payment equal to the greater of (i)
          the aggregate value of the amount each Member would be eligible to
          receive (determined under (b) below) as of the latest Valuation Date
          coinciding with or preceding the date of Change of Control or (ii) the
          amount determined under Section 1(h) of the Trust attributable to

                                       17

<PAGE>

     liabilities relating to the Plan to the extent such amounts are not already
     in the Trust. The aggregate value of the amount of the lump sum to be
     contributed to the Trust pursuant to this Section 8.10 shall be determined
     by the Independent Accountants after consultation with the entity then
     maintaining the Plan's records, and shall be projected, if necessary, to
     such Valuation Date from the last valuation of Members' Accounts or
     Executive Stock Accounts for which information is readily available.
     Thereafter, the Independent Accountants shall annually determine as of a
     Valuation Date for each Member not receiving a lump sum payment pursuant to
     subsection (c) below the value of each Member's Accounts or Executive Stock
     Accounts. To the extent that the value of the assets held in the Trust
     relating to this Plan do not equal the aggregate amount described in the
     preceding sentence, at the time of the valuation, as determined by the
     Independent Accountants, the Corporation and Participating Companies shall
     make a lump sum contribution to the Trust equal to the difference.

          (c) In the event a Distribution Event has occurred, the trustee of the
     Trust shall, within 45 days of such Distribution Event, pay to each Member
     not making an election under (d) below, a lump sum payment or, in the case
     of an Executive Stock Account, a distribution in shares of Company Stock
     equal to the value of the Member's Account or Executive Stock Account
     (determined under Article 6) as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or
     next preceding the date of such Distribution Event. The amount of each
     Member's lump sum payment or Company Stock distribution shall be determined
     by the Independent Accountants after consultation with the entity then
     maintaining the Plan's records, and shall be projected, if necessary, to
     such Valuation Date from the last valuation of Member's Account or
     Executive Stock Account for which information is readily available.

          (d) Each Member may elect in a time and manner determined by the
     Administrator, but in no event later than 90 days following the Effective
     Date, to have amounts and benefits determined and payable under the terms
     of the Plan as if a Distribution Event had not occurred. New Members of the
     Plan may elect in a time and manner determined by the Administrator, but in
     no event later than 90 days after becoming a Member, to have amounts and
     benefits determined and payable under the terms of the Plan as if a
     Distribution Event had not occurred. A Member who has made an election, as
     set forth in the two preceding sentences, may, at any time and from time to
     time, change that election; provided, however, a change of election that is
     made within one year of a Distribution Event shall be invalid.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, each Member
     who has made an election under (d) above may elect within 90 days following
     a Distribution Event, in a time and manner determined by the Benefits Trust
     Committee, to receive a lump sum payment or, in the case of an Executive
     Stock Account, a distribution in shares of Company Stock, calculated under
     the provisions of (b) above determined as of the Valuation Date next
     preceding such payment, except that such calculated amount shall be reduced
     by an amount equal to such calculated amount, multiplied by the Mid-term
     Applicable Federal Rate determined as of the Valuation Date next preceding
     such payment and such reduction shall be irrevocably forfeited by the
     Member. Furthermore, as a result of such election, the Member shall no
     longer be eligible to participate or otherwise benefit from the Plan.
     Payments under this subsection (e) shall be made not later

                                       18

<PAGE>

     than 7 days following receipt by the Corporation of a Member's election.
     The Benefits Trust Committee shall, no later than 7 days after a
     Distribution Event has occurred, give written notification to each Member
     eligible to make an election under this subsection (e), that a Distribution
     Event has occurred and informing such Member of the availability of the
     election.

                           ARTICLE 9. FORM OF PAYMENT

     9.1  Timing of Distribution: Unless a Form of Payment Election is made
pursuant to Section 9.2 below,

          (a) a Member's Account shall be distributed to him, or in the event of
     his death to his Beneficiary, in a cash single sum payment as provided in
     Section 8.1.

          (b) a Member's Executive Stock Account shall be distributed to him, or
     in the event of his death to his Beneficiary, in a single distribution of
     shares as provided in Section 8.1.

     9.2 Form of Payment Election

          (a) A Member may make a Form of Payment Election to receive
     distribution of his Account or Executive Stock Account in semi-annual
     installments over a period not to exceed twenty (20) years. Installments
     shall be determined as of each January 15 and July 15 (or in the case of an
     Executive Stock Account, December 30 and June 30) and shall be paid as soon
     as administratively practicable thereafter. The amount of each installment
     shall equal the balance in the Account or Executive Stock Account as of the
     Valuation Date of determination, divided by the number of remaining
     installments (including the installment being determined). If a Member dies
     before payment of the entire balance of his Account or Executive Stock
     Account, the remaining balance shall be paid in a single sum to his
     beneficiary as soon as administratively practicable following his date of
     death. Lump sum payments shall be determined and paid as soon as
     administratively practicable following the date the Member incurs the
     distributable event elected on a Distribution Election under Section 8.2.

          (b) A Member may make a separate Form of Payment Election with respect
     to any portion of his Account for which a Partial Distribution Election has
     been made pursuant to Section 8.2(d).

          (c) A Member may change his Form of Payment Election at any time prior
     to a date that is six months prior to the date the distribution is to
     commence, after which time the Form of Payment Election shall be
     irrevocable.

     9.3  Installments and Withdrawals Pro-Rata: In the event of any payment
other than a single lump-sum, such as installment payment, partial distribution
or hardship withdrawal, such payment or withdrawal shall be made on a pro-rata
basis from the portions of the Member's existing Account balance which are
subject to different measures of investment performance.

                      ARTICLE 10. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION

     10.1 Right to Terminate:

          (a) Prior to a Change of Control, the Board may, in its sole
     discretion, terminate this Plan and the related Deferral Agreements at any
     time. Following a Change of Control, this Plan may not be terminated
     without the approval of the Benefits Trust Committee.

          (b) Prior to a Change of Control, the Committee may terminate an
     Affiliated Company's participation as a Participating Company in this Plan
     for any reason at any time. Following a Change of Control, an Affiliated
     Company may not be terminated from participation as a Participating Company
     without the consent of the Benefits Trust Committee.

          (c) Prior to a Change of Control, an Affiliated Company's board of
     directors may terminate that Affiliated Company's participation as a
     Participating Company for any reason at any time. Following a Change of
     Control, an Affiliated Company's participation as a Participating Company
     may not be terminated without the consent of the Benefits Trust Committee.

          (d) In the event the Plan and related Deferral Agreements are
     terminated, each Member and Beneficiary shall receive a single sum payment,
     or, in the case of an Executive Stock Account, a distribution in shares of
     Company Stock equal to the balance in his Account or Executive Stock
     Account. The single sum payment shall be made as soon as practicable
     following the date the Plan is terminated and shall be in lieu of any other
     benefit which may be payable to the Member or beneficiary under this Plan.

     10.2 Right to Amend: Prior to a Change of Control, the Board may, in its
sole discretion, amend this Plan and the related Deferral Agreements and
Enrollment Forms on 30 days prior notice to the Members. Following a Change of
Control, all amendments to this Plan are subject to the approval of the Benefits
Trust Committee. If any amendment to this Plan or to the Deferral Agreements or
Enrollment Forms shall adversely affect the rights of a Member, such Member must
consent in writing to such amendment prior to its effective date. If such Member
does not consent to the amendment, the Plan and related Deferral Agreements and
Enrollment Forms shall be deemed to be terminated with respect to such Member
and he shall receive a single sum payment of his Account, or, in the case of an
Executive Stock Account, a distribution in shares of Company Stock, as soon
thereafter as is practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator's
change in any investment funds or investment index under Section 7.2(b) or the
restriction of future deferrals under the salary deferral program or award
deferral program shall not be deemed to adversely affect any Member's rights.

     10.3 Uniform Action: Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary,
any action to amend or terminate the Plan or the Deferral Agreements or
Enrollment Forms must be taken in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.
Notwithstanding the preceding, any such action taken by the Administrator
following a Change of Control is subject to the approval of the Benefits Trust
Committee.

                         ARTICLE 11. GENERAL PROVISIONS

     11.1 No Funding: Nothing contained in this Plan or in a Deferral Agreement
shall cause this Plan to be a funded retirement plan. Neither the Member, his
beneficiary, contingent beneficiaries, heirs or personal representatives shall
have any right, title or interest in or to any funds of the Trust or the
Affiliated Companies on account of this Plan or on account of having completed a
Deferral Agreement or Enrollment Form. The assets held in the Trust shall be
subject to the claims of creditors of the Corporation, and the Trust's assets
shall be used to discharge said claims in the event of the Corporation's
insolvency. Each Member shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor of
the Affiliated Companies and this Plan constitutes a mere promise by the
Affiliated Companies to make benefit payments in the future.

     11.2 Obligation: To the extent reflected by resolutions of the applicable
boards of directors, obligations for benefits under this Plan shall be joint and
several.

     11.3 No Contract of Employment: The existence of this Plan, a Deferral
Agreement or an Enrollment Form does not constitute a contract for continued
employment between an Eligible Executive or a Member and an Affiliated Company.
The Affiliated Companies reserve the right to modify an Eligible Executive's or
Member's remuneration and to terminate an Eligible Executive or a Member for any
reason and at any time, notwithstanding the existence of this Plan, a Deferral
Agreement or an Enrollment Form.

     11.4 Withholding Taxes: All applicable FICA, RRTA or other employment taxes
due on deferrals under this Plan shall be withheld from non-deferred salary,
Awards or other earnings. All payments under this Plan shall be net of an amount
sufficient to satisfy any federal, state or local income tax withholding
requirements.

     11.5 Nonalienation: The right to receive any benefit under this Plan may
not be transferred, assigned, pledged or encumbered by a Member, beneficiary or
contingent beneficiary in any manner and any attempt to do so shall be void. No
such benefit shall be subject to garnishment, attachment or other legal or
equitable process without the prior written consent of the Affiliated Companies.
Notwithstanding the preceding, following a Change of Control, the Administrator
shall not implement such action without the consent of the Benefits Trust
Committee.

     11.6 Administration:

          (a) Prior to a Change of Control, the Administrator of the Plan shall
     be responsible for the general administration of the Plan, claims review,
     and for carrying out its provisions. Administration of the Plan shall be
     carried out consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

          (b) Following a Change of Control, the Benefits Trust Committee may
     remove and/or replace the Administrator.

          (c) The Administrator shall have sole and absolute discretion to
     interpret the Plan, determine eligibility for and benefits due hereunder.
     Decisions of the Administrator regarding benefits under the Plan shall at
     all times be binding and conclusive on Members, their beneficiaries, heirs
     and assigns. Notwithstanding the preceding, following a Change of Control,
     final benefit determinations for Members,

                                       21

<PAGE>

     their beneficiaries, heirs and assigns and decisions regarding benefit
     claims under the Plan shall rest with the Benefits Trust Committee or its
     delegate in its sole and absolute discretion.

          (d) Prior to paying any benefit under this Plan, the Administrator may
     require the Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary to provide such
     information or material as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall
     deem necessary for it to make any determination it may be required to make
     under this Plan. The Administrator may withhold payment of any benefit
     under this Plan until it receives all such information and material and is
     reasonably satisfied of its correctness and genuineness. The Administrator
     shall provide adequate notice in writing to any Member, beneficiary or
     contingent beneficiary whose claim for benefits under this Plan has been
     denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial. A reasonable
     opportunity shall be afforded to any such Member, beneficiary or contingent
     beneficiary for a full and fair review by the Administrator of its decision
     denying the claim. The Administrator's decision on any such review shall be
     final and binding on the Member, beneficiary or contingent beneficiary and
     all other interested persons. All acts and decisions of the Administrator
     shall be final and binding upon all Members, beneficiaries, contingent
     beneficiaries and employees of the Affiliated Companies. Notwithstanding
     the preceding, following a Change of Control, any and all decisions by the
     Administrator are subject to the approval of the Benefits Trust Committee.

          (e) Prior to a Change of Control, the Committee in its sole discretion
     and upon such terms as it may prescribe, may permit any company or
     corporation directly or indirectly controlled by the Corporation to
     participate in the Plan. After a Change of Control, such permission must be
     approved by the Benefits Trust Committee.

     11.7 Impact of Future Legislation or Regulation

          (a) This Section 11.7 shall become operative upon the enactment of any
     change in applicable statutory law or the promulgation by the Internal
     Revenue Service of a final regulation or other pronouncement having the
     force of law, which statutory law, as changed, or final regulation or
     pronouncement, as promulgated, would cause any Member to include in his or
     her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Member under the Plan on a
     date (an "Early Taxation Event") prior to the date on which such amounts
     are made available to him or her hereunder.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other Section of this Plan to the contrary
     (but subject to subsection (c), below), as of an Early Taxation Event, the
     feature or features of this Plan, or the election by a Member that would
     cause the Early Taxation Event shall be null and void, to the extent, and
     only to the extent, required to prevent the Member from being required to
     include in his federal gross income amounts accrued by the Member under the
     Plan prior to the date on which such amounts are made available to him
     hereunder. By way of example, but not by way of limiting the generality of
     the foregoing, if a statute is enacted that would require a Member to
     include in his or her federal gross income amounts accrued by the Member
     under the Plan prior to the date on

                                       22

     which such amounts are made available to him or her because of the Member's
     right to receive a distribution of a portion of his Account under Section
     8.5, the right of all Members to receive distributions under Section 8.5
     shall be null and void as of the effective date of that statute. If only a
     portion of a Member's Account is impacted by the change in the law, then
     only such portion shall be subject to this Section, with the remainder of
     the Account not so affected being subject to such rights and features as if
     the law were not changed. If the law only impacts Members who have a
     certain status with respect to the Company, then only such Members shall be
     subject to this Section.

          (c) Notwithstanding Section 11.7(b) above, if an Early Taxation Event
     occurs (e.g., if a change in law is retroactive), the amounts that become
     taxable on the Early Taxation Event shall be distributed to each
     Participant as soon as practicable following such Early Taxation Event or
     if later, the date or enactment or promulgation.

     11.8 Construction:

          (a) The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded deferred
     compensation arrangement for a select group of management or highly
     compensated employees and all rights hereunder shall be governed by and
     construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to
     the extent not preempted by federal law.

          (b) The masculine pronoun means the feminine wherever appropriate.

          (c) The captions inserted herein are inserted as a matter of
     convenience and shall not affect the construction of the Plan.
