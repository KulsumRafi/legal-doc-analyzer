<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee
is employed hereunder by the Company in a confidential relationship wherein Employee, in the course of his employment with the Company, has and will continue to become familiar
with and aware of information as to the Company's customers, specific manner of doing business, including the processes, techniques and trade secrets utilized by the Company, and future plans with
respect thereto, all of which has been and will be established and maintained at great expense to the Company; this information is a trade secret and constitutes the valuable goodwill of the Company.
In consideration for Employee's promises herein, the Company agrees to provide Employee with such confidential information; in return, Employee recognizes and acknowledges that such information must

reason or purpose whatsoever. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in Section&nbsp;3(a), "Period" shall mean one (1)&nbsp;year for Section&nbsp;3(a)(i)&nbsp;and shall mean two (2)&nbsp;years for Section&nbsp;3(a)(ii)-(v). As used in
Section&nbsp;3(a), references to the business, customers, Territory, etc. of the Company refer to the status of the Company prior to any Change in Control
(</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, such breadth of business, customers, Territory, etc. shall not automatically be expanded to include those of a successor to the Company resulting
from a Change in Control). Notwithstanding the above, the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed to prohibit Employee from acquiring as an investment not more than three percent (3%) of the capital
stock of a competing business, whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the Company as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenant, and because of the immediate and irreparable
damage that could be caused to the Company for which it would have no other adequate remedy, Employee agrees that the foregoing covenant may be enforced by the Company in the event of breach by him by
injunctions and restraining orders without the necessity of posting any bond therefor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the course of Employee's employment with the Company, Employee will become exposed to certain of the Company's confidential information and business relationships,
which the above covenants are designed to protect. It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenants in this Section&nbsp;3 impose a reasonable restraint on Employee in light of the
activities and business of the Company (including the Company's subsidiaries) on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the current plans of the Company (including the Company's
subsidiaries); but it is also the intent of the Company and Employee that such covenants be construed and enforced in accordance with the changing activities, business and locations of the Company
(including the Company's subsidiaries) throughout the term of this covenant, whether before or after the date of termination of the employment of Employee, subject to the following paragraph. For
example, if, during the Term of this Agreement, the Company (including the Company's subsidiaries) engages in new and different activities, enters a new business or established new locations for its
current activities or business in addition to or other than the activities or business enumerated under the Recitals above or the locations currently established therefor, then Employee will be
precluded from soliciting the customers or employees of such new activities or business or from such new location and from directly competing with such new business within 100 miles of its
then-established operating location(s) through the term of this covenant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is further agreed by the parties hereto that, in the event that Employee shall cease to be employed hereunder, and shall enter into a business or pursue other activities not in
competition with the Company (including the Company's subsidiaries), or similar activities or business in locations the operation of which, under such circumstances, does not violate
clause&nbsp;(a)(i)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;3, and in any event such new business, activities or location are not in violation of this Section&nbsp;3 or of Employee's obligations under this
Section&nbsp;3, if any, Employee shall not be chargeable with a violation of this Section&nbsp;3 solely because the Company (including the Company's subsidiaries) shall thereafter enter the same,
similar or a competitive (i)&nbsp;business, (ii)&nbsp;course of activities or (iii)&nbsp;location, as applicable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
covenants in this Section&nbsp;3 are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other
covenant. Moreover, in the event any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the
parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent that the court deems reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed to such extent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;All
of the covenants in this Section&nbsp;3 shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or
cause of action of Employee against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants. It is
specifically agreed that the Period following Employee's employment set forth at the beginning of this Section&nbsp;3, during which the agreements and covenants of Employee made in this
Section&nbsp;3 shall be effective, shall be computed by excluding from such computation any time during which Employee is in violation of any provision of this Section&nbsp;3. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place of Performance.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee's place of employment is the Company's headquarters in Dallas, Texas, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company. Employee understands that he may be requested by the Board to relocate from his present residence to another geographic location in order to more
efficiently carry out his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement or as part of a promotion or other increase in duties and responsibilities. In the event the Company determines that such a
relocation would significantly benefit the Company, Employee shall agree to make any such relocation (provided that Employee's obligation to relocate shall terminate in the event of a Change in
Control). In the event of such a relocation, the Company will pay all reasonable relocation costs to move Employee, his immediate family and their personal property and effects. Such costs may
include, by way of example, but are not limited to, pre-move visits to search for a new residence, investigate schools or for other purposes; temporary lodging and living costs prior to
moving into a new permanent residence; duplicate home carrying costs; all closing costs on the sale of Employee's present residence and on the purchase of a comparable residence in the new location;
and added income taxes that Employee may incur, as a result of any payment hereunder, to the extent any relocation costs are not deductible for tax purposes. The general intent of the foregoing is
that Employee shall not personally bear any out-of-pocket cost as a result of the relocation, with an understanding that Employee will use his best efforts to incur only those
costs that are reasonable and necessary to effect a smooth, efficient and orderly relocation with minimal disruption to the business affairs of the Company and the personal life of Employee and his
family. </FONT></P>

continue through December&nbsp;31, 2003 (the "Term"). Any renewal or extension of this Agreement must be in writing, signed by both parties hereto (except to the extent that such renewal is an
automatic renewal contemplated by Section&nbsp;12(b), in which case no writing shall be required). This Agreement and/or Employee's employment may be terminated earlier in any one of the following
