Borrowers have requested that Bank waive Borrowers' failure to comply with

Such Events of Default committed by Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are

correspondence is to document our mutual understandings and agreements as a
result of the Existing Defaults.

Bank hereby agrees to waive the Existing Defaults subject to the terms and
conditions expressed herein. This waiver letter ("Waiver Letter") shall serve as
evidence of such waiver as of the date of this Waiver Letter.

Except as otherwise expressly specified in this Waiver Letter, the Credit
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and is unaffected hereby. This
Waiver Letter is not intended, nor shall it, establish any course of dealing
among Borrowers and Bank that is inconsistent with the express terms of the
Credit Agreement. This Waiver Letter shall not be construed as a waiver of any
other covenants or as a consent to any other transactions.

Borrowers hereby waive and release Bank and its respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, affiliates and subsidiaries from any and all claims,
offsets, defenses and counterclaims of which

This letter may be executed in any number of counterparts, by different parties
hereto in separate counterparts and by facsimile signature, each of which when
so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute but one and the same document.

Each reference that is made in the Credit Agreement or any other writing to the
Credit Agreement shall hereafter be construed as a reference to the Credit
Agreement as modified by the terms of this letter. Except as herein otherwise
specifically provided, all provisions of the Credit Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and be unaffected hereby. This letter is a Credit Document
as defined in the Credit Agreement.

The rights and obligations of all parties hereto shall be governed by the laws
