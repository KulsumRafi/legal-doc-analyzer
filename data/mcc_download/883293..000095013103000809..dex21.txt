                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), is made and entered into this
13th day of February, 2003, by and among VALASSIS COUPON CLEARING, INC. (the
"Buyer"), VALASSIS COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Valassis"),
NCH MARKETING SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Target"), and the
stockholders of Target whose names appear on the signature pages hereto (each, a
"Seller" and, collectively, "Sellers").

                                   BACKGROUND:

Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Target
set forth opposite the name of each Seller on the Schedule of Stockholders
attached hereto as Exhibit A, which for purposes of this Agreement shall include
all of the issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of capital stock of
Target and which options shall be deemed to be fully vested and exercised
(collectively, the "Shares"). Target owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other applicable equity
interests (except to the extent that a nominee shareholder may be required
pursuant to foreign law) of the direct and indirect subsidiaries listed on
Exhibit B hereto and an approximately fifty-four percent (54%) interest in
Donations Direct, LLC. Such direct and indirect subsidiaries (the
"Subsidiaries"), to the extent that such direct and indirect Subsidiaries are
listed as Active Subsidiaries on Exhibit B hereto, are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "Active Subsidiaries," and together with Target, as the
"Target Companies."
The Target Companies are engaged in the Business (as defined in Exhibit C
hereto).
Buyer desires to and will purchase and Sellers desire to and will sell, transfer
and deliver to Buyer, the Shares on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
All capitalized (and as noted herein, uncapitalized) words or expressions used
in this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits annexed hereto) have the
meanings specified in Exhibit C hereto (such meanings to be equally applicable
to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined).
In consideration of the foregoing, the mutual representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Agreement, and for the good and valuable
consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                 THE TRANSACTION

     1.1   Sale and Purchase of the Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing:

<PAGE>

          (a) Each Seller shall sell, transfer, assign and convey the Shares
owned by such Seller to Buyer and shall deliver to Buyer a stock certificate or
certificates representing all of such Shares, duly endorsed in blank or with
duly executed stock powers attached, in proper form for transfer, with all
signatures guaranteed and with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed,
free and clear of any Lien; and

          (b) Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from each Seller all
right, title and interest in and to the Shares.

     1.2  Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration for the Shares is
Fifty-Nine Million Nine Hundred Thirty Thousand Two Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars
($59,930,225) (the "Purchase Price") payable in accordance with Section 1.5 and
subject to adjustment after the Closing as set forth in Section 1.6.

     1.3  Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall pay all stock transfer Taxes, recording
fees and other sales, transfer, use, purchase or similar Taxes resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers will, at their own expense, file
all necessary Returns (if any) and other documentation with respect to such
Taxes, fees and charges, and Sellers shall provide copies of such Returns (if
any) to Buyer at Buyer's request.

     1.4  Closing Time and Place. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of McDermott,
Will & Emery, 50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10020 at 10:00 a.m. on
February 13, 2003. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred
to as the "Closing Date." The Closing will occur and will be effective at 11:59
p.m. on the Closing Date.

     1.5  Payment of Purchase Price at Closing. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay
the Purchase Price as follows:

          (a) Buyer will pay from the Purchase Price the amounts set forth on
the Indebtedness Payoff Letters by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the respective accounts of the creditors named in the Indebtedness Payoff
Letters.

          (b) Buyer will deduct Twenty Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
($22,500) from the Purchase Price which represents one-half of the cost of the
filings under the HSR Act.

          (c) The remainder of the Purchase Price, less the Adjustment Reserve
and the Indemnification Escrow Amount, will be paid to the Disbursing Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified to Buyer
at least one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date and the Disbursing Agent
will distribute such remainder of the Purchase Price to Sellers pro rata.

              (i) Buyer will withhold from the Purchase Price an amount equal
to One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000) in respect of any
post-closing purchase price adjustments to be made pursuant to Section 1.6 (the
"Adjustment Reserve"). The Adjustment Reserve shall not be construed as a
limitation or cap on the amount of the post-closing purchase price adjustment to
be made pursuant to Section 1.6.

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

               (ii)   In addition, the aggregate amount payable to Sellers will
be reduced by Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Indemnification Escrow
Amount"), which amount will be deposited by Buyer with an escrow agent (the
"Indemnification Escrow Agent") appointed in accordance with the terms of the
escrow agreement (the "Indemnification Escrow Agreement") substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D.

     1.6  Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

          (a)  After the Closing and within five (5) business days following the
final determination of the Working Capital of Target:

               (i)    Sellers will be liable to Buyer for the amount, if any, by
which the Working Capital of Target stated in the Closing Balance Sheet is less
than negative Seventeen Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($17,700,000),
which amount will be credited against the Adjustment Reserve. If such amount is
greater than the Adjustment Reserve, then the Sellers shall pay such excess to
Buyer.

                      For example, if the Working Capital of Target stated in
the Closing Balance Sheet is negative Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($19,500,000), Seller will be liable to Buyer for an aggregate of One
Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,800,000), One Million Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000) of which will be paid by Buyer retaining the
entire Adjustment Reserve and the remaining Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($550,000) will be paid by Sellers pro rata.

               (ii)   If the amount payable by Sellers pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(i) above is less than the Adjustment Reserve, Buyer will pay the
difference between the Adjustment Reserve and such amount to the Disbursing
Agent, who shall distribute such amount pro rata to Sellers.

               (iii)  If the Working Capital of Target stated in the Closing
Balance Sheet is greater than negative Seventeen Million Seven Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($17,700,000), then Buyer shall pay to the Disbursing Agent, who shall
distribute such sum pro rata to Sellers, an amount equal to the sum of (x) the
Adjustment Reserve, plus (y) the difference between (A) negative Seventeen
Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($17,700,000), and (B) the Working
Capital of Target stated in the Closing Balance Sheet.

                      For example, if the Working Capital of Target stated in
the Closing Balance Sheet is negative Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000),
Buyer will be liable to Sellers for Two Million Nine Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($2,950,000), which amount includes the $1,250,000 Adjustment Reserve.

          (b)  Working Capital of Target shall be calculated in accordance with
the following terms and provisions:

               (i)    Model Computation. Set forth on Exhibit E hereto is the
method by which the Working Capital of Target will be calculated (the "Model
Computation").

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

               (ii)   Closing Working Capital. Buyer shall cause NCH to prepare
and deliver to the Seller Representative, not later than forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, a consolidated balance sheet of the Target Companies as
of January 31, 2003 (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, on a basis consistent with past practice and NCH shall
include a calculation of the Working Capital of Target at January 31, 2003
determined in accordance with the Model Computation and which shall include any
additional accruals that would have been made had the transactions contemplated
hereby been consummated on January 31, 2003. Unless the Seller Representative
gives Buyer and NCH a Disagreement Notice pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(iii) within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance
Sheet delivered in accordance with this Section 1.6(b)(ii) will be final,
binding, and conclusive upon Sellers and Buyer and will be used to determine the
adjustment payments pursuant to Sections 1.6(a)(i), 1.6(a)(ii) and 1.6(a)(iii).

               (iii)  Disputes. If the Seller Representative disagrees in good
faith with the Closing Balance Sheet, the Seller Representative shall give Buyer
and NCH written notice of all items with which it disagrees within fifteen (15)
days of receipt by the Seller Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Disagreement Notice"). Buyer and the Seller Representative shall then negotiate
in good faith for a period of twenty (20) days following receipt of the
Disagreement Notice by the Seller Representative to resolve any such
disagreement. If after such twenty (20) days, Buyer and the Seller
Representative still disagree, any such disagreement shall be promptly submitted
to a Neutral Firm, which shall deliver to Buyer and the Seller Representative,
as promptly as practicable, a written report of its determination of the Closing
Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date, which will be no more favorable to Sellers
than reflected in the Disagreement Notice and shall be no more favorable to
Buyer than reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet. The Neutral Firm shall
consider only those items as to which the Seller Representative has disagreed
and which remain unresolved between Buyer and the Seller Representative. The
determination made by the Neutral Firm will be conclusive and binding on and
non-appealable by the parties hereto.

               (iv)   Expenses. If the Working Capital of Target as of the date
of the Closing Balance Sheet, as determined by the Neutral Firm, is more than
ten percent (10%) favorable to Sellers than the amount determined in accordance
with the Closing Balance Sheet prepared by NCH, Buyer shall bear the costs and
expenses of the Neutral Firm. In all other cases, the Sellers shall bear the
costs and expenses of the Neutral Firm, which costs and expenses may be paid
directly by Buyer from the Adjustment Reserve.

     1.7  Seller Representative. PPM America Special Investments Fund, L.P. and
PPM America Special Investments CBO II, L.P., acting through PPM America, Inc.
their agent and attorney-in-fact, are hereby jointly appointed and designated as
the agent and attorney-in-fact for Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement
(the "Seller Representative"). Such power shall include the power and authority
to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of each Seller the Indemnification

Agreement. The Seller Representative may resign at any time by giving two (2)
business days' prior written notice to all the parties to this Agreement, which
resignation shall be effective upon the effective appointment of a replacement
Seller Representative in accordance with the immediately following sentence. If
either PPM America Special Investments Fund, L.P. or PPM America Special
Investments CBO II, L.P. resigns as the Seller Representative, the other shall
also be deemed to have resigned as the Seller Representative. In addition, such
appointment and designation may be terminated at any time, and a new Seller
Representative may be appointed, by notice in writing by Sellers holding at
least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Shares, which notice shall be delivered to
each party to this Agreement. The parties are authorized to rely conclusively on
all actions of the Seller Representative as binding upon each Seller. The Seller
Representative and the Disbursing Agent are hereby indemnified and held harmless
by each Seller, jointly and severally, from and against all loss, cost, expense
and liability arising out of his or her actions and omissions, except to the
extent arising out of the Seller Representative's or the Disbursing Agent's
willful misconduct or intentional malfeasance.

     1.8  Foreign Closings. Except as may be otherwise mutually agreed by the
parties, to the extent that any closing of the sale and purchase of any of the
Subsidiary Shares (which for purposes of this Section 1.8 shall also include the
shares of capital stock or other applicable equity interests of the Inactive
Subsidiaries) cannot be achieved by the purchase and sale of the Shares and the
purchase and sale of such Subsidiary Shares is required to occur in a separate
transaction at a place outside of the United States (whether by reason of
notarial deed or otherwise), such a closing (a "Foreign Closing") shall take
place, and the executed closing documents shall be held in escrow by the agent
mutually appointed by the Seller Representative and Buyer, on or prior to the
Closing (but not prior to the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 relating to such Foreign Closing and the conditions contained in the
Foreign Agreements) at such times and places as may be agreed by the Seller
Representative and Buyer. The agent shall hold all such executed documents until
such time as it is advised in a writing signed by the Seller Representative and
Buyer that the transactions contemplated hereby have been consummated or
terminated. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the agent
shall deliver to each party one fully executed set of the documents that were
being held in escrow by the agent. If the transactions contemplated hereby are
terminated, the agent shall deliver to each party the documents executed by such
party that were held in escrow by the agent.

     In certain instances the sellers of certain of the Subsidiary Shares may
execute with Buyer a separate acquisition agreement as may be required with
respect to such Subsidiary Shares (the "Foreign Agreements"). The Foreign
Agreements are intended to serve only as the operative documents of transfer,
and such Foreign Agreements do not alter, modify or amend in any way any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, terms and
provisions relating to representations and warranties and indemnification. To
the extent that any conflict exists between any of the terms of any of the
Foreign Agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
control.

claimed or given to a Foreign Subsidiary which could be withdrawn, postponed,
restricted or otherwise reduced or lost as a result of any act, omission, event
or circumstance by or of Target or the Target Companies arising or occurring at
any time before or after the Closing Date.

     3.12 Accounts Receivable. All of the accounts and notes receivable of each
Target Company, to the extent that such accounts and notes receivable are
attributable to the revenues of any Target Company (as opposed to accounts and
notes receivable for which any Target Company records an offsetting liability

notes represent amounts receivable in respect of other bona-fide business
transactions), have arisen in the ordinary course of business, are free of any
Lien are not, to the best knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, subject to any
counterclaims or offsets and have been billed (or will be billed within one (1)

Financial Statements. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the total amount of accounts or
notes receivable of each Target Company outstanding as of a date not more than
thirty (30) days prior to the date hereof.

     3.13 Litigation and Claims. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, there is
no Claim pending or, to the best knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, overtly
threatened (or, to the best knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, no state of
facts exist which reasonably could be expected to lead to any such Claim) by any
Person, against any Target Company or relating to any material Target Asset
before any Governmental Authority, or any arbitrator. There are presently no
outstanding judgments, decrees, or orders of any Governmental Authority, any
arbitrator or any other Person against any Target Company or Target Asset. No
individual Claim listed on Schedule 3.13, if determined adversely to the Target

the Insider Stockholders, as to any other party and, with respect to such
Contracts, there is no material default by any Target Company or, to the best
knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, by any other party, and no event which,
with notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute such a default by
any Target Company, or, to the best knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, by
any other party. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(a), the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not deprive the Target Companies of
the existing economic, legal and other benefits of such Contracts currently
enjoyed by the Target Companies. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(a), no
party has any right to cancel, terminate or modify any of the Contracts listed
on Schedule 3.14(a) by reason of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement. To the best knowledge of the Insider Stockholders, no Target Company
has received notice that a Contract listed on Schedule 3.14(a)(i) that has
expired or is "pending" will not be renewed or executed.

     3.15 Environmental Matters; Worker Health & Safety Matters.

          (a)  No material quantity of Hazardous Substances has been generated,
transported, used, disposed, stored or treated by any Target Company, except
that the Target Companies have used such quantities of petroleum products as are

material respects. There is no pending or overtly threatened civil or criminal

contemplated will not deprive the Target Companies of the existing economic,

date, and any pending Claims thereunder, excluding routine medical insurance
Claims. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.24, all such policies are in full

since January 13, 1998, no notice of cancellation (which has not been corrected)
or non-renewal with respect to, or disallowance of any Claim under, any such
policy has been received; no Target Company has ever been refused any insurance,
nor has any coverage been limited by any insurance carrier to which an
application for insurance was made or with which insurance was carried resulting
in insurance coverage less than is reasonably prudent and standard in the
industry in which the Target Companies operate; and all general liability
policies maintained by or for the benefit of the Target Companies have been
"occurrence" policies.

     3.25 Employee Benefit Plans.

          (a)  Schedule 3.25 sets forth a complete and correct list of all
employee benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and all employment,
compensation, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive,
deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, split dollar

benefit plans, programs, arrangements or fringe benefits, in each case, which
are provided, maintained, contributed to or sponsored by any of the Target
Companies on behalf of current or former directors, officers or employees of any
of the Target Companies, or for which any of the Target Companies has any
liability, contingent or otherwise (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). Schedule
3.25 separately lists all Benefit Plans that are maintained or contributed to

(the "U.S. Benefit Plans"), and (ii) any covered participants employed outside

(i) the plan document or other governing contract for each Benefit Plan, as
amended, and a summary of any unwritten Benefit Plans, (ii) with respect to each
U.S. Benefit Plan, the most recently distributed summary plan description and
summary of material modifications, and any equivalent

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

summary description prepared or required for each Foreign Benefit Plan, (iii)
each trust or other funding agreement with respect to each Benefit Plan, (iv)

respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan, (v) with respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan,
the most recently received IRS determination letter and application therefor,
and (vi) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statements
for each Benefit Plan.

          (c)  The Benefit Plans have been operated and administered in
accordance with their terms and the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code
and any other applicable governing law. All contributions and all payments and
premiums required to have been made to or under any Benefit Plan have been
timely and properly made (or otherwise properly accrued if not yet due), and
nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of the Benefit Plans that
would cause the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA, the
Code or governing law (including, without limitation, applicable foreign laws).

          (d)  No U.S. Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, or a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)(A) of ERISA. Neither the
Target Companies nor any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which
is or has ever been treated as a single employer with the Target Companies under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliates"), has incurred
any liability under title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, except for
such liability that has been paid in full.

          (e)  For each Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan
within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87 ("SFAS
87"), and including, without limitation, any such Foreign Benefit Plan), the
"projected benefit obligation" of each such plan does not exceed the market
value of its "plan assets" as of December 31, 2002, as such terms are defined in
SFAS 87.

          (f)  There are no pending or, to best knowledge of the Insider
Stockholders, threatened suits, audits, examinations, actions, litigation or
claims (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course) with
respect to any of the Benefit Plans.

          (g)  Each of the U.S. Benefit Plans which is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS and no event has occurred and no

     8.2  Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either Seller or Buyer, as provided above, this Agreement shall terminate as
of the date of the written notice or consent described in Section 8.1, and there
will be no liability on the part of Seller or Buyer or their respective
Affiliates, except for liabilities arising from a breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination; provided, however, that the obligations of the parties set
forth in Sections 9.1 hereof shall survive such termination and Target shall be
required to pay to Buyer Twenty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($22,500)
representing one-half of the filing fee for filings pursuant to the HSR Act, and
provided, further, that if Buyer terminates this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(b) as a result of the occurrence of any event with respect to which
Sellers have indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iv), then
neither Sellers nor Target shall be liable for any indemnification obligations
pursuant thereto other than Buyer's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
investigating any such event prior to the termination date.

                          CERTAIN ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

     9.1  Costs and Expenses. Each party hereto will pay its own costs and
expenses, including legal and accounting fees, in connection with the
negotiation, execution, performance of and compliance with this Agreement and,
except as otherwise provided herein, none of such costs and expenses shall be
paid by the Target Companies.

     9.2  No Solicitation. For a period of eighteen (18) months from and after
the Closing Date, no Seller nor any Affiliate thereof will, directly or
indirectly, solicit or attempt to entice away from any Target Company any
employee who is then currently employed or retained by such Target Company;
provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller and its Affiliates from
employing any individuals who have received notice of termination from, or cease
to be employed by, any Target Company prior to the first time such individuals
discussed with any representative of Seller or its Affiliates employment by
Seller or any of its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 9.2, the parties
agree that a public advertisement does not constitute a solicitation.

     9.3  Non-Competition. For a period of forty-two (42) months after the
Closing Date, no Seller listed on Schedule 9.3 (other than Brian Husselbee, Wan
Ling Martello and Charles Macaluso, with respect to whom the provisions of this
Section 9.3 shall run for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date or for such other period as may be set forth in the then-current
employment agreement between Target and any of them) and no Person controlled,
directly or indirectly, by any such Seller (including Brian Husselbee, Wan Ling
Martello and Charles Macaluso) may, directly or indirectly, alone or in
association with any other Person, engage in, or carry on, or be engaged or
concerned in, solicit on behalf of, take part in or render consulting services
to, or own, share in the earnings of, or invest in the stock, bonds or other
securities of, any Person engaged in any business where twenty (20%) percent or
more of such Person's revenue is derived from services in direct competition
with the Business (a "Competitive Business"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
of the following activities shall not be a violation of the provisions of this
Section 9.3:

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

          (a)  the ownership of no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of any
class of debt securities as a passive investment;

          (b)  five percent (5%) or less of any class of equity securities that
are publicly traded; or

          (c)  passive investments in mutual funds or in limited partnerships as

     9.4  Adjustments to Purchase Price. Amounts payable in respect of the
indemnification obligations under Sections 10.2 and 10.2(c) hereof shall be

     9.5  Tax Matters.

          (a)  Target is responsible for the preparation and filing of all
Returns of the Target Companies for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date. Such Returns will be correct and complete and Target will cause
them to be timely filed with all relevant Taxing Authorities. If any such
Returns are to be filed prior to Closing, Buyer will be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such Returns before they are filed. If
any such Returns are to be filed after Closing, the Seller Representative will
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such Returns before
they are filed.

          (b)  Contests.

               (i)  Sellers and Buyer agree, in each case at no cost to the
other party, to cooperate with the other and the other's representatives in a
prompt and timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall
include, but not be limited to, making available to the other party, during
normal business hours, all books, records, returns, documents, files, other
information (including, without limitation working papers and schedules),
officers or employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or other
relevant information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest
requiring any such books, records and files. Sellers shall, at their election,
have the right to represent a Target Company's interests in any Contest relating
to a Tax matter arising in, or related to, a Pre-Closing Period to the extent
such Contest is in connection with any Taxes for which Sellers may be liable
pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, to employ counsel of their choice at their
expense and to control the conduct of such Contest, including Settlement or
Other Disposition thereof; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to
consult with Sellers regarding any such Contest that may affect a Target Company
for any periods ending after the Closing Date, at Buyer's own expense, and
provided further, that any settlement or other disposition of any such Contest
may only be made with the consent of Buyer, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld. In connection with any Contest which is controlled by
Sellers pursuant to this Section 9.5(b), no Seller shall, without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (A)
make any election, change any annual accounting period, or adopt or change any
accounting method if such election, adoption or change would have the effect of
increasing the tax liability of Buyer, or its Affiliates or any of the Target
Companies in any Tax Period ending after the Closing Date, or (B) file any
amended return, enter into any closing agreement, surrender any right to claim a

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

refund of taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any tax claim or assessment relating to the Target Companies or
take any action, if such amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, consent of
other action would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the
liability for Taxes of Buyer, its Affiliates, or any of the Target Companies for
or with respect to any Tax Period ending after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (A) make any election, change any annual accounting
period, or adopt or change any accounting method if such election, adoption or
change would have the effect of increasing liability for Taxes in any Tax Period
ending on or before the Closing Date, or (B) file any amended return, enter into
any closing agreement, surrender any right to claim a refund of taxes, consent
to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any tax claim
or assessment relating to the Target Companies or take any action, if such
amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, consent of other action would have
the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the liability for Taxes for or
with respect to any Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall the right to
control any Contest with respect to Straddle Periods of the Target Companies.

               (ii)  Unless Sellers have previously received written notice from
Buyer or the Target Companies of the existence of a Contest, Sellers shall give
written notice to Buyer of the existence of any Contest relating to a Tax matter
that is Buyer's responsibility pursuant to this Agreement within twenty (20)
days from the date of receipt by a Seller of any written notice of such Contest
by a Taxing Authority; provided that failure to give such notice shall relieve
Buyer of any liability with respect to such Contest unless Buyer was otherwise
aware of such Contest or the failure to give such notice did not result in
additional expenses or otherwise prejudice the Buyer. Unless the Buyer has
previously received written notice from Sellers of the existence of a Contest,
Buyer shall give written notice to Sellers of the existence of any Contest for
which Sellers may have responsibility within twenty (20) days from the receipt
by the Buyer of any written notice of such Contest by a Taxing Authority;
provided that failure to give such notice shall relieve Sellers of any liability
with respect to such Contest unless the Insider Stockholders were otherwise
aware of such Contest or the failure to give such notice did not result in
additional expenses or otherwise prejudice Sellers.

          (c)  All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to
or involving the Target Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date to
the extent any Target Company has the power to terminate any such agreement and,
after the Closing Date, Target and the Target Companies shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability under any such agreement which Target has the
power to terminate and that was required to be terminated pursuant to this
Section 9.5(c). Schedule 9.5 sets forth a list of all Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements with respect to or involving Target or a Target Company, and
a copy of each such agreement has been provided to Buyer.

     9.6  Section 338 Election. Neither Buyer nor any of the Target Companies
will make an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                      -35-

     9.7  Confidentiality.

          (a)  Each Seller shall maintain in strict confidentiality, and shall
not disclose to any Person for any purpose whatsoever, any non-public
information concerning any Target Company or any customer of any Target Company
or developed by any Target Company, and each Seller shall return to Target any
such information reduced to a concrete form that is in its possession or
control.

          (b)  For purposes Section 9.7, the term non-public information does
not include information which (i) becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) was
available to a Seller on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to a
Seller by a Target Company, (iii) was developed independently by a Seller, as
evidenced by the written records of such Seller prepared contemporaneously with
such independent development, or (iv) was received by a Seller in good faith
from a third party lawfully in possession thereof and having no obligation to
keep such information confidential.

          (c)  If any Seller is requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such information, such
Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of such request or requirement so
that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive such Seller's
compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.7. If such protection is not
obtained or Buyer waives in writing compliance with this Section 9.7, such
Seller shall furnish only that portion of such information that such Seller is
advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed.

          (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Seller shall be liable for the breach by any other Seller of the covenants
contained in this Section 9.7, unless such breaching Seller was, at the time of
such breach, controlled by or under common control with or acting in concert
with such other Seller.

     9.8  Donations Direct. Subject to the accuracy of the last sentence of
Section 3.32, Buyer shall cause Target to dissolve Donations Direct, LLC as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date.

     9.9  Post-Closing Matters. If, within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date or later, in the event that Buyer does not have access to the relevant
information through no fault of its actions to make such determination, Buyer
determines to take the actions specified in Exhibit H for the reasons set forth
therein, Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for one-half of the costs specified in
Exhibit H; provided, however, that Buyer only must make such determination
within sixty (60) days after such information becomes available to Buyer and
Buyer shall notify the Seller Representative at such time of such determination
but does not have to actually take such actions within such period.

          (b)  Tax Matters. The representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.11 entitled "Taxes" shall survive the Closing until sixty (60) days
after the first to occur of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and any extensions thereof) applicable to the Tax in respect of which
indemnification is being sought without the assertion of a deficiency in respect
thereof by the applicable Taxing Authority, or (ii) the completion of the final
audit and determination by the applicable Taxing Authority with respect to such
Tax and final determination of any deficiency resulting therefrom pursuant to
Section 1313 of the Code or any analogous provision under foreign law, if
applicable.

     10.2 Indemnification by Sellers.

          (a)  Subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.4, each Seller
shall severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its officers,
directors, employees, consultants, owners, agents and Affiliates (including the
Target Companies), regardless of any investigation made by Buyer or on its

and expenses of any kind and nature whatsoever (including interest and
penalties, reasonable expenses of investigation and court costs, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements and the reasonable fees and disbursements of
other professionals incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same
or in asserting any of their respective rights hereunder) (collectively,
"Losses") which may be sustained or suffered by any of them arising out of or
resulting from any breach of, or misrepresentation contained in, any
representation or warranty made by such Seller in Article 2; provided, however,
that such Seller's obligation under this Section 10.2(a) with respect to Losses
shall not exceed in the aggregate the consideration such Seller received for the
Shares.

          (b)  Subject to the limitations contained in Section 10.4, each Seller
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its
officers, directors, employees, consultants, owners, agents and Affiliates

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

of any and all Losses which may be sustained or suffered by any of them arising
out of, resulting from or pertaining to:

               (i)   any breach of, or misrepresentation contained in, any
representation or warranty made by the Insider Stockholders in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement regardless of when such
breach or misrepresentation was discovered;

               (ii)  any failure of any Insider Stockholder to perform any
covenant or agreement hereunder or fulfill any other material obligation in
respect hereof;

               (iii) all Taxes of Target and the Target Companies for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the
end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date; all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group (or similar regime) of which Target or any of the
Target Companies (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date, and with respect to which Treasury Regulations
(S) 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or
regulation would apply; and any and all Taxes of any Person (other than Target
and the Target Companies) imposed on Target or the Target Companies as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date; provided, however, that
any net operating loss, credit, deduction, allowance or carryback otherwise
applicable and available that originates in any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date shall be utilized by Buyer, to the extent reasonably
possible, to mitigate any amount otherwise owing to Buyer under this Section
10.2(b)(iii); and provided further, that for purposes of this Section
10.2(b)(iii), the amount of Taxes otherwise indemnifiable by Sellers to Buyer
shall include any net tax increase to Buyer from the loss, in whole or part, of
any deduction, credit, allowance or other Tax benefit of a Target Company
otherwise available to Buyer which is reduced, eliminated or otherwise
unavailable to Buyer as a result of a Contest with respect to a taxable period
ending on or before, or other event or transaction occurring before, the Closing
Date, and which deduction, credit, allowance or other Tax benefit shall not have
been restored to the Buyer in another tax year or tax period within three (3)
years of such Contest;

               (iv)  the manner in which the Insider Stockholders have
negotiated the sale of Target with any other Person; and

               (v)   any judgment on the merits by a court of competent
jurisdiction which is adverse to any Target Company with respect to the subject
matter disclosed in item 11 of Schedule 3.13.

          (c)  For purposes of this Section 10.2, in the case of any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of
Target and the Target Subsidiaries shall be determined based upon an interim
closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for
such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity
in which Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount of other Taxes of
Target and the Target Subsidiaries for

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

a Straddle Period which related to the pre-Closing Date taxable period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in
such Straddle Period.

     10.3 Indemnification by Buyer and Valassis. Each of Buyer and Valassis
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, their officers,
directors, employees, consultants, owners, agents and Affiliates, for, against,
from and in respect of any and all Losses which may be sustained or suffered by
any of them arising out of, resulting from or pertaining to:

          (a)  any breach of, or any misrepresentation contained in, any
representation or warranty made by Buyer or Valassis in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement regardless of when such breach
or misrepresentation was discovered;

          (b)  any failure of Buyer or Valassis to perform any covenant or
agreement hereunder or fulfill any other obligation in respect hereof; or

          (c)  any and all Taxes due and payable by any Target Company for any
taxable year or tax period beginning after the Closing Date, provided that Buyer
shall be entitled to utilize any net operating loss, credit, or other carryovers
that relate to any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that would
otherwise be available for such tax year or tax period beginning after the
Closing Date, that otherwise have not been utilized by Sellers in respect of
Taxes of Target Companies for Tax years or Tax periods prior to the Closing
Date, and, provided further, that Buyer shall be entitled to elect, in its sole
discretion, to forego any net operating loss, credit or other carryback that
relates to any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 9.5 hereof, Buyer shall have the sole
obligation and right to exercise, at its own expense, control at any time over
the handling, disposition and/or settlement of any issue raised in any official
inquiry, examination or proceeding (including the right to settle or otherwise
terminate any Contest with respect thereto) regarding any tax return relating to
the Company for any taxable period commencing after the Closing Date so long as
such settlement or disposition for any Tax period after the Closing Date does
not increase any Indemnifiable Loss or Tax liability payable by Sellers for
which Sellers are responsible under this Agreement unless Buyer shall fully
indemnify or credit Sellers for such increased Tax cost or Indemnifiable Loss,
as the case may be.

     10.4 Limitations.

          (a)  Sellers' Maximum Liability. The aggregate obligation of Sellers,
including the Insider Stockholders, to indemnify Buyer for any Losses under
Section 10.2(a) (other than Losses arising out of a breach of, or
misrepresentation contained in, the representation and warranty in each of
Sections 2.3 and 2.8), Section 10.2(b)(i) (other than Losses arising out of a
breach of, or misrepresentation contained in, the representations and warranties
in each of Sections 3.4, 3.28 and 3.33), Section 10.2(b)(ii) and Section
10.2(b)(v) shall not exceed an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000). With respect to indemnification obligations under each of
Sections 10.2(a), 10.2(b)(i), 10.2(b)(ii), 10.2(b)(iii) and 10.2(b)(v) no Seller
shall be liable to Buyer for an amount greater than such Seller's pro rata
portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller.

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

          (b)  Buyer's Maximum Liability. The aggregate obligation of Buyer and
Valassis to indemnify Sellers for any Losses under this Article 10 shall not
exceed an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

          (c)  Minimum Claim Amount. No Claim may be made for indemnification of
any Losses (other than Losses arising out of a breach of, or misrepresentation
contained in, the representation and warranty in each of Sections 2.3, 2.8, 3.4,
3.28 and 3.33 and Losses and arising out of the matters covered by each of
Section 10.2(b)(iv), with respect to which this Section 10.4(c) shall not apply)
by any Seller unless such Claim for Losses individually exceeds Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000); provided, however, that in the case of any Claim for Losses
attributable to Taxes, the amount of such Claim shall be determined by reference
to the aggregate Losses attributable to any particular Return and not to any
particular item of such Return.

          (d)  Trigger Amount. Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer for
indemnification of any Losses under this Article 10 until the aggregate amount
of all Losses of to be indemnified by Sellers exceeds Three Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($300,000) (the "Trigger Amount"); in which event Sellers'
indemnification obligation shall apply to the aggregate amount of all claims
with respect to which Buyer is entitled to indemnification hereunder in excess
of the Trigger Amount; provided, however, that such Trigger Amount shall not
apply in the case of any Claim for Losses attributable to (i) Taxes, (ii) any
breach of, or misrepresentation contained in, the representations and warranties
in each of Sections 2.3, 2.8, 3.4, 3.28 and 3.33 and (iii) the matters covered
by each of Section 10.2(b)(iv).

          (e)  Liability Among Sellers. Each Seller hereby agrees with the other
Sellers that it, he or she, as the case may be, shall indemnify and hold
harmless the other Sellers, and their respective heirs, successors,
representatives and assigns, from and against its, his or her Proportionate
Share of any and all Losses under this Article 10, and that the other Sellers
and their respective heirs, successors, representatives and assigns, shall be
entitled to contribution from such indemnifying Seller for its, his, or her
Proportionate Share of any Losses for which they are liable under Article 10, if
the indemnification provided for in this Section 10.4(e) is unavailable for any
reason. "Proportionate Share" shall mean a Seller's proportionate interest in
Target based on the number of shares held by such indemnifying Seller
immediately preceding the Closing Date and the total number of shares issued and
outstanding at such time, expressed as a percentage.

     10.5  Notice and Opportunity to Defend.

          (a)  Each Person seeking indemnification under this Article 10 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify in writing (a "Notice of Claim") the
party obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") of any
Claim as to which indemnity may be sought, which Notice of Claim may be
delivered to the Seller Representative if any Seller is the Indemnifying Party
and which Notice of Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the nature
of the Claim and the basis for the Indemnified Party's request for
indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) the total amount of the actual
out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or
expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith),
and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any
insurance policy and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered
under such

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

insurance policy. The Indemnified Party's failure to give prompt Notice of Claim
or to provide copies of documents or to furnish relevant data, shall not
constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any claim by the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party for Indemnification, except and only to the
extent that such failure shall have caused or increased such liability or
adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or
reduce its liability.

          (b)  Subject to Section 10.5(c) below, if any Notice of Claim relates
to any Claim made against an Indemnified Party by an unrelated third Person,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement relating to Taxes, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its election and at its own expense,
by written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the entire control of,
subject to the right of the Indemnified Party to participate (at its expense and
with counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the
Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, including the selection
of counsel; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
control of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such Claim if (i) the
named parties to such Claim, including any impleaded parties, include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (or, if the Indemnified Party is
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates, any Target Company) and representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them, in which case, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend such Claim and to employ such counsel as
determined by the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, or
(ii) if the amount of the damages reasonably sought by the claimant in any claim
exceeds the remaining indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party by
more that Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and such Claim is subject to the
limitations set forth in Sections 10.4(a) or 10.4(b).

          (c)  If the Indemnifying Party is permitted and elects to assume the
defense of a Claim made by an unrelated third Person:

               (i)  the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all respects
with the Indemnifying Party in any such defense, compromise or settlement
thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent
information and documents under the control of the Indemnified Party; and

               (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently and in good faith
defend such claim and shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
the status of such defense; provided, however, that in the case of any
settlement of any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
approve the settlement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          (d)  If the Indemnifying Party does not so elect to defend any Claim
or shall fail to defend any claim diligently and in good faith (after having so
elected), the Indemnified Party may assume the defense of such Claim and take
such other action as it may elect to defend or settle such Claim as it may
determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

          (e)  If the Notice of Claim does not relate to any Claim made against
an Indemnified Party by an unrelated third Person and the Indemnifying Party
disagrees with the claim specified in the Notice of Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall give the Indemnified Party written notice of all items with which it
disagrees within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of the Notice of Claim (the "Indemnity Dispute Notice"). The Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall then negotiate in good faith for a period of
thirty (30) days following receipt of the Indemnity Dispute Notice to resolve
the disagreements. If after such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party still disagree, then the dispute may be resolved by a
proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 11.5.
If the Indemnifying Party does not provide the Indemnity Dispute Notice to the
Indemnified Party within the fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of the
Notice of Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the full amount
set forth in the Notice of Claim.

          (f)  If Buyer believes it will ultimately be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(v) and Buyer desires to settle the
matter, Buyer shall provide the Indemnifying Party with a Notice of Claim and
Buyer may settle the matter only with the consent of the Indemnifying Party.

     10.6 Reimbursement.

          (a)  Unless an Indemnity Dispute Notice is delivered to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 10.5(e), the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly pay to the Indemnified Party the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss
(or the undisputed portion thereof if the Indemnity Dispute Notice only disputes
a portion of the Claim), at the time that the Indemnified Party shall suffer a
loss because of a breach of, or misrepresentation contained in, any
representation, warranty or covenant by the Indemnifying Party or at the time
the amount of any liability on the part of the Indemnifying Party under this
Article 10 is determined, which in the case of payment to third Persons shall be
the earlier of (i) the date of such payments or (ii) the date that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall enter a final judgment, order or decree (after
exhaustion of appeal rights) establishing such liability (such loss or amount
being hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnifiable Loss"); provided, however,
that with respect to any Losses arising out of a breach of, or misrepresentation
contained in, any representation, warranty or covenant by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the
Notice of Claim to cure such breach or misrepresentation, if such breach or
misrepresentation can be cured, and the payment for the Indemnifiable Loss shall
be due after such thirty (30) day period only if the Indemnifying Party fails to
completely cure such breach or misrepresentation to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Indemnified Party. If any Seller is the Indemnifying Party, Buyer shall
first seek recovery from the Indemnification Escrow in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement before seeking to recover
from any Seller. If the Indemnifiable Loss is not paid as provided in the
immediately foregoing sentence, the Indemnified Party may, at its option, take
legal action against the Indemnifying Party for reimbursement in the amount of
its Indemnifiable Loss. For purposes hereof, the Indemnifiable Loss shall
include the amounts so paid, or determined to be owing, by the Indemnified Party
together with costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and interest on the foregoing
items at the annual rate of ten percent (10%) from the date of notice that the

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

Indemnifiable Loss is due from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
as provided above, until the Indemnifiable Loss shall be paid. If such
Indemnified Party does not prevail in its enforcement action hereunder, it shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Party's costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
interest on the foregoing items at the annual rate of ten percent (10%) from the
date such costs and fees were paid by the Indemnifying Party.

          (b)  Subject to the Indemnified Party's right to object to a Notice of
Claim within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Notice of Claim, in
addition to its other obligations under this Section 10.6, the Indemnifying
Party agrees, as an interim measure during the pendency of any Claim made
against an Indemnified Party by an unrelated third Person for which
indemnification is required pursuant to this Article 10, to reimburse the
Indemnified Party on a monthly basis for all out-of-pocket legal fees or other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any such Claim, notwithstanding the absence of a determination by any arbitrator
or court as to the propriety and enforceability of the Indemnifying Party's
obligation to indemnify the Indemnifying Party for such expenses and the
possibility that such payments might later be held to have been improper by a
court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent that any such interim
reimbursement payment is so held to have been improper, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly return it to the Indemnifying Party, together with interest at
the annual rate of ten percent (10%). Any such interim reimbursement payments
which are not made to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of a request
for reimbursement and which are later held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be amounts that should have been paid by the Indemnified Party shall bear
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of such
request.

     10.7 Adjustments to Indemnification Payments.

          (a)  The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss shall be reduced
(retroactively or prospectively) by any proceeds from insurance policies or
other amounts actually recovered from third parties by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of the related Loss, less any costs, expenses or
premiums incurred (to the extent the Indemnified Party can establish that
premium increases resulted from such Indemnified Loss) by the Indemnified Party
in connection with such recovery. The existence of a Claim by an Indemnified
Party for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss
shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions
contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying
Party. Rather, the Indemnifying Party shall make payment in full of the amount
determined to be due and owing by it against an assignment by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party of the entire claim of the Indemnified Party for
proceeds from insurance policies or against such third party. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that
no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would
not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification
provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which
it is obligated. If an Indemnified Party has received the payment required by
this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss and later
receives proceeds from insurance policies or other amounts in respect of such
Loss, then such Indemnified Party shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in
trust for the benefit of the Indemnifying Party (or Indemnifying Parties) and
shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a
sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the
aggregate amount of any payments

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

received from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in respect of
such Loss (or, if there is more than one Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall pay each Indemnifying Party, its proportionate share (based on
payments received from the Indemnifying Parties) of such Insurance Proceeds).

           (b) If an Indemnified Loss relates to Taxes resulting from the
inclusion of income or disallowance of deductions in a period ending prior to or
on the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, and all or
a portion of such income or deduction is excluded or allowed, respectively, in
another period ending prior to or on the Closing Date, the amount of the
Indemnified Loss shall be limited to the net Tax increase for such periods
ending prior to or on the Closing Date and the net amount of interest and
penalties incurred with respect thereto; provided, however, that any such
Indemnifiable Loss shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any
refund of Taxes of a Target Company that is received by the Indemnified Party
hereunder and that relates to any taxable period ending prior to or on the
Closing Date.

     10.8  No Other Representations, Etc.; No Rescission. Except as set forth in
this Agreement, no party makes any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement with respect to the matters contained herein. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of any party contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part
of any party, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     10.9  Sole and Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided under this
Article 10 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller
subsequent to the Closing for any Losses sustained by Buyer or Seller as a
result of any breach of this Agreement other than losses or liabilities based
upon fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

     10.10 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. The indemnification and
other obligations of Seller and Buyer under this Article 10 shall survive for
the same period of time set forth in Section 10.1, and shall terminate with the
expiration of such survival period, except that any Claims set forth in a Notice
of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such period shall survive until final
resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
no claim for indemnification under this Article 10 shall be brought after the
end of the applicable period set forth in Section 10.1.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
except that Buyer is entitled to assign all or part of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer, provided, however,
that Buyer shall remain fully responsible for the performance of its obligations
hereunder.

     11.3   Construction. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The parties intend
that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant. All
pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter,
singular or plural, as the identity of the Person or Persons may require. All
references herein to Articles, Sections (other than Sections of the Code or any
other statute) and subsections shall be deemed to be references to Articles,
Sections and subsections of this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise
require.

     11.4   Governing Law. With respect to corporate governance matters
concerning a corporation of any jurisdiction, this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction. With respect
to all other matters, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of law provisions thereof.

     11.5   Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties hereby agree that any action,
proceeding or claim against it arising out of, or relating in any way to, this
Agreement may be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or
of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and
irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction for such purpose. The Parties hereby
irrevocably waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction or inconvenient
forum. Any such process or summons to be served upon any of the Parties (at the
option of the party bringing such action, proceeding or claim) may be served by
transmitting a copy thereof, by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, addressed to it at the address set forth in Section
11.1 hereof. Such mailing shall be deemed personal service and shall be legal
and binding upon the Party so served in any action, proceeding or claim.

     11.6   Headings. The headings preceding the text of the sections and
subsections hereof are inserted solely for convenience of reference and shall
not constitute a part of this Agreement, nor shall they affect its meaning,
construction, or effect.

     11.7   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     11.8   Further Assurances. Both before and after Closing hereunder, each
party shall cooperate and take such action as may be reasonably requested by
another party in order to more

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

fully carry out the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     11.9   Course of Dealing. No course of dealing and no delay on the part of
any party hereto in exercising any right, power, or remedy conferred by this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such party's
rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the parties to this Agreement
to require the performance of a term or obligation under this Agreement or the
waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not
prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver
of a subsequent breach hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any rights,
powers or remedies conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

     11.10  Severability. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term or
provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of
this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be valid and enforceable, so as to effect the original intent
of the parties to the greatest extent possible.

     11.11  Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Schedules, Exhibits and
Certificates hereto, each of which is hereby incorporated herein, set forth all
of the promises, covenants, agreements, conditions, and undertakings between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, inducements, or conditions,
express or implied, oral or written. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by the party sought to be charged with effect of
such amendment.

     11.12  Payment. All amounts required to be paid to a party under this
Agreement shall be paid in United States dollars. In the event that any payment
under this Agreement is subject to withholding tax, the payor shall withhold
such Tax and pay such Tax over to the appropriate Taxing Authority and shall pay
the payee such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount
received by the payee after deduction of withholding Tax with respect to such
payment and with respect to such additional amounts is equal to the amount that
would have been received if no such withholding had been made.

     11.13  No Public Disclosure. Except as may be required by law, no party to
this Agreement may disclose the existence or the terms and conditions of this
Agreement without the consent of the Seller Representative and Buyer.

                                      -47-

VALASSIS PURCHASES NCH MARKETING SERVICES

Enhances Marketing Capabilities and Builds International Presence

Livonia, MI, February 13, 2003: Valassis, (NYSE: VCI) the leading company in
marketing solutions and connective media, announced today its acquisition of
Deerfield, Illinois-based NCH Marketing Services, Inc. NCH is the premier coupon
processing and promotion information management company in the United States and
worldwide. Valassis acquired NCH for $60 million, paid for out of existing cash
which totaled $97.2 million on December 31, 2002. Management believes this
accretive transaction will have a positive impact on 2003 earnings per share
(EPS) of approximately $.07 for the 10.5 months of consolidation, which will
change the previous 2003 EPS guidance from down 8% to 18% versus 2002 to down 5%
to 15%.

"The acquisition of NCH complements Valassis' vision of being an innovative,
integrated marketing solutions company," said Alan F. Schultz, Chairman,
President and CEO of Valassis. "NCH and Valassis share similar cultures and
values. We both strive to continually improve the promotional performance of our
customers through consultative selling, data analysis and the increased use of
technology."

The acquisition also provides Valassis with a strong international
infrastructure and 30 years of NCH international experience. "As a result of
being on the Valassis Board of Directors since 1998, I am very familiar with
Valassis' portfolio of products and services and feel they have substantial
potential internationally," said Brian J. Husselbee, President and CEO of NCH.
"The combination of our industry knowledge, resources and relationships with
manufacturers and retailers will stimulate our growth worldwide." Husselbee and
the NCH management team will remain in their current roles at NCH. Wan Ling
Martello, Chief Operating Officer and CFO of NCH, and Husselbee will be present
on the Valassis Fourth Quarter Earnings Call on February 20th.

Under the terms of the transaction, Valassis purchased the privately held shares
of NCH. A private equity firm held approximately 90% of the equity of NCH with
the remaining shares held by management and other minority shareholders. NCH is
expected to generate approximately $60 million in prorated revenue in 2003,
changing the company's previous 2003 revenue guidance from being down mid-single
digits to up slightly. "Based on our growth strategy and analysis, we believe
this acquisition is a good use of cash," said Robert L. Recchia, Executive Vice
President and CFO of Valassis. "It will have an immediate positive impact on EPS
and operating cash flow, while positioning us for future expansion of our
products and services worldwide."
