       Section 2.03. Principal Repayment of Loans. (a) Each Loan shall mature
and be payable in full on the Termination Date.

       (b) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in any Security
Document, the Administrative Agent shall, not later than as of 2:00 p.m. on each
Business Day when any Loans shall be outstanding, (i) debit the Collateral
Account in an amount equal to the balance of the Collateral Account after giving
effect to all Available Funds deposited to the Collateral Account on such day
(including all moneys remitted to the Administrative Agent by account debtors or
by financial institutions at which Controlled Accounts are maintained) and prior
to giving effect to any other transfers from the Collateral Account and (ii)
apply the amount so debited to repay first, the outstanding principal amount of
all of Base Rate Loans and second, the outstanding principal amount of all
Eurodollar Loans; provided that, except upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, no payment of a Eurodollar Loan shall be
made under this Section 2.03(b) on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period or the Termination Date. To the extent that the amount debited in
accordance with the preceding sentence exceeds the outstanding principal amount
of Loans repaid in accordance with the preceding sentence, thereby creating a
credit balance, such credit balance shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the greater of (x) zero percent (0%) and (y) the Prime Rate minus 3%
(which shall be credited against Total Exposure of the Company); provided that
the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company, invest such
credit balance in Liquid Investments held with the Administrative Agent as long
as (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) there shall be no
Loans outstanding hereunder, and (iii) the Phase II Effective Date shall have
occurred. In order to access such credit balance, the Company shall give the
Administrative Agent notice in accordance with the Administrative Agent's
customary operating procedures.

Prepayment and Cover

            (i)   Borrowing Base and Working Capital Commitment Amount. The
       Company shall prepay the Loans (or provide cover for Letter of Credit
       Liabilities as provided below) in such amounts as shall be necessary so
       that Total Exposure (determined without giving effect to outstanding
       Permissible Overadvances made in accordance with Section 2.01(d)) shall
       be less than or equal to Maximum Facility Availability.

            (ii)  Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation Awards. Promptly following
       the receipt thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
       Company shall deposit into an account (the "Insurance Proceeds Account")
       with the Administrative Agent an amount of cash or Liquid Investments
       equal to the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of any payment made to the
       Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) under any Property Insurance
       Policy or (ii) pursuant to any condemnation award. With respect to any
       such payment or award, so long as no Default has occurred and is
       continuing, the aggregate amount of such Net Cash Proceeds which the
       Company or such Subsidiary has expended or committed to expend for the
       restoration or replacement of the asset in respect of which such payment
       or award was made shall be released by the Administrative Agent to the
       Company upon request (specifying in reasonable detail the use of the
       released funds) to pay for such restoration or replacement; provided that
       in the event that within 270 days of receipt of such payment the Company
       or such Subsidiary shall not have expended or committed to expend an
       equivalent amount for the restoration or replacement of the asset in
       respect of which such payment was made, the excess of the amount of such
       payment over the amount of such expenditures and commitments shall be
       transferred from the Insurance Proceeds Account to the Collateral Account
       and applied to prepay the Loans (or provide cover for Letter of Credit
       Liabilities as provided below) on such 270th day.

            (iii) Incurrence of Indebtedness. The Company shall prepay the Loans
       (or provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities as provided below) in
       the amount of and on the date of each receipt by the Company or any of
       its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from the incurrence of any Funded
       Indebtedness not otherwise permitted under Section 7.08 to which the
       Majority Lenders have consented.

            (iv)  Asset Dispositions. The Company shall prepay the Loans (or
       provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities as provided below) in the
       amount of and on the date of each receipt by the Company or any of its
       Subsidiaries of the Net Cash Proceeds of any disposition by such Person
       of

                                       28

<PAGE>

       any assets not otherwise permitted under Section 7.10 to which the
       Majority Lenders have consented.

            (v) Reversion of Pension Plans. The Company shall prepay the Loans
       (or provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities as provided below) in
       the amount of and on the date of each receipt by the Company or any of
       its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from the termination of a Plan.

       (b) Prepayment and Cover of Obligations. In the event of any mandatory
prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.04, such prepayment shall be applied,
first to the payment of accrued interest in respect of outstanding Base Rate
Loans, second to the principal amount of outstanding Base Rate Loans, third to
accrued interest in respect of outstanding Eurodollar Loans, fourth to the
principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Loans, fifth to provide cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities as provided in the immediately following sentence
and sixth to all other outstanding Obligations; provided that except upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no payment of a
Eurodollar Loan shall be made under this Section 2.04 on a date other than the
last day of the applicable Interest Period or the Termination Date. Cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities shall be effected by paying all Reimbursement
Obligations then due and payable and then paying to the Administrative Agent
immediately available funds, to be held by the Administrative Agent in the
Collateral Account maintained by the Company pursuant to the Security Documents,
in an amount equal to the required prepayment, which amount shall be retained by
the Administrative Agent in such Collateral Account and applied to pay any
Reimbursement Obligations which become due until such time as the Letters of
Credit shall have been terminated and all of the Letter of Credit Liabilities
paid in full. The Working Capital Commitments shall be automatically and
permanently reduced as a result of any mandatory prepayment made pursuant to
Section 2.04(a)(ii), 2.04(a)(iii), 2.04(a)(iv) or 2.04(a)(v).

       (c) Prepayment Penalties. The Company shall not be required to pay any
prepayment premiums or penalties in connection with any mandatory prepayments
pursuant to this Section 2.04, other than payments required to be paid pursuant
to Section 4.05 in connection with any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans.

       Section 2.05. Interest. (a) Interest shall accrue on the outstanding and
unpaid principal amount of each Loan for the period from and including the date
of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan is repaid, at the following
rates per year: (i) for a Loan which is a Base Rate Loan, at a variable rate per
annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) for a Loan
which is a Eurodollar Loan, at a fixed rate during the applicable Interest
Period equal to the corresponding Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin;
provided that, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, and following a

                                       29

<PAGE>

written demand of the Administrative Agent to the Company at the request of the
Majority Lenders, interest shall accrue on all Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder (including, to the extent permitted by law, interest on
overdue interest) at the Post-Default Rate.

       (b) Interest on each Loan shall be calculated on the basis of a year of
360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.

       (c) Subject to paragraph (f) below, accrued interest on each Base Rate
Loan shall be due and payable to the Administrative Agent for account of each
Lender in arrears on the first Business Day of each calendar month, regardless
of any payment of the principal thereof.

       (d) Subject to paragraph (f) below, accrued interest on each Eurodollar
Loan shall be due and payable to the Administrative Agent for account of each
Lender in arrears upon any payment of principal and on the last day of each
Interest Period applicable to such Loan.

       (e) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Base Rate, the
Eurodollar Rate and the Eurodollar Base Rate; and such determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Promptly after the determination of any
interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders thereof.

       (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) interest accrued pursuant to the
proviso to paragraph (a) above shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of
any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal
amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior
to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

       (g) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05, if
at any time the rate of interest set forth above on any Loan of or other
obligation payable to any Lender (the "Stated Rate") exceeds the maximum
non-usurious interest rate permissible for such Lender to charge commercial
borrowers under applicable law (the "Maximum Rate" for such Lender), the rate of
interest charged on such Loan of or other obligation payable to such Lender
hereunder shall be limited to the Maximum Rate for such Lender.

           (ii) If the Stated Rate for any Loan of a Lender that has
       theretofore been subject to the preceding paragraph at any time is less
       than the Maximum Rate for such Lender, the principal amount of such Loan
       shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate for such Lender until the total
       amount of interest paid to such Lender or accrued on its Loans hereunder

                                       30

<PAGE>

       equals the amount of interest which would have been paid to such Lender
       or accrued on such Lender's Loans hereunder if the Stated Rate had at all
       times been in effect.

                 (iii) If, upon payment in full of all amounts payable
       hereunder, the total amount of interest paid to any Lender or accrued on
       such Lender's Loans under the terms of this Agreement is less than the
       total amount of interest which would have been paid to such Lender or
       accrued on such Lender's Loans if the Stated Rate had, at all times, been
       in effect, then the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
       law, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender an
       amount equal to the difference between (a) the lesser of (i) the amount
       of interest which would have accrued on such Lender's Loans if the
       Maximum Rate for such Lender had at all times been in effect or (ii) the
       amount of interest which would have accrued on such Lender's Loans if the
       Stated Rate had at all times been in effect and (b) the amount of
       interest actually paid to such Lender or accrued on its Loans under this
       Agreement.

                 (iv)  If any Lender ever receives, collects or applies as
       interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate for such Lender, such
       excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance
       of its Loans or to other amounts (other than interest) payable hereunder,
       and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof
       remaining shall be paid to the Company.

       Section 2.06. Interest Periods. In the case of each Eurodollar Loan, the
Company shall select an Interest Period of any duration in accordance with the
definition of Interest Period in Section 1.01, subject to the following
limitations: (a) no Interest Period shall have a duration of less than one
month, and if any such proposed Interest Period would otherwise be for a shorter
period (as a result of the Termination Date or otherwise), such Interest Period
shall not be available; (b) there may be no more than six Loan Tranches
comprising Eurodollar Loans outstanding at any one time, and (c) if an Interest
Period would end on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period
shall be extended to the next Businesses Day, unless such next Business Day
would fall in the next calendar month, in which event such Interest Period shall
end on the immediately preceding Business Day. All elections of an Interest
Period shall be made by the Company upon three Business Days notice to the
Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.11, and the Administrative
Agent shall quote to the Company the actual Eurodollar Rate to take effect for
such Interest Period (based upon the rate quotation described in the definition
of Eurodollar Rate) on the next Business Day.

         Section 2.07. Conversions. The Company shall have the right to convert
a Loan from a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan or from a Eurodollar Loan to

                                       31

<PAGE>

a Base Rate Loan, at any time or from time to time, provided that: (a) if the
Loan is outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan, it may be converted only on the last
day of the applicable Interest Period; (b) no Loan Tranche comprising a
Eurodollar Loan may be in a principal amount less than $500,000; and (c) there
may be no more than six Loan Tranches comprising Eurodollar Loans outstanding at
any one time; (d) if the Loan is outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan, it shall
automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, unless the Company gives notice to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Section 2.11 three Business Days prior to the last day of the
corresponding Interest Period specifying a new Interest Period to apply to such
Loan; and (e) no Loan Tranche comprising a Eurodollar Loan may be created (or
continued after the last day of the applicable Interest Period) while any
Default exists and continues.

         Section 2.08. Voluntary Prepayments. In addition to repayments made
pursuant to Section 2.03(b), the Company shall have the right to prepay Loans at
any time or from time to time; provided that (i) the Company shall give the
Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment as provided in Section 2.11;
(ii) no Loan Tranche comprising a Eurodollar Loan may be in a principal amount
less than $500,000; and (iii) the Company shall be responsible for the payment
of amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 4.05 in connection with the
prepayment of any Eurodollar Loans prepaid on any date other than the last day
of the corresponding Interest Period.

         Section 2.09. Uncollected Funds Compensation. Any credit extended by
the Administrative Agent to the Company by allowing the Uncollected Funds in the
Collateral Account maintained by the Company at the Administrative Agent to be
immediately available funds to the Company shall not be deemed to be Loans
hereunder. Uncollected Funds Compensation to the Administrative Agent shall
accrue on the amount of the Uncollected Funds in existence from time to time at
a variable rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for
Base Rate Loans for two full days. Upon making such computation, the
Administrative Agent is authorized to make a Loan to the Company for the amount
thereof (or during the continuance of an Event of Default, debit the Collateral
Account) for the payment thereof to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Company of the amount of the Uncollected Funds
Compensation for the preceding calendar month in the next monthly statement
rendered by the Administrative Agent to the Company.

         Section 2.10. Termination or Reduction of Working Capital Commitments.
(a) The Working Capital Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date.

         (b) The Working Capital Commitments shall be reduced in accordance with
Section 2.04(b).

                                       32

<PAGE>

       (c) The Company shall have the right to terminate or permanently reduce
the amount of Working Capital Commitments in whole or in part at any time, to an
amount (which may be zero) not less than the aggregate Working Capital
Outstandings then outstanding; provided that (a) the Company shall give notice
of such termination or reduction to the Administrative Agent as provided in
Section 2.11, (b) each reduction of the Working Capital Commitments shall be in
an amount that is at least equal to $1,000,000 or any greater multiple of
$1,000,000 and (c) any amount required to be paid under Section 2.15(c) shall
have been paid. Any portion of the Working Capital Commitments that has been
terminated may not be reinstated.

       Section 2.11. Certain Notices. Notices by the Company to the
Administrative Agent of borrowings (other than pursuant to Section 2.02(b)),
notice of conversion of any Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans pursuant to
Section 2.07, and notice of each prepayment of a Loan pursuant to Section 2.08
(which does not include repayments pursuant to Section 2.03(b)) or of
termination or reduction of the Working Capital Commitments pursuant to Section
2.10 shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the
Administrative Agent in writing on a Business Day and (a) in the case of Base
Rate Loans and prepayments of Base Rate Loans, given not later than 11:00 a.m.
on the date of such Base Rate Loan or such prepayment; (b) in the case of
Eurodollar Loans and prepayments of Eurodollar Loans, given not later than 11:00
a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of such Eurodollar Loan or such
prepayment and (c) in the case of termination or reduction of the Working
Capital Commitments, given not later than 12:00 noon four Business Days prior
thereto. Each such notice of borrowing or prepayment shall specify the amount of
the Loans to be borrowed or prepaid and the date of borrowing or prepayment
(which shall be a Business Day). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
the Lenders of the contents of each such notice.

       Section 2.12. Calculation of Borrowing Base. The Administrative Agent
shall calculate from time to time the amount of the Borrowing Base, based upon
the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate as updated by the most recent Weekly
Collateral Certificate and any other relevant information, and such amount shall
be the "Borrowing Base" hereunder; provided that the Administrative Agent, in
its reasonable credit judgment, may establish additional reserves against the
Borrowing Base, taking into account, among other things, but without limitation
in any way, increases in receivables dilution as shown in periodic field
examinations.

       Section 2.13. Letters of Credit. (a) On the Phase I Effective Date,
without further action by any party hereto, JPMorgan Chase shall be deemed to
have granted to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed to have acquired
from JPMorgan Chase, a participation in each Existing Letter of Credit and the

                                       33

<PAGE>

related Letter of Credit Liabilities equal to such Lender's Working Capital
Commitment Percentage thereof.

       (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may
request the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Company, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and JPMorgan Chase, by
delivering to the Administrative Agent and JPMorgan Chase by electronic or
facsimile transmission (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension) a letter of credit application in the form
required by the Administrative Agent and JPMorgan Chase. A Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, the Company shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate Letter of Credit Liabilities
shall not exceed $7,000,000, (ii) Total Exposure (determined without giving
effect to outstanding Permissible Overadvances made in accordance with Section
2.01(d)) shall not exceed Maximum Facility Availability and (iii) Total Exposure
(including all Permissible Overadvances) shall not exceed the aggregate amount
of Working Capital Commitments.

       (c) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of
business on the earlier of (i) the date 364 days after the date of the issuance
of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit, 364 days after such renewal or extension), and (ii) the date
that is thirty Business Days prior to the Termination Date. No Letter of Credit
may be extended beyond the date that is thirty Business Days prior to the
Termination Date.

       (d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of
Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part
of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, JPMorgan Chase hereby grants to each
Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from JPMorgan Chase, a participation in
such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Working Capital Commitment
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the aggregate Working Capital Commitments. If JPMorgan Chase
shall make any disbursement in respect of any Letter of Credit, the resulting
Reimbursement Obligation created thereby shall be deemed to be a Loan from each
of the Lenders in accordance with each Lender's Working Capital Commitment
Percentage. JPMorgan Chase shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
of the creation of any Reimbursement Obligation within two Business Days of any
disbursement made by JPMorgan Chase pursuant to or under any Letter of Credit.

                                       34

<PAGE>

       (e) The Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit shall
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in
any respect, (iii) payment by JPMorgan Chase to the beneficiary under a Letter
of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) the existence of
any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the Company or any other Person
may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the
Administrative Agent, or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, any other Financing Document or otherwise, and (v) any
other event or circumstance whatsoever (other than gross negligence or willful
misconduct of JPMorgan Chase), whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.13, constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of the Company's' obligations hereunder.

       (f) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions herein above set forth, any action taken or omitted by JPMorgan Chase
under or in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or any related
certificates shall not, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, put JPMorgan Chase under any resulting liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or relieve the Company of any of its obligations
hereunder to JPMorgan Chase or the Lenders.

       (g) The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender and the
Administrative Agent (which for purposes of this Section 2.13(g) shall include a
reference to JPMorgan Chase acting in its individual capacity hereunder as
issuer of Letters of Credit) from and against any and all claims and damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender or the Administrative
Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender or the
Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection
with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay
under any Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the Administrative Agent may incur
by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or
comply with its obligations to the Administrative Agent hereunder (but nothing
herein contained shall affect any rights the Company may have against such
defaulting Lender); provided that the Company shall not be required to indemnify
any Lender or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by
(i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent in

                                       35

<PAGE>

determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with
the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Lender's failure to pay under
any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. Nothing in this
Section 2.13(g) is intended to limit the obligations of the Company under any
other provision of this Agreement.

     Section 2.14. Settlement Between Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall settle on an aggregated and netted
basis (the "Settlement Amount") on a weekly basis or with such greater frequency
as the Administrative Agent may determine (each such date on which such a
settlement occurs being a "Settlement Date") for all amounts which shall have
become due to and due from the Administrative Agent and the Lenders since the
immediately preceding Settlement Date with respect to any Obligations, other
than the Settlement Amount which became due on the immediately preceding
Settlement Date. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders by 11:00 a.m.
on each Settlement Date of the Settlement Amount which is payable by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders, as the case may be, shall make payment of the Settlement Amount by an
electronic funds transfer not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date.
Nothing in this Section 2.14 or the settlement procedures made pursuant to this
Section 2.14 shall be deemed to change, as between the Company and the Lenders,
the amount of the Loans which are outstanding or the accrual of interest due to
each of the Lenders on such Loans.

     Section 2.15. Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent quarterly through the Termination Date and on the Termination Date for the
account of each of the Lenders a commitment fee which shall accrue on the daily
average unused amount of such Lender's Working Capital Commitments for the
period from and including the Phase I Effective Date through the Termination
Date. The commitment fee shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for
the actual number of days elapsed at a rate per year equal to the applicable
Commitment Fee Rate. The commitment fee shall be due and payable in arrears
quarterly on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter and shall be
computed by Administrative Agent. On each such payment date, the Administrative
Agent is authorized to make a Loan to the Company for the amount thereof (or
during the continuance of an Event of Default, debit the Collateral Account) for
the payment thereof to the Lenders.

       (b) The Company agrees to pay, with respect to Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, the following quarterly fees: (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders (according to each Lender's Working Capital Commitment
Percentage), a letter of credit fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued
hereunder which accrues at a rate equal to (x) the daily aggregate amount
available for drawing under such Letter of Credit multiplied by (y) the
Applicable

                                       36

<PAGE>

Margin, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for actual
number of days elapsed and paid by the Company quarterly in advance on the first
Business Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) JPMorgan Chase for its own account,
a letter of credit fronting fee payable in respect of each Letter of Credit
issued hereunder which accrues at a rate equal to (x) the face amount of such
Letter of Credit multiplied by (y) 0.125% per annum, such fees to be calculated
on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed and paid by
the Company quarterly in advance on the first Business Day of each calendar
quarter and (iii) to JPMorgan Chase for its own account, customary processing
fees and expenses charged by JPMorgan Chase for issuing, amending, modifying or
extending any Letter of Credit. Upon making a computation of the amount of any
Letter of Credit fee, the Administrative Agent is authorized to make a Loan to
the Company for the amount thereof.

     (c) In the event that the Working Capital Commitments are terminated or
reduced by the Company prior to the first anniversary of the Phase I Effective
Date pursuant to Section 2.10(c), the Company shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each of the Lenders an early termination fee in an
amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate amount so terminated or reduced; provided
that no such prepayment fee shall be payable under this paragraph (c) if the
Working Capital Commitments are terminated in connection with a refinancing of
the Loans by the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates.

     (d) The Company agrees to pay the Administrative Agent (for its own
account) such fees payable in such amounts and at the times separately agreed to
in writing between the Company and the Administrative Agent.

     Section 2.16. Payments Generally. All payments under this Agreement or the
Notes shall be made in Dollars in funds which are immediately available not
later than 1:00 p.m. on the relevant dates specified herein at 395 North
Services Road, 3rd Floor, Melville, New York 11747-3142 for the account of each
Lender and any payment made after such time on such due date will be deemed to
have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any
payment (other than with respect to the principal of the Loans) under this
Agreement becomes due, the Administrative Agent, at its discretion without the
requirement of obtaining the consent of or giving prior notice to the Company,
may make a Loan to the Company for the amount thereof (or during the continuance
of an Event of Default, debit the Collateral Account for the payment thereof to
the Lenders). The Administrative Agent, or any Lender (subject to Section 3.03)
for whose account any such payment is to be made, may (but shall not be
obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such
time to any ordinary deposit account of the Company with the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any Lender so doing shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent. Subject to Section 3.01, the Company shall, at
the time of making each payment under this Agreement or the

                                       37

<PAGE>

Notes, specify to the Administrative Agent the principal or other amount payable
by the Company under this Agreement or the Notes to which such payment is to be
applied and in the event that it fails to so specify, or if a Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may, subject
to Section 3.01, apply such payment as it may elect in its sole discretion. If
the due date of any payment under this Agreement or the Notes would otherwise
fall on a day which is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for any principal so
extended for the period of such extension. Each payment received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note for the account of a Lender
shall be paid promptly to such Lender, in immediately available funds, for the
account of the Applicable Lending Office.

     Section 2.17. Commitment Increases. (a) At any time and from time to time,
the Company may, if it so elects, increase the amount of the Commitments (in
each case in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000), either by
designating one or more financial institutions not theretofore Lenders to become
Lenders or by agreeing with one or more of the existing Lenders that such
Lenders' Working Capital Commitments shall be increased. Upon execution and
delivery by the Company and such Lenders or other financial institutions of an
instrument (a "Commitment Acceptance") substantially in the form of Exhibit J
hereto, such existing Lenders shall have additional Working Capital Commitments
as therein set forth or such other financial institutions shall become Lenders
with Working Capital Commitments as therein set forth and with all rights and
obligations of Lenders with Working Capital Commitments as therein set forth;
provided that no such increase shall be effective unless (i) the Administrative
Agent shall have consented to the designation of any financial institution not
theretofore a Lender (it being understood that no consent or approval from any
Lender shall be required), (ii) immediately after such increase, the aggregate
Working Capital Commitments shall not exceed $50,000,000, (iii) no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, (iv) in the case of the first such increase,
each Original Lender shall first have been offered an opportunity to provide all
(or its ratable share of) any such increase, and such offer shall have been
declined or deemed declined in accordance with the procedure set forth in the
immediately following sentence and (v) the Phase II Effective Date shall have
occurred. The Company shall, prior to entering into a Commitment Acceptance with
any Lender or other financial institution with respect to the initial increase
of Working Capital Commitments, provide written notice of any proposed increase
to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall constitute an offer to each
Original Lender to provide the requested increase or a portion thereof and shall
specify the amount of the requested increase, the requested effective date of
such increase (the "Increase Date"), and the time period within which each
Original Lender is requested to respond to such offer. Upon receipt of any such
notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Original Lender and
each such Original Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within the
specified period

                                       38

<PAGE>

whether or not it agrees to a Lender hereunder. Any Original Lender not
responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to become a
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of each Lender's or
other institution's response to each offer made hereunder.

     (b) If and to the extent any Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding on
the Increase Date, the Administrative Agent shall reallocate them ratably among
the Lenders after giving effect to such increase (and appropriate payments shall
be made to and from the Lenders) so that each Lender's pro rata share thereof is
based on the increased aggregate Working Capital Commitments then in effect.

     Section 2.18. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used
solely: (i) for general corporate and working capital purposes, (ii) for the
issuance of letters of credit for the benefit of the Company and the Subsidiary
Guarantors, and (iii) to finance up to $10,000,000 of the cost to repurchase the
Covington Assets; provided that on any date on which the proceeds of the Loans
are proposed to be used for such purpose (each a "Test Date"), the Covington
Lease Conditions shall have been satisfied. For the purpose of this Section
2.18, "Covington Lease Conditions" shall mean each of the following conditions,
measured on any Test Date on a pro-forma basis after giving effect to the
funding of any proposed Loans and the application of the proceeds thereof to
finance the repurchase of Covington Assets (and, in the case of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, as if such repurchase had occurred on the first day of the
relevant period): (i) Facility Availability will be at least equal to
$20,000,000, (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended prior to the relevant Test Date
shall exceed 1.01:1 and (iii) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

     Section 2.19. Exchange Rate for Canadian Dollars. For purposes of
determining the value in Dollars of any amounts denominated in Canadian Dollars
(including without limitation, any Receivables of the Company or any Subsidiary
Guarantor which are so denominated) on any date of determination, the rate of
exchange used shall be the rate of exchange publicly announced by the
Administrative Agent for the exchange of Canadian Dollars into United States
Dollars as of the Business Day immediately preceding such date of determination.

             Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Payments, Etc.

     Section 3.1. Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (a) each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.01 hereof shall be
made from the Lenders, each payment of commitment fees, letter of credit fees
and early termination fees under Section 2.15 hereof shall be made for the
account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the Working Capital
Commitments under Section 2.10 hereof shall be applied to the Working Capital

                                       39

<PAGE>

Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the Lenders' respective
Working Capital Commitment Percentages; (b) each payment by the Company of
principal of or interest on Loans of a particular Type (other than payments in
respect of Loans of individual Lenders provided for by Article 4 hereof) shall
be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by
the Lenders; (c) each conversion of Loans of a particular Type (other than
conversions of Loans of individual Lenders pursuant to Section 4.04 hereof)
shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of such Loans held by the Lenders; and (d) the Lenders (other
than JPMorgan Chase) shall purchase from JPMorgan Chase participations in the
Letters of Credit to the extent of their respective Working Capital Commitment
Percentages.

     Section 3.02. Non-receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the Company (the
"Payor") prior to the date on which such Lender is to make payment to the
Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder (or
the payment of any amount by such Lender to reimburse JPMorgan Chase for a
drawing under any Letter of Credit) or the Company is to make a payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of one or more of the Lenders, as the case
may be (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice
shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to
the intended recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment (or,
if such recipient is the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, the Company and, if
the Company fails to pay the amount thereof to the Administrative Agent
forthwith upon demand, the Lenders ratably in proportion to their respective
Working Capital Percentages) shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent
the amount made available to it together with interest thereon in respect of the
period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent receives such
amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such period ;
provided that as used in this Section 3.02, "Required Payment" does not include
any amounts due from a Lender to the Administrative Agent which are to be
settled on the next Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.14, but "Required
Payment" shall include, as of each Settlement Date, any amounts due from a
Lender to the Administrative Agent as part of the Settlement Amount to be paid
on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 2.14.

     Section 3.03. Sharing of Payments, Etc. The Company agrees that, in
addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set-off, bankers' lien or

                                       40

<PAGE>

counterclaim a Lender may otherwise have, each Lender shall be entitled, at its
option, to offset balances held by it for the account of the Company at any of
its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any principal of or
interest on any of such Lender's Loans to the Company hereunder, or any
Reimbursement Obligation or other obligation of the Company hereunder, which is
not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are then due to the
Company), in which case it shall promptly notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent thereof, provided that such Lender's failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity thereof. If a Lender shall obtain payment
of any principal of or interest on any Loan made by it under this Agreement, or
on any Reimbursement Obligation or other obligation then due to such Lender
hereunder, through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien,
counterclaim or similar right, or otherwise, it shall promptly purchase from the
other Lenders participations in the Loans made, or Reimbursement Obligations or
other obligations held, by the other Lenders in such amounts, and make such
other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable to the end that all
the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any expenses which
may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata
in accordance with the unpaid principal and interest on the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations then due to each of them. To such
end all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the
resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored. The Company agrees, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Person purchasing a
participation in the Loans made, or Reimbursement Obligations or other
obligations held, by another Person, whether or not acquired pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements, may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien,
counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were a direct holder of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations or other
obligations in the amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein shall
require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any
Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with
respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Company.

     Section 3.04. Several Obligations. The failure of any Lender to make any
Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other
Lender of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make a Loan to be made by such other Lender.

     Section 3.05. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the
Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed
on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the

                                       41

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Company shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) except as provided in
subsection (h) below, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 3.05), such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.

     (b)    In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp
or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit or any other Basic Document or other document referred to
herein or therein (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (c)    The Company will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including related penalties,
interest and expenses resulting from the Company's failure to pay Taxes or Other
Taxes in accordance with this Section 3.05) imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 3.05 paid by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

     (d)    Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Company
will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section
10.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

     (e)    If any Lender subsequently receives from a taxing authority a refund
of any Tax previously paid by the Company and for which the Company has
indemnified the Lender pursuant to this Section 3.05 or if the Lender takes a
credit for such Tax against taxes otherwise owing by it to the jurisdiction to
which the Company paid the Tax, such Lender shall within 30 days after receipt
of such refund, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay to the
Company the net

                                       42

<PAGE>

amount of any such recovery after deducting taxes and expenses attributable
thereto.

     (f)    Not later than the Closing Date or, in the case of any bank or
financial institution that became or becomes a Lender after the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 10.06, the date of the instrument of assignment pursuant to
which such bank or financial institution became a Lender, and annually
thereafter or at such other times as the Administrative Agent or the Company may
request, each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States has provided or shall provide the Administrative Agent and the
Company with duly completed copies of Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8ECI or any
successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States
certifying as to such Lender's status as exempt from United States withholding
taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder or other
documents satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent indicating
that all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder are not subject to such
taxes (an "Exemption Certificate"). In the case of payments to or for any Lender
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, unless the
Administrative Agent has received an Exemption Certificate from such Lender, the
Administrative Agent may withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable
statutory rate and the Company shall not be liable therefor under this Section
3.05.

     (g)    If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Lender
pursuant to this Section 3.05, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will
thereafter avoid the need for any additional payments under this Section 3.05
and will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous
to such Lender.

     (h)    If a Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States has not delivered an Exemption Certificate to the Company on or
before the Closing Date or, in the case of any bank or financial institution
that became or becomes a Lender after the Closing Date pursuant to Section
10.06, the date of the instrument of assignment pursuant to which such bank or
financial institution became a Lender, then the Company shall not have any
obligation to indemnify such Lender for Taxes (including related penalties,
interest and expenses) imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
thereof pursuant to Section 3.05(a) and 3.05(c) hereof.

                         Yield Protection and Illegality

     Section 4.01. Additional Costs. (a) The Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender from time to time such
amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any
costs incurred by such Lender which such Lender determines are attributable to
its making or maintaining of any Eurodollar Loans hereunder or its obligation to
make any of such Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by
such Lender hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such
increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called
"Additional Costs"), in each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

            (i)    changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such
     Lender under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of such Loans
     (other than changes which affect taxes measured by or imposed on the
     overall net income of such Lender or of its Applicable Lending Office for
     any of such Loans by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its
     principal office or such Applicable Lending Office and other than Taxes and
     Other Taxes); or

            (ii)   imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, insurance
     assessment or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or
     other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender
     (including any of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition
     of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof but excluding, with
     respect to any such Eurodollar Loan, any reserve requirements reflected in
     the applicable Eurodollar Rate); or

            (iii)  imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement (or any
     of such extensions of credit or liabilities).

     Each Lender will notify the Company through the Administrative Agent of any
event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender
to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) as promptly as practicable
after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation,
and (if so requested by the Company through the Administrative Agent) will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Eurodollar Loans of such
Lender if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender (provided that such Lender shall have no
obligation to so designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United
States of America). Each Lender will furnish the Company with a statement
setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for
compensation under this Section 4.01(a). If any Lender requests compensation

                                       44

<PAGE>

from the Company under this Section 4.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such
Lender through the Administrative Agent, suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make additional Eurodollar Loans to the Company until the Regulatory Change
giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions
of Section 4.04 hereof shall be applicable).

     (b)    Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 4.01, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender
either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Lender which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of
extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes Eurodollar
Loans or (ii) becomes subject generally to restrictions on the amount of such a
category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Lender so
elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the
obligation of such Lender to make or continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans
into, Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the date such Lender
withdraws such notice or such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which
case the provisions of Section 4.04 hereof shall be applicable).

     (c)    Determinations and allocations by any Lender for purposes of this
Section 4.01 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of maintaining
its obligations to make Loans or of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts
receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the additional amounts required to
compensate such Lender in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

     Section 4.02. Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, prior to the commencement of any Interest Period with
respect to any Eurodollar Loans:

     (a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive) that adequate and reasonable shall mean do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Base Rate for such Interest Period; or

     (b)    the Majority Lenders determine (which determination shall be
conclusive) and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Base Rate
will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
maintaining such Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each Lender
thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be
under no obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans and the Company shall, on the last day(s) of the then

                                       45

<PAGE>

current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either prepay
such Loans or convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section
2.07 hereof.

         Section 4.03. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender
or its Applicable Lending Office to (a) honor its obligation to make Eurodollar
Loans hereunder, or (b) maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender
shall promptly notify the Company thereof through the Administrative Agent and
such Lender's obligation to make Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended
until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Eurodollar Loans (in
which case the provisions of Section 4.04 hereof shall be applicable).

         Section 4.04. Substitute Base Rate Loans. If the obligation of any
Lender to make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.01,
4.02 or 4.03 hereof, all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender as
Eurodollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (and, if an event
referred to in Section 4.01(b) or 4.03 hereof has occurred and such Lender so
requests by notice to the Company with a copy to the Administrative Agent, each
Eurodollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted
into a Base Rate Loan on the date specified by such Lender in such notice) and,
to the extent that Eurodollar Loans are so made as (or converted into) Base Rate
Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such
Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to such Base Rate Loans.

         Section 4.05. Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through
the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it as a result of:

         (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan made by
such Lender on a date earlier than the last day of an Interest Period for such
Loan; or

         (b) any failure by the Company to borrow a Eurodollar Loan to be made
by such Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice
of borrowing under Section 2.11 hereof;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal
amount so paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed for the period from the
date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure to borrow to the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date
of such failure to

                                       46

<PAGE>

borrow) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
over (ii) the interest component (as reasonably determined by such Lender) of
the amount (as reasonably determined by such Lender) such Lender would have bid
in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts
comparable to such principal amount and maturities comparable to such period.

         Section 4.06. Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. If as a
result of any Regulatory Change there shall be imposed, modified or deemed
applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against or
with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit issued or to be
issued hereunder or participations therein, and the result shall be to increase
the cost to any Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or any
participation therein, or reduce any amount receivable by any Lender hereunder
in respect of any Letter of Credit (which increase in cost, or reduction in
amount receivable, shall be the result of such Lender's reasonable allocation of
the aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then,
upon demand by such Lender, the Company agrees to pay to such Lender, from time
to time as specified by such Lender, such additional amounts as shall be
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in
amount. A statement as to such increased costs or reductions in amount incurred
by such Lender shall be submitted by such Lender to the Company and shall be
conclusive as to the amount thereof absent manifest error.

         Section 4.07. Capital Adequacy. If any Lender shall determine that the
adoption or implementation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or treaty
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender or any
Person controlling such Lender (a "Parent") as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its Parent) could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such reduction. A statement of any Lender claiming compensation under this
Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In determining such amount,
such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

                         Representations and Warranties

         The Company represents and warrants to the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent as follows:

         Section 6.01. Corporate Existence. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries: (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; (b) has all
requisite corporate power, and has all governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary to own its assets and carry on its business as
now being or as proposed to be conducted, except in the case of such licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals, where the failure to obtain them would
not have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) is qualified to do business in all
jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary and where failure so to qualify would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.02. Information. (a) Each of the Offering Materials and the
financial statements referred to in Section 5.01(f) hereof (the "Company
Financials") did not as of the date thereof and will not as of the Phase I
Effective Date contain any untrue statement of a material fact or assumption or
omit to state a material fact or assumption necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading; provided that (i) although the
management of the Company believed as of the Phase I Effective Date that the
projections contained in the Offering Materials are reasonable, the Company
makes no representation as to their attainability, and (ii) it is understood
that the Offering Materials are not intended to, and do not, contain all the
information that would be contained in a prospectus prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


         (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a):

                 (i)   The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company
         and its Subsidiary as of September 30, 2002 and the related
         consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
         flows for the year then ended (the "Company Audited Statements"), have
         been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
         principles as in effect on December 31, 2002 consistently applied. The
         Company Audited Statements fairly present the financial position of the
         Company and its Subsidiary at September 30, 2002 and the results of
         their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity
         with generally accepted accounting principles.

                 (ii)  The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
         Subsidiary as of December 31, 2002 and the related consolidated

                                       52

<PAGE>

         statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
         three months then ended have been prepared in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting principles for interim financial information as in
         effect on January 15, 2003, and fairly present, in all material
         respects, the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiary as
         of December 31, 2002 and the results of their operations and cash flows
         for the three months then ended.

                 (iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries did not on the date of
         the balance sheets referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, and will
         not on the Phase I Effective Date, have any material contingent
         liabilities, material liabilities for taxes, unusual and material
         forward or long-term commitments or material unrealized or anticipated
         losses from any unfavorable commitments, except as referred to or
         reflected or provided for in said balance sheets.

         (c) The Company has disclosed to the Lenders in writing in or pursuant
to this Agreement and in the Offering Materials any and all facts (other than
general economic and industry conditions) which have or pose a material risk of
having a Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Since September 30, 2002 no event has occurred and no condition has
come into existence which has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect, it being understood that the restatement of the Company's
financial statements to the extent referred to in the Company's press release
dated December 20, 2002 shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.03. Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company's press
release dated January 15, 2002, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings or
any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency,
now pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse decision which could have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.04. No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of the
Basic Documents, the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, or
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof did or will conflict with or
result in a breach of, or require any consent under, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
court or governmental authority or agency, or any Basic Document or other
material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or constitute a
default under any such agreement or instrument, or (except for the Liens created
pursuant to the Security Documents) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any of the

                                       53

<PAGE>

revenues or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
terms of any such agreement or instrument.

         Section 6.05. Corporate Action. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under the Basic Documents to which it is a party;
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the Basic Documents to which they are parties have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action; and this Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company and, on the Phase I Effective Date, each of
the other Basic Documents to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party will constitute its legal, valid and binding obligation, in each case
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other
similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general equitable principles.

         Section 6.06. Approvals. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
obtained all authorizations, approvals and consents of, and has made all filings
and registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency and
any third party necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by it of
any Basic Document to which it is a party, or for the validity or enforceability
thereof, except for filings and recordings of the Liens created pursuant to, or
permitted by, the Security Documents.

         Section 6.07. Regulations U and X. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in
the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System) and no part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder
will be used to purchase or carry any such margin stock.

         Section 6.08. ERISA. The Company and each member of the Controlled
Group have fulfilled their obligations under the minimum funding standards of
ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all
material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code
with respect to each Plan. No such Person has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum
funding standard under Section 412 of the Code in respect of any Plan, (ii)
failed to make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan, or
made any amendment to any Plan, which has resulted or could result in the
imposition of a Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or
the Code, or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than a
liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA).

which are required to be filed by it and has paid all taxes due pursuant to such
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by it, except to the extent the
same may be contested as permitted by Section 7.02 hereof. There are no material
tax disputes or contests pending as of the Phase I Effective Date. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the
Company, adequate.

         Section 6.10. Subsidiaries; Agreements. (a) Schedule V hereto is a
complete and correct list, as of the Phase I Effective Date, of all Subsidiaries
of the Company and of all Investments held by the Company or any of its

attach thereto, and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a Lien upon
the property of the Company or such Subsidiary, provided that neither the

<PAGE>

proceedings if (x) it maintains adequate reserves with respect thereto, (y) such

less favorable than set forth in Schedule VIII.

     Such insurance shall be written by financially responsible companies
selected by the Company, having an A.M. Best rating of "A-" or better and in a
financial size category of XV or larger, or by other companies acceptable to the

cancelled or reduced or amended except after not less than 30 days' written
notice to the Administrative Agent and provide that the interests of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be invalidated by any act or
negligence of the Company or any Person having an interest in the Plants nor by
occupancy or use of the Plants for purposes more hazardous than permitted by
such policy nor by any foreclosure or other proceedings relating to the Plants.
The Company will advise the Administrative Agent promptly of any policy
cancellation, reduction or amendment.

     On the Closing Date the Company delivered to the Administrative Agent
certificates of insurance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing
the existence of all insurance required to be maintained by the Company
hereunder and showing the termination or expiry date of such insurance.
Thereafter, not later than five Business Days prior to the termination or expiry
date of any such insurance the Company has delivered and shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent certificates of insurance evidencing that such insurance
has been renewed or replaced, subject only to the payment of premiums as they
become due. The Company shall not obtain or carry separate insurance concurrent
in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required by this Section
unless the

                                       64

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent is named as loss payee and insured therein, with loss
payable as provided herein. The Company will immediately notify the
Administrative Agent whenever any such separate insurance is obtained and shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the certificates evidencing the same.

     If, in the opinion of the Company, any of the insurance which it is
required to maintain pursuant to this Section is not available on commercially
reasonable terms, the Company shall so notify the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and, with the consent of the Majority Lenders, may elect not to purchase
such insurance; provided that if the Company shall not have received notice of

shall prevent the merger and dissolution of any Subsidiary of the Company into
the Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary so long as the Company or such
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary is the surviving corporation.

     Section 7.05. Maintenance of and Access to Properties. The Company will
keep, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep, all of its properties
necessary in its business in good working order and condition (having regard to
the condition of such properties at the time such properties were acquired by
the Company or such Subsidiary), ordinary wear and tear excepted, and proper
books of record and account in which entries shall be made in conformity with
GAAP of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business activities,
and will permit representatives of the Lenders to inspect such properties and,
upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, to examine and make extracts and
copies from the books and records of the Company and any such Subsidiary.

will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, with the requirements of all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental body or
regulatory authority (including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws), a

good faith and by proper proceedings.

collateral securing it, (iii) Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors to the

the United States Copyright Office, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, or any court) regarding the Company's ownership of any Copyright, Patent
or Trademark that is material to the business of the Company or any of its

under the circumstances to protect such Copyright, Copyright License, Patent,
Patent License, Trademark or Trademark License; provided that the Company shall

ascribed to them in the Security Documents.

     (b)   The Majority Lenders shall have the right from time to time to
require the Company, pursuant to a written request from the Administrative

as may be specified in such request to secure the obligations of the Company and
such Subsidiary hereunder and under the Subsidiary Guaranty or such other
guaranties. Any such request shall be made by the Majority Lenders in the good
faith exercise of their discretion. Within 30 days after any such request, the
Company shall, and shall cause such Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent such number of copies as the
Administrative Agent may specify of documents creating such guaranties and Liens
and (ii) do all other things which may be necessary or which the Administrative

Company to, deliver such legal opinions, certificates, evidences of corporate
action or other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request,

books, records, billing and collection processes and management information
systems three times during each fiscal year of the Company and inventory
appraisals annually (or, in each case, with such greater frequency as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably require); provided that the Company will
permit the Examiner to conduct such examinations and appraisal at any time and
from time to time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default.

examination and inventory appraisal at the Examiner's standard per diem rate per
person, plus actual out-of-pocket expenses or, if applicable, for such other
amounts as shall reasonably be charged from time to time by the Examiner for
work of this kind. In connection with such field audits, the Company will permit
the Examiner to make test verifications of the Receivables with the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' customers.

transaction, and (b) direct all financial institutions at which any Controlled
Accounts are maintained to remit to the Administrative Agent on a daily basis
(or at such other frequency as the Administrative Agent, in its discretion shall
specify to the Company), all collected funds in such Controlled Accounts. At all
times from and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to maintain, preserve and protect the rights and interests of the
Administrative Agent with respect to all cash deposits of the Company and all
other proceeds of Collateral and shall not, without the Administrative Agent's
prior written consent, open any new or additional deposit or other bank
accounts.

     Section 7.24. Lockbox Operation. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall at all times direct their account debtors to make all

                            The Administrative Agent

     Section 9.01. Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its agent
hereunder and under the Letters of Credit and the other Basic Documents with
such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this Section
9.01 shall include reference to its affiliates and its and its affiliates'
officers, directors, employees and agents and to JPMorgan Chase acting in its
individual capacity hereunder as issuer of Letters of Credit): (a) shall have no
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the Letters of Credit and the other Basic Documents, and shall not by reason of
this Agreement,

                                       77

<PAGE>

the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document be a trustee for any Lender;
(b) shall not be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, the Letters of Credit
or any other Basic Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement, the
Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document, or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the
Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document or any other document referred to
or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation
or collection proceedings hereunder or under any other Basic Document except to
the extent requested by the Majority Lenders; and (d) shall not be responsible
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under the Letters
of Credit, any other Basic Document or any other document or instrument referred
to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith,
except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for
the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
it with reasonable care. Without in any way limiting any of the foregoing, each
Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agent shall have no greater
responsibility in the operation of Letters of Credit than is specified in the
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision),
International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 (or any replacement or
revision thereof in effect from time to time).

     Section 9.02. Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the
proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Letters of
Credit or any other Basic Document, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Majority Lenders and
such instructions of the Majority Lenders and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

     Section 9.03. Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of
principal of or interest on Loans or Reimbursement Obligations) unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Company specifying
such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event
that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a
Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the


                                       78

<PAGE>

Lenders (and shall give each Lender prompt notice of each such non-payment). The
Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 9.07 hereof) take such action
with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders,
provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

     Section 9.04. Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Working Capital
Commitments and the Loans made and Letter of Credit Liabilities held by it,
JPMorgan Chase in its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent
in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may (without having to
account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Company (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may accept fees and other
consideration from the Company (in addition to the agency fees and arrangement
fees heretofore agreed to between the Company, the Administrative Agent for
services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to
account for the same to the Lenders.

     Section 9.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 2.13(g), 10.03
or 10.04 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of the Company under said
Sections 2.13(g), 10.03 and 10.04 ), ratably in accordance with their respective
Working Capital Commitments, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document or any
other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the
costs and expenses which the Company is obligated to pay under Sections 2.13(g),
10.03 and 10.04 hereof but excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is
continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance
of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

     Section 9.06. Non-reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and

                                       79

information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Company and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any of the other
Basic Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself
informed as to the performance or observance by the Company (other than
maintaining records of payments by the Company to it) or any other Person of
this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or
books of the Company or any other Person. Except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, under the Letters of Credit or the other
Basic Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Company or any
other Person (or any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession of
the Administrative Agent.

     Section 9.07. Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent hereunder, under the Letters of Credit and under the other
Basic Documents, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified
in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive
further assurances to its satisfaction by the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 9.05 hereof against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

     Section 9.08. Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. Subject to
the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided
below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Lenders and the Company and the Administrative Agent may be removed at
any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Administrative Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority
Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent (the "Notice Date"), then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company. Any
successor Administrative Agent shall be (i) a Lender or (ii) if no Lender has
accepted such appointment within 40 days after the Notice Date, a bank which has
an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least
$250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative

                                       80

<PAGE>

Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9.08 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

     Section 9.09. Collateral Sub-Agents. Each Lender by its execution and
delivery of this Agreement agrees, as contemplated by the Security Documents,
that, in the event it shall hold any Liquid Investments referred to therein,
such Liquid Investments shall be held in the name and under the control of such
Lender and such Lender shall hold such Liquid Investments as a collateral
sub-agent for the Administrative Agent thereunder.

                                 Miscellaneous

     Section 10.01. Waiver. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing
with respect to, any right, power or privilege under any Basic Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege thereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies
provided in the Basic Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

     Section 10.02. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
herein (including, without limitation, any modifications of, or waivers or
consents under, this Agreement) shall be given or made by telex, telegraph,
telecopy, cable or other writing and telexed, telecopied, telegraphed, cabled,

of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent for paying: (a) the reasonable fees

expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any

contemplated by this Agreement, any Security Document or any document referred

of title insurance procured with respect to the Liens created pursuant to the
Mortgages.

     Section 10.04. Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and each affiliate thereof and their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents from, and hold
each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or
damages to which any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses,
liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from (i) any actual or
proposed use by the Company of the proceeds of any extension of credit (whether
a Loan or a Letter of Credit) by any Lender hereunder or breach by the Company
of this Agreement or any other Basic Document, (ii) any Environmental
Liabilities, (iii) any accident, injury to or death of Persons or loss of or

thereto, and the Company shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, upon demand for any expenses (including legal fees and
fees of engineers, environmental consultants and similar technical personnel)
incurred in connection with any such investigation or proceeding; but excluding
any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified or as
a result of a successful suit by the Company seeking to enforce its rights
against such Person under the Financing Documents.

     Section 10.05. Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein or therein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes or any other Financing Document, nor any consent to any
departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the

                                       82

<PAGE>

same shall be agreed or consented to by the Majority Lenders and the Company,
and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, that:

     (a)  no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
all the Lenders, do any of the following: (i) increase any Working Capital
Commitment of any of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional
obligations (except pursuant to Section 2.17); (ii) reduce the principal of, or
interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or fees hereunder; (iii)
postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any
Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or fee hereunder pursuant to Sections 2.03, 2.05,
2.13 or 2.15 hereof; (iv) change the percentage of any of the Working Capital
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of any of the Loans and

for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this Agreement; (v)
change any provision contained in Sections 2.18, Article 4, Section 10.03, or
Section 10.04 hereof or this Section 10.05 or Section 10.08 hereof; (vi) release
all or a substantial portion of the security for the obligations of the Company
under this Agreement or any Note;

     (b)  no amendment, waiver or consent shall, without the written consent of
the Supermajority Lenders, modify the Borrowing Base to increase the advance
rate percentages applicable to any category of Collateral included therein; and

     (c)  no amendment, waiver or consent shall be made with respect to Article
9 without the consent of the Administrative Agent.

     For purposes of this Section 10.05, "Supermajority Lenders" shall mean, at
any time while no Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities are outstanding, Lenders
having at least 75% (or, if at such time there are fewer than three Lenders,
100%) of the aggregate amount of the Working Capital Commitments and, at any
time while any Loans or Letter of Credit Liabilities are outstanding, Lenders
holding at least 75% (or, if at such time there are fewer than three Lenders,
100%) of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Loans and Letter of
Credit Liabilities (including, without limitation, participations in the Letters
of Credit).

     Section 10.06. Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns except that the Company may not assign its rights or
obligations hereunder or under the Notes without the prior written consent of
all of the Lenders. Each Lender may assign any Loan or Loans or Letter of Credit
Liabilities or all or any part of its Working Capital Commitments (i) to any
affiliate thereof, (ii) to any other Lender, or (iii) with the consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to any
other Eligible Assignee; provided that any assignment shall not be less than

                                       83

<PAGE>

$2,000,000 or, if less, shall constitute an assignment of all of such Lender's
Working Capital Commitments, Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities. Upon
execution by the assignor and the assignee of an instrument pursuant to which
the assignee assumes such rights and obligations, payment by such assignee to
such assignor of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such
assignor and such assignee and delivery to the Administrative Agent and the
Company of an executed copy of such instrument together with payment by such
assignee to the Administrative Agent of a processing fee of $2,500, such
assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided
therein), the same rights and benefits as it would have if it were a Lender
hereunder and the assignor shall be, to the extent of such assignment (unless
otherwise provided therein) released from its obligations under this Agreement.
Upon the consummation of such assignment, the Company shall make appropriate
arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the assignor and the
assignee. If such assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the date of the
applicable instrument of assumption, deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 3.05(f).
Each Lender may (without the consent of any other party to this Agreement) sell
participations in all or any part of any Loan or Loans made or Letter of Credit
Liabilities held by it to another bank or other entity, in which event the
participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement (except as provided
in the next succeeding sentence hereof), or in the case of a Loan, such Lender's
Note (the participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in
favor of the participant relating thereto, which agreement shall not give the
participant the right to consent to any modification, amendment or waiver other
than one described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of Section 10.05 hereof).
The Company agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.03 and Article 4 with respect to its participation; provided that no
participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such
Sections than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such participant had no such transfer occurred. Each Lender may furnish any
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of
such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
prospective assignees and participants) which have agreed in writing to be bound
by the provisions of Section 10.07 hereof. The Administrative Agent and the
Company may, for all purposes of this Agreement, treat any Lender as the holder
of any Note drawn to its order (and owner of the Loans evidenced thereby) until
written notice of assignment or other transfer shall have been received by them
from such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any Lender may at
any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Notes
and the other Financing Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations under the Financing
Documents.

                                       84

<PAGE>

     (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
(a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC")
of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to
provide to the Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender
would otherwise be obligated to make to the Company, provided that (i) nothing
herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an
SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any
part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if,
such Loan were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto agrees that no SPC
shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would
otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting
Lender makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
10.06 any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of,
the Company or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (if consented to by the Company and the
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the
account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the
securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a
confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any
rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or
credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

     Section 10.07. Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to exercise all
reasonable efforts to keep confidential any information delivered or made
available by the Company to it which is clearly indicated to be confidential
information; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lender from
disclosing such information (i) to any other Lender, (ii) to its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys and accountants who have a need to know
such information in accordance with customary banking practices and who receive
such information having been made aware of the restrictions set forth in this
Section, (iii) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iv) upon
the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction
over such Lender, (v) which has been publicly disclosed, (vi) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Company or their respective affiliates may
be a party, (vii) to the

                                       85

<PAGE>

     extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
     hereunder, (viii) to such Lender's legal counsel and independent auditors,
     and (ix) to any actual or proposed participant or assignee of all or part
     of its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by the
     provisions of this Section 10.07.

          Section 10.08. Survival. The obligations of the Company under Sections
     2.13(g), 3.05, 4.01, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 10.03 and 10.04 hereof and the
     obligations of the Lenders under Section 10.05 shall survive the repayment
     of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of the
     Working Capital Commitments and the Letters of Credit.

          Section 10.09. Captions. The table of contents and the captions and
     section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of
     reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any
     provision of this Agreement.

          Section 10.10. Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be
     executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall
     constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may
     execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement
     constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto
     and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral and
     written, relating to the subject matter hereof (except to the extent
     specific reference is made to any such agreement in Section 2.15 hereof).

          Section 10.11. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF
     JURY TRIAL. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
     IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE COMPANY HEREBY
     SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT
     COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT
     SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT
     OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

     PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
     FORUM. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY
     IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
     PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

                                       86

          procedures) and to apply forthwith upon receipt thereof all such
          amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance of such
          Account; provided that the Company shall not (x) other than as
          expressly permitted by Section 5.2(b)(v), compromise or settle any
          dispute, claim or legal proceeding with respect to any Account for
          less than the total unpaid balance thereof or (y) other than as

          credit worthiness, the Company shall promptly so advise the
          Administrative Agent; (C) it shall not accept any note, warrant or
          other instrument (except a check or other instrument for the immediate
          payment of money) with respect to any Account without the written

          Administrative Agent consents to the acceptance of any such note,
          warrant or other instrument, it shall be considered as evidence of the
          Account and not payment thereof, and the Company shall promptly
          deliver such note, warrant or instrument to the Administrative Agent,
          appropriately endorsed and regardless of the form of presentment,
          demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and notice of protest with
          respect thereto, the account debtor shall remain liable thereon until
          such note, warrant or instrument is paid

                                       93

<PAGE>

          in full); (D) it shall notify the Administrative Agent promptly of all
          disputes and claims (other than as to discounts required by contract
          or agreement made in the ordinary course of business and corrections
          of billing errors in the ordinary course of business) with any account
          debtor, involving in excess of $250,000 for any single dispute or
          claim and in excess of $500,000 for all such disputes and claims,
          whether any such account debtor is acting in its capacity as an
          account debtor or in its individual capacity; (E) it shall not grant
          any discount, credit or allowance with respect to any Account to any
          account debtor without the consent of the Administrative Agent, except
          for: (i) discounts or rebates required by contract or agreement made
          in the ordinary course of business and corrections of billing errors
          in the ordinary course of business; and (ii) any other discount which
          does not exceed $150,000, provided that the aggregate amount of
          discounts permitted pursuant to this clause (ii) during any calendar
          year with respect to any single account debtor shall not exceed
          $500,000; (F) if an account debtor returns any Inventory to the
          Company when no Event of Default exists, then the Company shall
          promptly determine the reason for such return and shall issue a credit
          memorandum to the account debtor in the appropriate amount; provided
          that the Company shall immediately report to the Administrative Agent
          in the event that the aggregate amount of such returns exceed $700,000
          during any year with respect to any single account debtor (which
          report shall indicate the reasons for the returns and the locations
          and condition of the returned Inventory); and (G) if an account debtor
          returns any Inventory to the Company when an Event of Default exists
          and such Inventory is returned in a condition that makes it unfit for
          resale in the ordinary course of business, the Company shall: (i) hold
          such returned Inventory in trust for the Administrative Agent; (ii)
          segregate all such returned Inventory from all of its other property;
          (iii) dispose of such returned Inventory solely according to the
          written instructions of the Administrative Agent; and (iv) not issue
          any credits or allowances with respect thereto without the prior
          written consent of the Majority Lenders. All returned Inventory shall
          remain subject to the Administrative Agent's security interest.
          Whenever any Inventory is returned for which a Account had been
          created, such Account shall be credited to the extent of such returned
          Inventory, with the credit reported in the Weekly Collateral
          Certificate; and

                (vi)  it shall use its best efforts to keep in full force and
          effect any Supporting Obligation or Collateral Support relating to any
          Account.

                                       94

            (c)   Delivery and Control of Accounts. The Company will promptly
      deliver and pledge each Instrument to the Administrative Agent,
      appropriately endorsed to the Administrative Agent, provided that so long
      as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company
      may retain for collection in the ordinary course any Instruments (other
      than checks and drafts constituting payments in respect of Accounts, as to
      which the provisions of Section 5.2(d) shall apply) received by it in the
      ordinary course of business and the Administrative Agent shall, promptly
      upon request of the Company, make appropriate arrangements for making any
      other Instrument pledged by the Company available to it for purposes of
      presentation, collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected,
      to the extent deemed appropriate to the Administrative Agent, against
      trust receipt or like document).

            (d)   Collection of Accounts.

                    (i)  On or before the Phase I Effective Date, the Company
            shall (A) direct all of its account debtors to make all payments on
            Accounts directly to one or more Lockboxes or Controlled Accounts,
            (B) establish Controlled Accounts with the Administrative Agent or
            such other financial institutions as shall be acceptable to the
            Administrative Agent, into which all payments received in the
            Lockboxes shall be deposited, and into which the Company will
            promptly deposit all payments made for Inventory or other assets or
            services sold or rendered by the Company and received by the Company
            in the identical form in which such payments were made, whether by
            cash or check; and (C) cause each Subsidiary, and any other Person
            acting for or in concert with the Company or its Subsidiaries that
            receives any monies, checks, notes, drafts or other payments
            relating to or as proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral, to
            promptly remit the same (or cause the same to be remitted) in hand
            to the Controlled Accounts.

                    (ii) The Company agrees to pay all reasonable fees, costs
            and expenses which the Company and its Subsidiaries incur in
            connection with opening and maintaining any Lockbox and Controlled
            Account. All of such fees, costs and expenses which remain unpaid
            pursuant to any Lockbox Agreement or Controlled Account Agreement to
            the extent the same shall have been paid by the Administrative Agent
            hereunder, shall constitute Loans under the Credit Agreement, shall
            be payable to the Administrative Agent by the Company on demand,
            and, until paid, shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base
            Rate Loans at such time. All checks, drafts, instruments and other
            items of payment or proceeds of Collateral delivered to the
            Administrative Agent in kind shall be

                                       95

<PAGE>

            endorsed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the Administrative
            Agent, and, if that endorsement of any such item shall not be made
            for any reason, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably
            authorized to endorse the same on behalf of the Company and its
            Subsidiaries, notwithstanding the inclusion on any such item of
            restrictive notations such as "paid in full", "balance of account",
            or other restrictions.

                    (iii) Without limiting Section 6, for the purpose of this
            Section 5.2(d), and effective so long as this Agreement shall remain
            in force and effect, the Company, on behalf of itself and its
            Subsidiaries, irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and appoints the
            Administrative Agent (and all Persons designated by the
            Administrative Agent for that purpose) as the Company's or such
            Subsidiary's true and lawful attorney and agent-in-fact (A) to
            endorse the name of the Company or its Subsidiary upon said items of
            payment and/or proceeds of Collateral of the Company and upon any
            chattel paper, document, instrument, invoice or similar document or
            agreement relating to any Account or goods pertaining thereto; (B)
            to take control in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds
            thereof; (C) to have access to any Lockbox or postal box into which
            any checks or other forms of payment in respect of Accounts are
            remitted; and (D) open all mail containing checks and other forms of
            payment in respect of Accounts and process such checks and other
            forms of payment.

                    (iv)  The Administrative Agent (and all Persons designated
            by the Administrative Agent for such purpose) may, at any time and
            from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of
            an Event of Default, whether before or after notification to any
            account debtor and whether before or after the maturity of any of
            the Secured Obligations, (A) enforce collection of any Accounts or
            contract right of the Company by suit or otherwise; (B) exercise all
            of the rights and remedies of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
            respect to proceedings brought to collect any Accounts; (C)
            surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts of
            the Company and its Subsidiaries, or compromise or extend or renew
            for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any
            indebtedness thereunder; (D) sell or assign any Account of the
            Company and its Subsidiaries upon such terms, for such amount and at
            such time or times as the Administrative Agent deems advisable; (E)
            prepare, file and sign the names of the Company and its Subsidiaries
            on any proof of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document
            against any account debtor indebted on an Account; and (F) do all
            other acts and things

                                       96

<PAGE>

            which are necessary, in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion,
            to fulfill the Secured Obligations and to allow the Administrative
            Agent to collect the Accounts. In addition to any other provision
            hereof or in any of the other Financing Documents, the
            Administrative Agent may at any time on or after the occurrence of
            an Event of Default, at the sole expense of Company and its
            Subsidiaries, notify any parties obligated on any of the Accounts to
            make payment directly eto the Administrative Agent of any amounts
            due or to become due thereunder.

                 (v) In the event that any account debtor remits any payments
            directly to the Company rather than to a Lockbox or a Controlled
            Account, the Company shall promptly take all steps, if any,
            necessary or advisable to ensure the validity, perfection, priority
            and, if applicable, control of the Administrative Agent over such
            payments (including, without limitation, delivery thereof to the
            Administrative Agent) and pending any such action the Company shall
            be deemed to hold such payments in trust for the benefit of the
            Administrative Agent and such payments shall be segregated from all
            other property of the Company.

       Section 11.05. Amendment to Section 9. (a)Section 9(A) of the Security
Agreement is amended by amending paragraphs third and fourth thereof, and adding
paragraph fifth thereof, to read in their entirety as follows:

            third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the Secured
       Obligations (other than the Additional Secured Obligations) (or to the
       provision for payment thereof pursuant to Section 9(B) below);

            fourth, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the Secured
       Obligations (other than the Additional Secured Obligations) (or to the
       provision for payment thereof pursuant to Section 9(B) below);

            fifth, to the ratable payment of the Additional Secured Obligations
       (or to the provision for payment thereof pursuant to Section 9(B) below);

       (b) Section 9(B) of the Security Agreement is amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

            (B) If at any time any portion of any monies collected or received
       by the Administrative Agent would, but for the provisions of this Section
       9(B), be payable pursuant to Section 9(A) in respect of the Contingent
       Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent shall not apply any monies
       to pay such Contingent Secured Obligation but instead shall request the
       holder thereof, at least five Business Days before each proposed

                                       97

<PAGE>

         distribution hereunder, to notify the Administrative Agent as to the
         maximum amount of such Contingent Secured Obligation if then
         ascertainable (e.g., in the case of a letter of credit, the maximum
         amount available for subsequent drawings thereunder). If the holder of
         such Contingent Secured Obligation does not notify the Administrative
         Agent of the maximum ascertainable amount thereof at least two Business
         Days before such distribution, such holder will not be entitled to
         share in such distribution. If such holder does so notify the
         Administrative Agent as to the maximum ascertainable amount thereof,
         the Administrative Agent will allocate to such holder a portion of the
         monies to be distributed in such distribution, calculated as if such
         Contingent Secured Obligation were outstanding in such maximum
         ascertainable amount. However, the Administrative Agent will not apply
         such portion of such monies to pay such Contingent Secured Obligation,
         but instead will hold such monies or invest such monies in Liquid
         Investments. All such monies and Liquid Investments and all proceeds
         thereof will constitute Collateral hereunder, but will be subject to
         distribution in accordance with this Section 9(B) rather than Section
         9(A). The Administrative Agent will hold all such monies and Liquid
         Investments and the net proceeds thereof in trust until all or part of
         such Contingent Secured Obligation becomes a Non-Contingent Secured
         Obligation, whereupon the Administrative Agent at the request of the
         relevant Secured Party will apply the amount so held in trust to pay
         such Non-Contingent Secured Obligation; provided that, if the other
         Secured Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of
         Section 9(A) (i.e., clause third, fourth or fifth) were not paid in
         full, the Administrative Agent will apply the amount so held in trust
         to pay the same percentage of such Non-Contingent Secured Obligation as
         the percentage of such other Secured Obligations theretofore paid
         pursuant to the same clause of Section 9(A). If (i) the holder of such
         Contingent Secured Obligation shall advise the Administrative Agent
         that no portion thereof remains in the category of a Contingent Secured
         Obligation and (ii) the Administrative Agent still holds any amount
         held in trust pursuant to this Section 9(B) in respect of such
         Contingent Secured Obligation (after paying all amounts payable
         pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to any portions thereof
         that became Non-Contingent Secured Obligations), such remaining amount
         will be applied by the Administrative Agent in the order of priorities
         set forth in Section 9(A).

                 (iii) any other obligation (including any Guaranty) that is
            contingent in nature at such time; or

                 (iv)  an obligation to provide collateral to secure any of the

       (c) Section 1 of the Pledge Agreement is amended by deleting the
definition of "Collateral Account".

       Section 12.02. Amendment to Section 13. (a)Section 13(A) of the Pledge
Agreement is amended by amending paragraphs third and fourth thereof, and adding
paragraph fifth thereof, to read in their entirety as follows:

            third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the Secured
       Obligations (other than the Additional Secured Obligations) (or to the

            fourth, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the Secured

<PAGE>

     (b) Section 13(B) of the Pledge Agreement is amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

          (B) If at any time any portion of any monies collected or received by
     the Administrative Agent would, but for the provisions of this Section
     13(B), be payable pursuant to Section 13(A) in respect of the Contingent
     Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent shall not apply any monies to
     pay such Contingent Secured Obligation but instead shall request the holder
     thereof, at least five Business Days before each proposed distribution
     hereunder, to notify the Administrative Agent as to the maximum amount of
     such Contingent Secured Obligation if then ascertainable (e.g., in the case
     of a letter of credit, the maximum amount available for subsequent drawings
     thereunder). If the holder of such Contingent Secured Obligation does not
     notify the Administrative Agent of the maximum ascertainable amount thereof
     at least two Business Days before such distribution, such holder will not
     be entitled to share in such distribution. If such holder does so notify
     the Administrative Agent as to the maximum ascertainable amount thereof,
     the Administrative Agent will allocate to such holder a portion of the
     monies to be distributed in such distribution, calculated as if such
     Contingent Secured Obligation were outstanding in such maximum
     ascertainable amount. However, the Administrative Agent will not apply such
     portion of such monies to pay such Contingent Secured Obligation, but
     instead will hold such monies or invest such monies in Liquid Investments.
     All such monies and Liquid Investments and all proceeds thereof will
     constitute Collateral hereunder, but will be subject to distribution in
     accordance with this Section 13(B) rather than Section 13(A). The
     Administrative Agent will hold all such monies and Liquid Investments and
     the net proceeds thereof in trust until all or part of such Contingent
     Secured Obligation becomes a Non-Contingent Secured Obligation, whereupon
     the Administrative Agent at the request of the relevant Secured Party will
     apply the amount so held in trust to pay such Non-Contingent Secured
     Obligation; provided that, if the other Secured Obligations theretofore
     paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 13(A) (i.e., clause third,
     fourth or fifth) were not paid in full, the Administrative Agent will apply
     the amount so held in trust to pay the same percentage of such
     Non-Contingent Secured Obligation as the percentage of such other Secured
     Obligations theretofore paid pursuant to the same clause of Section 13(A).
     If (i) the holder of such Contingent Secured Obligation shall advise the
     Administrative Agent that no portion thereof remains in the category of a
     Contingent Secured Obligation and (ii) the Administrative Agent still holds
     any amount held in trust pursuant to this Section 13(B) in respect of such
     Contingent Secured Obligation (after paying all amounts payable pursuant to
     the preceding sentence with respect to any portions thereof that became
     Non-Contingent Secured

     Obligations), such remaining amount will be applied by the Administrative
     Agent in the order of priorities set forth in Section 13(A).

     Section 12.03 Miscellaneous Amendments. (a) Section 13(A) of the Pledge
Agreement is amended by replacing the reference to "Section 12.03" in paragraph
first thereof with a reference to "Section 10.03".

     (b) Section 14 of the Pledge Agreement is amended by replacing the
reference to "Section 11" therein with a reference to "Article 9".

                              Environmental Matters

1.   Asbestos is present throughout the facilities located in Covington,
     Virginia ("Covington") and Terre Haute, Indiana ("Terre Haute").

2.   An open AST issue at Covington exists in regard to an abandoned, removed
     AST formerly used for "used machine lubrications" where ground
     contamination was detected and corrected. All DEQ notifications are in
     order.

3.   The Covington facility has three wastewater lagoons which are permitted by
     the VPDES. Phase II testing at and near the site of the lagoons indicates
     that there may be levels of 1,1-dichloroethene and heptachlor epoxide
     exceeding levels of state regulatory concern. This is monitored each time a
     permit is renewed. No EPA or DEQ monitoring or correction action has been
     mandated.

4.   The Covington facility is listed on CERCLIS with the notation "no further
     action". The Company is aware that two disposal sites used in connection
     with the Covington facility, Cyanokem, in Detroit, Michigan. and Chem Met
     Services in Wyandotte, Michigan are listed on the Michigan State Priority
     List.

5.   There is a former on-site solid waste disposal area at Covington (not
     including the area to be retained by Hercules, Inc. known as the Hercules
     Industrial Landfill) located near the wastewater lagoon. Results of testing
     conducted at or near this area are described in no. 4 above.

6.   In 1992, approximately 2,400 gallons of no. 2 fuel oil were released as a
     result of the overfill of an aboveground fuel oil storage tank at Terre
     Haute. Hercules, Inc. executed the cleanup and did not seek a site closure.

7.   The facility located in Varennes, Quebec has conducted training at a "fire
     practice area" where small amounts of gasoline, no. 2 fuel oil and kerosene
     were ignited. It is possible that some of the petroleum compounds were
     spilled and/or spread on the soils in the area.

8.   The Company has received an information request with respect to the Solvent
     Recovery Services of New England Site in Southington, Connecticut. A
     predecessor entity has assumed responsibility for that notice.

9.   Terre Haute water and air permits are pending action by Indiana Department
     of Environmental Management (IDEM) action. All applications were timely
     submitted.

10.  Terre Haute's pH levels have exceeded the pH parameters of its NPDES permit
     at times.

<PAGE>

11.  Written Notices have been received by:

     a.   Terre Haute for exceeding drinking water lead and copper levels. IDEM
          has provided feedback on the corrective action plan, and AET has until
          2005 to implement it.

     b.   Covington has received one "Warning Letter" from DEQ for not
          inspecting an abandoned A.S.T. (tank removed as corrective action),
          and not having two AST level gages at loading station for the 2 fuel
          oil tanks. (2 tank gages were installed). The case was reviewed by DEQ
          in 2002 and noted as complete.

     c.   "Warning Letters" received from DEQ for missing data on V.P.D.E.S. DMR
          reports. Warning letter is the most minimal method of formal
          communication from DEQ. All corrections to data submitted. No pending
          action.

     d.   Covington has received "Warning Letters" for vegetation control on lab
          methods under VPDES permit. Corrective actions taken. No pending
          actions.

12.  There are two underground fuel oil storage tanks at Terre Haute that have
     been "environmentally cleaned" and abandoned in place. Formal IDEM closure
     conducted.

13.  Threshold planning quantities of hazardous substances exist at Terre Haute
     and Covington such as VDC, sulfuric acid, MMA, etc. All are used for raw
     materials to processes.

14.  Terre Haute is listed in an environmental database noting an unresolved
     LUST (Leaking Underground Storage Tank). Hercules removed the tank in 1989,
     but minor soil contamination remained. There is no action planned on this
     issue; the item is listed in the database as "Priority Low."

To the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent
Referred to Below
c/o JPMorgan Chase Bank
270 Park Avenue
New York, NY  10017-2070

Dear Sirs:

         We have acted as counsel for Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 7, 1994, as amended and
restated as of January 21, 2003 (as so amended and restated, the "Amended
Agreement"), among the Company, the lenders listed on the signature pages
thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. This opinion is
delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(e) of the Amended Agreement. Terms defined in
the Amended Agreement, including in the schedules and exhibits thereto, and not
otherwise defined herein are used herein as defined in the Amended Agreement,
including in such schedules and exhibits.

         We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of
public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other
investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for
purposes of this opinion. As to questions of fact not independently verified by
us, we have relied, to the extent we deemed appropriate, upon representations
and certificates of officers of the Company, public officials and other
appropriate persons and on the representations as to matters of fact (not
constituting conclusions of law) set forth in the Amended Agreement.

         The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the
internal laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the federal law of the United States of America.

         Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

         1. Each of the Company and Applied Extrusion Technologies (Canada),
Inc. (the "Subsidiary Guarantor") is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power required to carry on its business as now conducted
as described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year
ended September 30, 2002 that is to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, in the form delivered to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
date hereof.

         2. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Amended Agreement
and the Notes and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder
and under the Pledge Agreement identified on Schedule II to the Amended Credit
Agreement, as amended by the Amended Agreement (the "Pledge Agreement"), the
Security Agreement, as amended by the Amended Agreement (the Pledge Agreement
and the Security Agreement, together with the Amended Agreement and the Notes,
the "Company Documents"), and the Mortgages identified on Schedule II to the
Amended Credit Agreement to which it is a party (i) are within the Company's
corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, (ii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official (except as contemplated by the Security
Documents and the Mortgages), and (iii) do not contravene, or constitute a
default under (or, in the case of clause (c) below, result in the creation of
any Lien on the assets of the Company under), any provision of (a) New York or
federal law or regulation or of the DGCL, (b) the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company or (c) the Indenture dated as of June 19, 2001, as in
effect on the date hereof (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo
Bank Minnesota, National Association, Trustee, relating to the Company's 10 3/4
% Senior Notes due 2011.

         3. The execution and delivery by the Subsidiary Guarantor of the
Guarantor Acknowledgment and the performance by the Subsidiary Guarantor of its
obligations thereunder and under the Subsidiary Guaranty (the Subsidiary
Guaranty, together with the Guarantor Acknowledgment, the "Guarantor Documents",
and together with the Company Documents, the "Credit Documents") and the
Mortgage to which it is a party (i) are within the Subsidiary Guarantor's
corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, (ii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official (except as contemplated by the Security
Documents), and (iii) do not contravene, or constitute a default under (or, in
the case of clause (c) below, result in the creation of any Lien on the assets
of the Subsidiary Guarantor under) any provision of (a) New York or federal law
or regulation or of the DGCL, (b) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Subsidiary Guarantor or (c) the Indenture.

         4. Subject to the qualifications appearing after the numbered
paragraphs hereof, the Company Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company, in each case enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms.

         5. Subject to the qualifications appearing after the numbered
paragraphs hereof, the Guarantor Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable against the Subsidiary
Guarantor in accordance with their terms.

         6. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantor is an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
and, to our knowledge is not, directly or indirectly, controlled by or acting on
behalf of any Person which is an "investment company" within the meaning of said
Act.

         7. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantor is a "holding
company" or, to our knowledge, an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         8. The security interests created by the Security Agreement and the
Pledge Agreement secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in each of the
Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement) in respect of all future Loans made
by the Lenders to, and all obligations with respect to Letters of Credit
incurred by, the Company under the Amended Agreement, whether or not at the time
such Loans are made or obligations incurred an Event of Default or other event
not within the control of the Lenders has relieved or may relieve the Lenders
from their obligations to make such Loans or to perform under Letters of Credit.

         9. To our knowledge, neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantor
is a party to any action, suit or proceeding before any court, governmental
agency or arbitrator which places in question the validity or enforceability of,
or seeks to enjoin the performance of, any Credit Document or Mortgage.

         Our opinion that the relevant Credit Documents of the Company or the
Subsidiary Guarantor constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations, is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors and secured parties and (ii) general principles of
equity, regardless of whether applied in proceedings in equity or at law.

         The opinions expressed herein do not purport to cover, and we express
no opinion with respect to, the applicability of Section 548 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law.

         The opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that the
enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents providing for
indemnification or contribution may be limited by public policy considerations.
In addition, we express no opinion as to (i) the extent to which broadly worded
waivers may be enforced, (ii) the enforceability of any provision of the Credit
Documents which purports to grant the right of setoff to a purchaser of a
participation in the loans outstanding thereunder or which provides for interest
on interest or automatic compounding interest, (iii) the extent to which
provisions providing for conclusive presumptions or determinations,
non-effectiveness of oral modifications, arbitration, submission to
jurisdiction, waiver of or consent to service of process and venue or waiver of
offset or defenses will be enforced, or (iv) the ordinances, statutes,
administrative decisions, orders, rules and regulations of any municipality,
county, special district or other political subdivision of the State of New
York.

         In addition, certain provisions contained in the Credit Documents,
including the grant of powers of attorney thereunder, may be unenforceable in
whole or in part but the inclusion of such provisions in the Credit Documents
does not affect the validity of any of the other provisions thereof, and the
remaining provisions of the Credit Documents are sufficient for the practical
realization of the benefits intended to be provided thereby.

         We further express no opinion as to the existence of, or as to the
title of any Person who has granted a security interest in any collateral under
the Security Documents (the "Collateral"), to any item of Collateral or as to
the priority or the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral. For
purposes of paragraph 8 above, we express no opinion with respect to security
interests in goods which are in accession to, or commingled or processed with
other goods to the extent that a security interest is limited by Section 9-336
of New York Article 9 or Article 9 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code.

         This opinion is solely for the benefit of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent in connection with the transactions provided for in or
contemplated by the Amended Agreement. It may not be otherwise distributed or
relied upon by any Person or quoted or reproduced, in whole or in part, in any
other document or filed with any government agency without our prior written
consent except that a copy of this opinion may be delivered to any participant
or assignee under the Amended Agreement.

                                                     Very truly yours,

repaired by third parties in the ordinary course of business, Inventory in
transit and Inventory held by warehousemen.

       (C) Not later than the date of the first borrowing under the Credit
Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Perfection Certificate to the
Administrative Agent. The information set forth therein shall be correct and
complete. Not later than 60 days following the date of the first borrowing, the
Company shall furnish to the Administrative Agent file search reports from each
filing office set forth in Schedule 7 to the Perfection Certificate or other
evidence satisfactory to the Majority Lenders acting through the Administrative
Agent confirming the filing information set forth in such Schedule.


       (D) The Security Interests constitute valid security interests under the
UCC securing the Secured Obligations. When UCC financing statements in the form
specified in the Perfection Certificate have been filed in the offices specified
in the Perfection Certificate, and this Agreement and any amendments hereto in
appropriate form have been filed in the office of the Secretary of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, with respect to any Rolling Stock, Leased

perfected security interests in the Collateral (except Inventory in transit) to
the extent that a security interest therein may be perfected by filing pursuant
to the UCC and the Interstate Commerce Act, prior to all other Liens and rights
of others therein except for the Permitted Liens. When the Patent Security
Agreement and the Trademark Security Agreement have been filed with the United
States Patent and Trademark

                                       6

Office, the Security Interests shall constitute perfected security interests in
all right, title and interest of the Company in Patents and Trademarks, prior to
all other Liens and rights of others therein except for the Permitted Liens.
When a Copyright Security Agreement has been filed with the United States
Copyright Office, the Security Interests shall constitute perfected security
interests in all right, title and interest of the Company in Copyrights, prior
to all other Liens and rights of others therein except for the Permitted Liens.

       (E) The Inventory and Equipment are insured in accordance with the
requirements of the Credit Agreement.

       (F) All Inventory has or will have been produced in compliance with the
applicable requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended.

       SECTION 3. The Security Interests

       (A) In order to secure the full and punctual payment of the Secured
Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, and to secure the performance

                (8)  All books and records (including, without limitation,
       customer lists, marketing information, credit files, price lists,
       operating records, vendor and supplier price lists, sales literature,
       computer programs, disks, printouts and other computer materials and

                                       7

<PAGE>

         the Company or any servicing agency) of the Company pertaining to any
         of the Collateral;

                  (9)  All right, title, claims and benefits now owned or
         hereafter acquired by the Company in and to any railcar leases,
         subleases, rental agreements and car hire contracts in which the
         Company shall at any time have any interest, and any right, title,
         claim and benefits of the Company now owned or hereafter acquired in
         and to any management agreement concerning all such leases and
         agreements (collectively, "Rolling Stock Leases"); and all right, title
         and interest of the Company in the railcars and equipment provided
         pursuant to any Rolling Stock Leases ("Leased Rolling Stock"); in each
         case, including, without limitation, all rights of the Company to
         receive and apply any Rolling Stock Revenues attributable to any Leased
         Rolling Stock or pursuant to any Rolling Stock Leases; and

                  (10) All Proceeds of, attachments or accessions to, or
         substitutions for, all or any of the Collateral described in Clauses 1
         through 10 hereof.

         (B) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not
subject the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to, or transfer or
in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of the Company with
respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in connection therewith.

         SECTION 4.  Further Assurances; Covenants

         (A) (I) The Company will not change (i) the location of its chief
executive office or its chief place of business or (ii) the locations where it
keeps or holds any Collateral (other than Inventory and Rolling Stock in
transit) or records relating thereto from the applicable location described in
the Perfection Certificate unless it shall have given the Administrative Agent
notice thereof and taken all steps reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent to perfect the Security Interests contemplated hereby with respect to the
new location in question (including without limitation an opinion of counsel, if
so requested). The Company shall not in any event change the location of any
Collateral if such change would cause the Security Interests in such Collateral
to lapse or cease to be perfected.

         (II) The Company will not change its name, identity or corporate
structure in any manner unless it shall have given the Administrative Agent
prior notice thereof and taken all steps reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent to perfect the Security Interests contemplated hereby in
connection with such change (including without limitation an opinion of counsel,
if so requested).

         (B)  The Company will, from time to time, at its expense, execute,
deliver, file and record any statement, assignment, instrument, document,
agreement or other paper and take any other action (including, without
limitation, any filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any
filings with the United States Copyright Office, any filings with the Interstate
Commerce Commission,

                                       8

<PAGE>

any filings of financing or continuation statements under the UCC and any
filings in, or agreements governed by the laws of, any foreign jurisdictions)
that from time to time may be necessary or desirable, or that the Administrative
Agent may request, in order to create, preserve, upgrade in rank (to the extent
required hereby), perfect, confirm or validate the Security Interests or to
enable the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties to obtain the full
benefits of this Agreement, or to enable the Administrative Agent to exercise
and enforce, or facilitate the exercise and enforcement of, any of its rights,
powers and remedies hereunder with respect to any of the Collateral. To the
extent permitted by law, the Company hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent
to execute and file financing statements or continuation statements without the
Company's signature appearing thereon. The Company agrees that a carbon,
photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or of a financing statement
is sufficient as a financing statement. The Company shall pay the costs of, or
incidental to, any recording or filing of any financing or continuation
statements concerning the Collateral.

     (C) If any Collateral is at any time in the possession or control of any
warehouseman, bailee or any of the Company's agents or processors, the Company
shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent acting on the instructions
of the Majority Lenders, notify such warehouseman, bailee, agent or processor of
the Security Interests created hereby and instruct such Person to hold all such
Collateral for the Administrative Agent's account subject to the Administrative
Agent's instructions.

     (D) The Company shall keep full and accurate books and records relating to
the Collateral, and stamp or otherwise mark such books and records in such
manner as the Majority Lenders may reasonably request in order to reflect the
Security Interests.

     (E) The Company will immediately deliver and pledge each Instrument to the
Administrative Agent, appropriately endorsed to the Administrative Agent,
provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may retain for collection in the ordinary course any
Instruments (other than checks and drafts constituting payments in respect of
Accounts, as to which the provisions of Section 5(B) shall apply) received by it
in the ordinary course of business and the Administrative Agent shall, promptly
upon request of the Company, make appropriate arrangements for making any other
Instrument pledged by the Company available to it for purposes of presentation,
collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected, to the extent deemed
appropriate to the Administrative Agent, against trust receipt or like
document).

     (F) The Company shall use its best efforts, subject to reasonable business
practices, to collect from its account debtors, as and when due, any and all
amounts owing under or on account of each Account (including, without
limitation, Accounts which are delinquent, such Accounts to be collected in

                                       9

<PAGE>

accordance with lawful collection procedures) and to apply forthwith upon
receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance
of such Account. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
the Administrative Agent is exercising its rights hereunder to collect Accounts,
the Company may allow in the ordinary course of business as adjustments to
amounts owing under its Accounts (i) an extension or renewal of the time or
times of payment, or settlement for less than the total unpaid balance, which
the Company finds appropriate in accordance with sound business judgment and
(ii) a refund or credit due as a result of returned or damaged merchandise, all
in accordance with the Company's ordinary course of business consistent with its
historical collection practices. The costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorney's fees) of collection, whether incurred by the Company or
the Administrative Agent, shall be borne by the Company.

     (G) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
upon the request of the Majority Lenders acting through the Administrative
Agent, the Company will promptly notify (and the Company hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent so to notify) each account debtor in respect of any Account
or Instrument that such Collateral has been assigned to the Administrative Agent
hereunder, and that any payments due or to become due in respect of such
Collateral are to be made directly to the Administrative Agent or its designee.

     (H) The Company shall, (i) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, in
the case of Equipment now owned constituting goods in which a security interest
is perfected by a notation on the certificate of title or similar evidence of
the ownership of such goods, and (ii) within 10 days of acquiring any other
similar Equipment, in each case, (a) having a value in excess of $50,000 or (b)
having a value in excess of $25,000, if the aggregate of all such items owned by
the Company at any time is greater than $100,000, deliver to the Administrative
Agent any and all certificates of title, applications for title or similar
evidence of ownership of such Equipment and shall cause the Administrative Agent
to be named as lienholder on any such certificate of title or other evidence of
ownership; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to up to three
automobiles owned by the Company unless the Administrative Agent otherwise so
requests. The Company shall not permit any such items to become a fixture to
real estate other than real estate described in the Mortgages.

     (I) The Company shall as soon as practicable after the date hereof, at its
own cost and expense, cause to be plainly, distinctly, permanently and
conspicuously placed, fastened or painted upon each side of each item of Rolling
Stock a legend bearing such words as the Administrative Agent may request
indicating the Lien over and security interest in such Rolling Stock created
hereby in letters not less than one inch in height. The Company may permit the
Rolling Stock to be operated within the United States, but shall not permit the
Rolling Stock to be operated outside the boundaries of the continental United
States.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     (J) Without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders, the Company
will not (a) sell, lease, exchange, assign or otherwise dispose of, or grant any
option with respect to, any Collateral except, subject to the rights of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, as permitted under Section 9.12 of the Credit
Agreement and, in the case of any such disposition, the Security Interests
created hereby in such item (but not in any Proceeds arising from such sale or
exchange) shall cease immediately without any further action on the part of the
Administrative Agent; or (b) create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien with
respect to any Collateral, except for the Permitted Liens.

     (K) The Company will maintain insurance in accordance with Section 9.03 of
the Credit Agreement.

     (L) The Company will, promptly upon request, provide to the Administrative
Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request concerning the
Collateral, and in particular the Accounts, to enable the Administrative Agent
to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

     (M) If the Company shall, either itself or through any agent, employee or
licensee, file an application for the registration of any Copyright with the
United States Copyright Office or any Patent or Trademark with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, or with any similar office or agency in any other
country or any political subdivision thereof, not less than 30 days thereafter
it shall inform the Administrative Agent, and, upon request of the
Administrative Agent, execute and deliver any and all agreements, instruments,
documents and papers the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the
Security Interests in such Copyright, Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and
general intangibles of the Company relating thereto or represented thereby, and
the Company hereby constitutes the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact to
execute and file all such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such
attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; such power, being coupled with an
interest, shall be irrevocable until the Secured Obligations are paid in full.

     (N) If the Administrative Agent shall so request, based on its
determination that changed circumstances warrant such a request, the Company
shall, at its cost and expense, cause to be delivered to the Secured Parties an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to such matters
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as the Majority Lenders may
reasonably request.

     Section 5. Collateral Account

     (A) There is hereby established with the Administrative Agent a cash
collateral account (the "Collateral Account") in the name and under the control
of the Administrative Agent into which there shall be deposited from time to
time the cash proceeds of the Collateral required to be delivered to the
Administrative

                                       11

<PAGE>

Agent pursuant to subsection (B) of this Section 5 or any other provision of
this Agreement, any other Security Document or the Credit Agreement. Any income
received by the Administrative Agent with respect to the balance from time to
time standing to the credit of the Collateral Account, including any interest or
capital gains on Liquid Investments, shall remain, or be deposited, in the
Collateral Account. All right, title and interest in and to the cash amounts on
deposit from time to time in the Collateral Account together with any Liquid
Investments from time to time made pursuant to subsection (D) of this Section
shall vest in the Administrative Agent, shall constitute part of the Collateral
hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Secured Obligations until
applied thereto as hereinafter provided.

     (B) The Company shall instruct all account debtors and other Persons
obligated in respect of all Accounts to make all payments in respect of such
Accounts either (i) directly to the Administrative Agent (by instructing that
such payments be remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name and
under the control of the Administrative Agent) or (ii) to one or more other
banks in any state (other than Louisiana) in the United States (each a "Lockbox
Bank") (by instructing that such payments be remitted to a post office box which
shall be in the name and under the control of such Lockbox Bank) for deposit
into an account in the name and under the control of such Lockbox Bank (a
"Lockbox Account") under a Lockbox Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit G
hereto duly executed by the Company and such Lockbox Bank or under other
arrangements, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
pursuant to which the Company shall have irrevocably instructed such Lockbox
Bank (and such Lockbox Bank shall have agreed) to remit all proceeds of such
payments directly to the Administrative Agent for deposit into the Collateral
Account or as the Administrative Agent may otherwise instruct such Lockbox Bank;
provided that on or prior to the 60th day after the Closing Date, account
debtors and other Persons obligated in respect of such Accounts shall be
permitted to make all payments in respect of such Accounts to one or more other
banks for deposit in an account in the name and control of Hercules
Incorporated, such payments to be remitted by Hercules Incorporated to the
Company. Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall instruct such Lockbox Bank to remit
such proceeds to the Company or as the Company may otherwise so instruct such
Lockbox Bank. All such payments made to the Administrative Agent shall be
deposited in the Collateral Account. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
agrees that if the proceeds of any Collateral hereunder (including the payments
made in respect of Accounts) shall be received by it, the Company shall as
promptly as possible deposit such proceeds into a Lockbox Account. Until so
deposited, all such proceeds shall be held in trust by the Company for and as
the property of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties and shall not
be commingled with any other funds or property of the Company.

     (C) The balance from time to time standing to the credit of the Collateral
Account shall, except (i) upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of

                                       12

<PAGE>

Default or (ii) as provided by Section 3.02(b)(i)(2) of the Credit Agreement, be
distributed to the Company upon the order of the Company. If immediately
available cash on deposit in the Collateral Account is not sufficient to make
any distribution to the Company referred to in the previous sentence of this
Section 5(C), the Administrative Agent shall liquidate as promptly as
practicable Liquid Investments as required to obtain sufficient cash to make
such distribution and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5,
such distribution shall not be made until such liquidation has taken place. Upon
the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent
shall, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, apply or cause to be applied
(subject to collection) any or all of the balance from time to time standing to
the credit of the Collateral Account in the manner specified in Section 9.

     (D) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested and
re-invested from time to time in such Liquid Investments as the Company shall
determine, which Liquid Investments shall be held in the name and be under the
control of the Administrative Agent, provided that, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, if instructed by the
Majority Lenders, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and apply or cause to be
applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations in the
manner specified in Section 9. For this purpose, (i) each Liquid Investment
shall mature within 30 days after it is acquired by the Administrative Agent and
(ii) in order to provide the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Secured Parties, with a perfected security interest therein, each Liquid
Investment shall be either:

          (i) evidenced by negotiable certificates or instruments, or if
     non-negotiable then issued in the name of the Administrative Agent, which
     (together with any appropriate instruments of transfer) are delivered to,
     and held by, the Administrative Agent or an agent thereof (which shall not
     be the Company or any of its Affiliates) in the State of New York; or

          (ii) in book-entry form and issued by the United States and subject to
     pledge under applicable state law and Treasury regulations and as to which
     (in the opinion of counsel to the Administrative Agent) appropriate
     measures shall have been taken for perfection of the Security Interests.

     SECTION 6. General Authority

     The Company hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true
and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Company, the Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the
sole use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties,
but at the Company's expense, to the extent permitted by law to exercise, at any
time and from time to time while an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, all or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the
Collateral:

                                       13

<PAGE>

                (i)   to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance
         for any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue
         thereof, including without limitation the endorsement of the Company's
         name on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, drafts or other
         forms of payment,

                (ii)  to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any
         action or proceeding with respect thereto,

                (iii) to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with
         the same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as
         if the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and

                (iv)  to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to
         make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;

         provided that the Administrative Agent shall give the Company not less
than ten days' prior written notice of the time and place of any sale or other
intended disposition of any of the Collateral, except any Collateral which is
perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily
sold on a recognized market. The Company agrees that such notice constitutes
"reasonable notification" within the meaning of Section 9-504(3) of the UCC.

         SECTION 7.  Remedies upon Event of Default

         (A) If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent may exercise on behalf of the Secured Parties all rights of
a secured party under the UCC (to the extent permitted by law, whether or not in
effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) and, in addition,
the Administrative Agent may, without being required to give any notice, except
as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (i)
withdraw all cash and Liquid Investments in the Collateral Account and apply
such monies, Liquid Investments and other cash, if any, then held by it as
Collateral as specified in Section 9 and (ii) if there shall be no such monies,
Liquid Investments or cash or if such monies, Liquid Investments or cash shall
be insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations in full, sell the Collateral
or any part thereof at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for
future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Administrative Agent may
deem satisfactory so long as the sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable
manner. The Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser
of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the
Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type
which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any
private sale) and thereafter hold the same, absolutely, free from any right or
claim of whatsoever kind. The Company will execute and deliver such documents
and take such other action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary or
advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law. Upon
any such sale the Administrative

                                       14

<PAGE>

Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser
thereof the Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the
Collateral so sold to it absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever
kind, including any equity or right of redemption of the Company which may be
waived, and the Company, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically
waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which it has or may have
under any law now existing or hereafter adopted. The notice (if any) of such
sale required by Section 6 shall (1) in case of a public sale, state the time
and place fixed for such sale, and (2) in the case of a private sale, state the
day after which such sale may be consummated. Any such public sale shall be held
at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places
as the Administrative Agent may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale
the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as
the Administrative Agent may determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Administrative
Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or
cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to
which the same may be so adjourned. In case of any sale of all or any part of
the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be
retained by the Administrative Agent until the selling price is paid by the
purchaser thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in
case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so
sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon
like notice. The Administrative Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale
herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
foreclose the Security Interests and sell the Collateral, or any portion
thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction.

         (B) For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under
this Agreement the Administrative Agent may (i) require the Company to, and the
Company agrees that it will, at its expense and upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, forthwith assemble all or any part of the Collateral as
directed by the Administrative Agent and make it available at a place designated
by the Administrative Agent which is, in its opinion, reasonably convenient to
the Administrative Agent and the Company, whether at the premises of the Company
or otherwise, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, enter, with or
without process of law and without breach of the peace, any premise where any of
the Collateral is or may be located, and without charge or liability to it seize
and remove such Collateral from such premises, (iii) have access to and use the
Company's books and records relating to the Collateral and (iv) prior to the
disposition of the Collateral, store or transfer it without charge in or by
means of any storage or transportation facility owned or leased by the Company,
process, repair or recondition it or otherwise prepare it for disposition in any
manner and to the extent the Administrative Agent deems appropriate and, in
connection with such preparation and disposition, use without charge any
copyright, trademark, trade name, patent or technical process used by the
Company.

                                       15

<PAGE>

         (C) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing,

                (i) the Administrative Agent may license, or sublicense, whether
         general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or
         non-exclusive basis, any Copyrights, Patents or Trademarks included in
         the Collateral throughout the world for such term or terms, on such
         conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall in its
         sole discretion determine;

                (ii) the Administrative Agent may (without assuming any
         obligations or liability thereunder), at any time and from time to
         time, in its sole discretion, enforce (and shall have the exclusive
         right to enforce) against any licensee or sublicensee all rights and
         remedies of the Company in, to and under any Copyright Licenses, Patent
         Licenses or Trademark Licenses and take or refrain from taking any
         action under any thereof, and the Company hereby releases the
         Administrative Agent and each of the other Secured Parties from, and
         agrees to hold the Administrative Agent and each of the other Secured
         Parties free and harmless from and against any claims and expenses
         arising out of, any lawful action so taken or omitted to be taken with
         respect thereto; and

                (iii) upon request by the Administrative Agent, the Company will
         execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney, in
         form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, for the
         implementation of any lease, assignment, license, sublicense, grant of
         option, sale or other disposition of a Copyright, Patent or Trademark
         or any action related thereto. In the event of any such disposition
         pursuant to this Section, the Company shall supply its know-how and
         expertise relating to the manufacture and sale of the products bearing
         Trademarks or the products or services made or rendered in connection
         with Patents, and its customer lists and other records relating to such
         Patents or Trademarks and to the distribution of said products, to the

         SECTION 8 Limitation on Duty of Administrative Agent in Respect of
Collateral


         Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession
or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income
thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other
rights pertaining thereto. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if
the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it
accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or
damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by
reason of the act or

                                       16

<PAGE>

omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee or other
agent or bailee selected by the Administrative Agent in good faith.

         SECTION 9. Application of Proceeds

         (A) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part
of the Collateral and any cash held in the Collateral Account shall be applied
by the Administrative Agent in the following order of priorities:

                  first, to payment of the expenses of such sale or other
             realization, including reasonable compensation to the
             Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses,
             liabilities and advances incurred or made by the Administrative
             Agent in connection therewith, and any other unreimbursed expenses
             for which the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party is to
             be reimbursed pursuant to Section 12.03 of the Credit Agreement or
             Section 13 hereof and unpaid fees owing to the Administrative Agent
             under the Credit Agreement;

                  second, to the ratable payment of accrued but unpaid interest
             on the Secured Obligations;

                  third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the
             Secured Obligations;

                  fourth, to the ratable payment of all other Secured
             Obligations, until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in
             full; and

                  finally, to payment to the Company or its successors or
             assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any
             surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

         (B) The Administrative Agent may make distributions hereunder in cash
or in kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. The
Administrative Agent shall invest all amounts to be applied to Letter of Credit
Liabilities in Liquid Investments selected by it and hold such amount in trust
for application to future drawings under the Letters of Credit notified to it by
the issuing Lenders in the order in which such drawings are made. If the
Administrative Agent holds any amounts which were distributable in respect of
Letter of Credit Liabilities after the Letters of Credit have expired and all
amounts payable with respect thereto have been paid, such amounts shall be
applied in the order set forth in subsection (A) above.

         (C) In making the determinations and allocations required by this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any of the Lenders
for actions taken in reliance on information supplied by the Lenders as to the
amounts of the

                                       17

<PAGE>

Secured Obligations held by them. All distributions made by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final and the Administrative Agent shall
have no duty to inquire as to the application by the Lenders of any amount
distributed to them. However, if at any time the Administrative Agent determines
that an allocation or distribution previously made pursuant to this Section was
based on a mistake of fact (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, mistakes based on an assumption that principal or interest has been
paid by payments which are subsequently recovered from the recipient thereof
through the operation of any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other
laws or otherwise), the Administrative Agent may in its discretion, but shall
not be obligated to, adjust subsequent allocations and distributions hereunder
so that, on a cumulative basis, the Secured Parties receive the distributions to
which they would have been entitled if such mistake of fact had not been made.

         SECTION 10. Assigned Agreements

         The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers the
Administrative Agent for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, in the
Administrative Agent's sole discretion, if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, to assert, either directly or on behalf of the Company any claims
the Company may have, from time to time, against any other party to the Assigned
Agreements or to otherwise exercise any right or remedy of the Company under the
Assigned Agreements (including, without limitation, the right to enforce
directly against any party to an Assigned Agreement all of the Company's rights
thereunder, to make all demands and give all notices and make all requests
required or permitted to be made by the Company under the Assigned Agreements)
as the Administrative Agent may deem proper. The Company hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and all officers,
employees or agents designated by the Administrative Agent) as the Company's
true and lawful attorney-in-fact for the purpose of enabling the Administrative
Agent, to assert and collect such claims and to exercise such rights and
remedies. The Company shall keep the Administrative Agent informed of all
material circumstances bearing upon the right, title and interest of the Company
under the Assigned Agreements.

         SECTION 11. Concerning the Administrative Agent

         The provisions of Section 11 of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the Administrative Agent in respect of this Agreement and shall be
binding upon the parties to the Credit Agreement in such respect. In furtherance
and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the
Administrative Agent therein set forth:

         (A) The Administrative Agent is authorized to take all such action as
is provided to be taken by it as Administrative Agent hereunder and all other
action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided
for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization
upon the

                                       18

<PAGE>

Collateral) the Administrative Agent shall act or refrain from acting
in accordance with written instructions from the Majority Lenders or, in the
absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion.

     (B) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the existence,
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection,
priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral,
whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to
act on its part hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of
this Agreement by the Company.

     SECTION 12. Appointment of Co-Administrative Agents

     At any time or times, in order to comply with any legal requirement in any
jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent may appoint another bank or trust company
or one or more other persons, either to act as co-agent or co-agents, jointly
with the Administrative Agent, or to act as separate agent or agents on behalf
of the Secured Parties with such power and authority as may be necessary for the
effectual operation of the provisions hereof and may be specified in the
instrument of appointment (which may, in the discretion of the Administrative
Agent, include provisions for the protection of such co-agent or separate agent
similar to the provisions of Section 11).

     SECTION 13. Expenses

     In the event that the Company fails to comply with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement or this Agreement, such that the value of any Collateral or the
validity, perfection, rank or value of any Security Interest is thereby
diminished or potentially diminished or put at risk, the Administrative Agent if
requested by the Majority Lenders may, but shall not be required to, effect such
compliance on behalf of the Company, and the Company shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent for the costs thereof on demand. All insurance expenses and
all expenses of protecting, storing, warehousing, appraising, insuring,
handling, maintaining and shipping the Collateral, any and all excise, property,
sales, and use taxes imposed by any state, federal, or local authority on any of
the Collateral, or in respect of periodic appraisals and inspections of the
Collateral to the extent the same may reasonably be requested by the Majority
Lenders acting through the Administrative Agent from time to time, or in respect
of the sale or other disposition thereof, shall be borne and paid by the
Company; and if the Company fails to promptly pay any portion thereof when due,
except, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, with respect to
taxes which are being contested as permitted by Section 9.02 of the Credit
Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, at its
option, but shall not be required to, pay the same and charge the Company's
account therefor, and the Company agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent
or such Secured Party therefor on demand. All sums so paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured

                                       19

<PAGE>

Party for any of the foregoing and any and all other sums for which the Company
may become liable hereunder and all costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees, legal expenses and court costs) reasonably incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party in enforcing or protecting the Security
Interests or any of their rights or remedies under this Agreement, shall,
together with interest thereon for each day until paid at the Post-Default Rate
for such day, be additional Secured Obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 14. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral

     Upon the repayment in full of all Secured Obligations and the termination
of the Commitments and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the
Security Interests shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert
to the Company. At any time and from time to time prior to such termination of
the Security Interests, the Administrative Agent may release all or any part of
the Collateral with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders; provided that if
any such release would constitute a release of all or substantially all of the
security for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement or under
any Note, such release will require the consent of all the Lenders. Upon any
such termination of the Security Interests or release of Collateral, the
Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Company, execute and deliver to
the Company such documents as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence
the termination of the Security Interests or the release of such Collateral, as
the case may be.

     SECTION 15. Notices

     All notices, approvals, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be given in accordance with Section 12.02 of the Credit
Agreement.

     SECTION 16. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies

     No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right under
the Credit Agreement or this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent of any right
under the Credit Agreement or this Agreement preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights in this
Agreement and the Credit Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
other remedies provided by law.

                                       20

<PAGE>

     SECTION 17. Successors and Assigns

     This Agreement is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties and their successors and assigns, and in the event of an
assignment of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to
the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with
such indebtedness. This Agreement shall be binding on the Company and its
successors and assigns and the rights of the Company hereunder shall inure to
the benefit of the Company's successors and permitted assigns.

     SECTION 18. Changes in Writing

     Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by the Company and
the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders (or, in the
case of Section 14 or this Section, the Lenders).

     SECTION 19.NEW YORK LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY MANDATORY
PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT REMEDIES PROVIDED BY THE LAWS OF
ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW YORK ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH
JURISDICTION. THE COMPANY HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY
NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING
OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT
ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                                       21

     SECTION 20. Severability

     If any provision hereof is invalid and unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
Parties in order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as
may be possible; and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 21. Counterparts

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the
parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

                                   OPINION OF
                            COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

                                    * * * *

         The Security Agreement creates and constitutes as security for the
Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement and including any
future obligations which are Secured Obligations), in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a valid
security interest in all right, title and interest of the Company in the
Collateral and all right, title and interest of the Company in the Collateral
Accounts. The security interests of the Administrative Agent in all right, title
and interest of the Company in the Collateral created by the Security Agreement
constitute perfected security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code, as in
effect in the State of _______ ("UCC"), the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA"), the
United States Copyright Act ("CA"), the United States Patent Act ("PA") and the
United States Trademark Act ("TA"), to the extent that a security interest
therein may be perfected under the UCC, the ICA, the CA, the PA or the TA.
Insofar as the priority thereof is governed by the UCC, the priority of the
security interests created by the Security Agreement in the Collateral in which
the Company has rights on the date hereof will be the same with respect to Loans
made or deemed made or Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement
after the date hereof as with respect to any such Loans made, Letters of Credit
issued or obligations incurred on the date hereof, except to the extent that any
priority may be affected by any security interest, lien or other encumbrance
imposed by law in favor of any government or governmental authority or agency.
Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, each term defined herein has the
meaning assigned to such term in the Security Agreement.

         With respect to the enforceability of the Security Documents, we
express no opinion as to the availability of specific performance. Moreover, our
opinion with respect to the enforceability of the Security Documents is subject
to the further qualification that certain remedial provisions thereof may be
limited by the law of the State of _______ and applicable law of the United
States of America, but such laws do not, in our opinion, make the remedies
afforded thereby inadequate for the practical realization of the benefits of the
security intended to be provided thereby.

obligations of the Company hereunder and under the Credit Agreement:

     (A) The Company hereby assigns and pledges to and with the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and grants to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties security interests in the Pledged
Securities, and all of its rights and privileges with respect thereto, and all
proceeds, income and profits thereon, and all interest, dividends and other
payments and distributions with respect thereto (the "Collateral").
Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, the Company is
delivering the certificates representing the Pledged Instruments and the
certificates representing the Pledged Stock in pledge hereunder.

     (B) In the event that any Issuer at any time issues any additional or
substitute shares of capital stock of any class or any note, or owes any other
Indebtedness to the Company evidenced by an instrument, the Company will
immediately pledge and deposit with the Administrative Agent certificates

                                       3

<PAGE>

representing all such shares and such note or an instrument evidencing such
other Indebtedness as additional security for the Secured Obligations. All such
shares, notes and instruments constitute Pledged Securities and are subject to
all provisions of this Agreement.

     (C) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not
subject the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to, or transfer or
in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in
connection therewith.

     SECTION 4. Delivery of Pledged Securities

     All Pledged Instruments delivered to the Administrative Agent by the
Company pursuant hereto shall be endorsed in suitable form for transfer by
endorsement and delivery by the Administrative Agent, and accompanied by any
required transfer tax stamps, all in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. All certificates representing Pledged Stock delivered to
the Administrative Agent by the Company pursuant hereto shall be in suitable

substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

form as the Administrative Agent may require, execute, deliver, file and record
any financing statement, specific assignment or other paper and take any other
action that the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary or desirable
in order to create, preserve, perfect or validate any Security Interest or to
enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights hereunder

law, the Company hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and file,
in the name of the Company or otherwise, Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements (which may be carbon, photographic or other reproductions of this
Agreement or of a financing statement relating to this Agreement) which the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may deem necessary or appropriate to
further perfect the Security Interests.

     (B) The Company agrees that it will not change (i) its name, identity or
corporate structure in any manner or (ii) the location of its chief executive
office unless it shall have given the Administrative Agent not more than four
months' nor less than 10 days' prior notice thereof.

     SECTION 6. Record Ownership of Pledged Stock.

                                       4

<PAGE>

     The Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time during the
continuance of an Event of Default, in its sole discretion, cause any or all of
the Pledged Stock to be transferred of record into the name of the
Administrative Agent or its nominee. The Company will promptly give to the
Administrative Agent copies of any notices or other communications received by
it with respect to Pledged Stock registered in the name of the Company and the
Administrative Agent will promptly give to the Company copies of any notices and
communications received by the Administrative Agent with respect to Pledged
Stock registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee.

     SECTION 7. Right to Receive Distributions on Collateral.

     The Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive all dividends,
interest and other payments and distributions made upon or with respect to the
Collateral ("Collateral Distributions") other than cash dividends ("Cash
Dividends") and, during the continuance of any Event of Default, to receive Cash
Dividends and to retain all Collateral Distributions, in each case as Collateral
hereunder, and the Company shall take all such action as the Administrative
Agent may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to such right. All
Collateral Distributions which are received by the Company shall be received in
trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties
and, if the Administrative Agent so directs during the continuance of an Event
of Default, shall be segregated from other funds of the Company and shall,
forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent during the continuance of an
Event of Default, be paid over to the Administrative Agent as Collateral in the
same form as received (with any necessary endorsement, without recourse). After
all Events of Default have been cured, the Administrative Agent's right to
retain Collateral Distributions under this Section 7 shall cease.

     SECTION 8. Right to Vote Pledged Stock.

     Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company shall have the right, from time to time, to vote and to give consents,
ratifications and waivers with respect to the Pledged Stock, and the
Administrative Agent shall, upon receiving a written request from the Company
accompanied by a certificate signed by its principal financial officer stating
that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, deliver to the Company
or as specified in such request such proxies, powers of attorney, consents,
ratifications and waivers in respect of any of the Pledged Stock which is
registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee as shall be
specified in such request and be in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

     If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right to the extent permitted by law, and
the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
give effect to such right, to vote and to give consents, ratifications and
waivers, and take any other action with respect to any or all of the Pledged
Stock with the same

                                       5

<PAGE>

force and effect as if the Administrative Agent were the absolute and sole owner
thereof.

     SECTION 9. General Authority

     The Company hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true
and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Company, the Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the
sole use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties,
but at the expense of the Company, to the extent permitted by law to exercise,
at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, all or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the
Collateral:

                (i)   to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance
          for any and all monies due or to become due upon or by virtue thereof,

                (ii)  to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any
          action or proceeding with respect thereto,

                (iii) to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the
          same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if
          the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and

                (iv)  to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to
          make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;

provided that the Administrative Agent shall give the Company not less than ten
days' prior written notice of the time and place of any sale or other intended
disposition of any of the Collateral except any Collateral which threatens to
decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized
market. The Administrative Agent and the Company agree that such notice
constitutes "reasonable notification" within the meaning of Section 9-504(3) of
the Uniform Commercial Code.

     SECTION 10. Remedies upon Event of Default

     If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may exercise on behalf of the Secured Parties all the
rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (to the extent
permitted by law, whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights
are exercised) and, in addition, the Administrative Agent may, without being
required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by
law, (i) apply the cash, if any, then held by it as Collateral as specified in
Section 13 and (ii) if there shall be no such cash or if such cash shall be
insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations in full, sell the Collateral or
any part thereof at public or private sale

                                       6

<PAGE>

or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or
for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Administrative Agent may
deem satisfactory. The Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be
the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if
the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a
type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at
any private sale) and thereafter hold the same, absolutely, free from any right
or claim of whatsoever kind.

     The Administrative Agent is authorized, in connection with any such sale,
if it deems it advisable so to do, (i) to restrict the prospective bidders on or
purchasers of any of the Pledged Securities to a limited number of sophisticated
investors who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own
account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale of any of
such Pledged Securities, (ii) to cause to be placed on any or all of the Pledged
Instruments and on certificates for any or all of the Pledged Stock or on any
other securities pledged hereunder a legend to the effect that such security has
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be disposed of
in violation of the provisions of said Act, and (iii) to impose such other
limitations or conditions in connection with any such sale as the Administrative
Agent deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with said Act or any other
law. The Company covenants and agrees that it will execute and deliver such
documents and take such other action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary
or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law.
Upon any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to deliver,
assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold. Each
purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold absolutely and free
from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of
redemption of the Company which may be waived, and the Company, to the extent
permitted by law, hereby specifically WAIVES all rights of redemption, stay or
appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter
adopted. The notice (if any) of such sale required by Section 9 shall (1) in
case of a public sale, state the time and place fixed for such sale, (2) in case
of sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, state the board or
exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral,
or the portion thereof so being sold, will first be offered for sale at such
board or exchange, and (3) in the case of a private sale, state the day after
which such sale may be consummated. Any such public sale shall be held at such
time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the
Administrative Agent may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale the
Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the
Administrative Agent may determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Administrative
Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or
cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to
which the same may be so adjourned. In case of any sale of all or any part of
the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be

                                       7

<PAGE>

retained by the Administrative Agent until the selling price is paid by the
purchaser thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in
case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so
sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon
like notice. The Administrative Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale
herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
foreclose the Security Interests and sell the Collateral, or any portion
thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 11. Expenses The Company agrees that it will forthwith upon demand
pay to the Administrative Agent:

                 (i)   the amount of any taxes which the Administrative Agent
          may have been required to pay by reason of the Security Interests or
          to free any of the Collateral from any Lien thereon, and

                 (ii)  the amount of any and all out-of-pocket expenses,
          including the fees and disbursements of counsel and of any other
          experts employed to evaluate, protect or realize the value of the
          Collateral, which the Administrative Agent may incur in connection
          with (w) the administration or enforcement of this Agreement,
          including such expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the
          Collateral and the validity, perfection, rank and value of any
          Security Interest, (x) the collection, sale or other disposition of
          any of the Collateral, (y) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of
          any of the rights conferred upon it hereunder or (z) any Default or
          Event of Default.

     Any such amount not paid on demand shall bear interest for each day until
paid at the Post-Default Rate for such day.

     SECTION 12. Limitation on Duty of Administrative Agent in Respect of
Collateral.

     Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession
or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income
thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other
rights pertaining thereto. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in
its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to
that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible
for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the
value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any agent or bailee selected
by the Administrative Agent in good faith.

     SECTION 13. Application of Proceeds

                                       8

<PAGE>

       (A)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part
of the Collateral and any cash held shall be applied by the Administrative Agent
in the following order of priorities:

                 first, to payment of the expenses of such sale or other
            realization, including reasonable compensation to the Administrative
            Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and
            advances incurred or made by the Administrative Agent in connection
            therewith, and any other unreimbursed expenses for which the
            Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party is to be reimbursed
            pursuant to Section 12.03 of the Credit Agreement or Section 11
            hereof and unpaid fees owing to the Administrative Agent under the
            Credit Agreement;

                 second, to the ratable payment of accrued but unpaid interest
            on the Secured Obligations;

                 third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the
            Secured Obligations;

                 fourth, to the ratable payment of all other Secured
            Obligations, until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in
            full; and

                 finally, to payment to the Company or its successors or
            assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any
            surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

       (B)  The Administrative Agent may make distributions hereunder in cash or
in kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. The Administrative
Agent shall invest all amounts to be applied to Letter of Credit Liabilities in
Liquid Investments selected by it and hold such amount in trust for application
to future drawings under the Letters of Credit notified to it by the issuing
Lenders in the order in which such drawings are made. If the Administrative
Agent holds any amounts which were distributable in respect of Letter of Credit
Liabilities after the Letters of Credit have expired and all amounts payable
with respect thereto have been paid, such amounts shall be applied in the order
set forth in subsection (A) above.

       (C)  In making the determinations and allocations required by this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any of the Lenders
for actions taken in reliance on information supplied by the Lenders as to the
amounts of the Secured Obligations held by them. All distributions made by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final and the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by the
Lenders of any amount distributed to them. However, if at any time the
Administrative Agent determines

                                       9

<PAGE>

that an allocation or distribution previously made pursuant to this Section was
based on a mistake of fact (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, mistakes based on an assumption that principal or interest has been
paid by payments which are subsequently recovered from the recipient thereof
through the operation of any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other
laws or otherwise), the Administrative Agent may in its discretion, but shall
not be obligated to, adjust subsequent allocations and distributions hereunder
so that, on a cumulative basis, the Secured Parties receive the distributions to
which they would have been entitled if such mistake of fact had not been made.

       SECTION 14. Concerning the Administrative Agent

       The provisions of Section 11 of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the Administrative Agent in respect of this Agreement and shall be
binding upon the parties to the Credit Agreement in such respect. In furtherance
and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the
Administrative Agent therein set forth:

       (A) The Administrative Agent is authorized to take all such action as is
provided to be taken by it as Administrative Agent hereunder and all other
action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided
for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization
upon the Collateral), the Administrative Agent shall act or refrain from acting
in accordance with written instructions from the Majority Lenders or, in the
absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion.

       (B) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the existence,
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection,
priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral,
whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to
act on its part hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of
this Agreement by the Company.

       SECTION 15. Appointment of Co-Administrative Agents

       At any time or times, in order to comply with any legal requirement in
any jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent may appoint another bank or trust
company or one or more other persons, either to act as co-administrative agent
or co-administrative agents, jointly with the Administrative Agent, or to act as
separate administrative agent or administrative agents on behalf of the Lenders
with such power and authority as may be necessary for the effectual operation of
the provisions hereof and may be specified in the instrument of appointment
(which may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, include provisions
for the protection of such co-administrative agent or separate administrative
agent similar to the provisions of Section 14).

                                       10

<PAGE>

       SECTION 16. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral

       Upon the repayment in full of all Secured Obligations and the termination
of the Commitments and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the
Security Interests shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert
to the Company. At any time and from time to time prior to such termination of
the Security Interests, the Administrative Agent may release all or any part of
the Collateral with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders; provided that if
any such release would constitute a release of all or substantially all of the
security for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement or under
any Note, such release will require the consent of all the Lenders. Upon any
such termination of the Security Interests or release of Collateral, the
Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Company, execute and deliver to
the Company such documents as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence
the termination of the Security Interests or the release of such Collateral, as
the case may be.

       SECTION 17. Notices

       All notices, communications and distributions hereunder shall be given in
accordance with Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement.

       SECTION 18. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies

       No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise by the Administrative Agent of any right under the Credit
Agreement or this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right. The rights in this Agreement and the Credit
Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by
law.

       SECTION 19. Successors and Assigns

       This Agreement is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
other Secured Parties and their successors and assigns, and in the event of an
assignment of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to
the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with
such indebtedness. This Agreement shall be binding on the Company and its
successors and assigns and the rights of the Company hereunder shall inure to
the benefit of the Company's successors and permitted assigns.

       SECTION 20. Changes in Writing

       Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by the Company and

                                       11

<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders (or, in the
case of Section 16 and this Section, the Lenders).

       SECTION 21. NEW YORK LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY
                   TRIAL

       THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY MANDATORY
PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT REMEDIES PROVIDED BY THE LAWS OF
ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW YORK ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH
JURISDICTION. THE COMPANY HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY
NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING
OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT
ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

       SECTION 22. Severability

       If any provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be
possible; and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in
any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

       SECTION 23. Counterparts

       This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the
parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

of The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), as administrative agent (the
"Administrative Agent").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS, Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), certain lenders (the "Lenders") and the Administrative Agent, have
entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of April __, 1994 (as the same may be
amended and in effect from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), providing,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for extensions of credit (by making
loans and issuing letters of credit) to be made by the Lenders to the Company;

     WHEREAS, the Company owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Guarantor;

     WHEREAS, it is a condition to the borrowing of the initial loans under the
Credit Agreement that the Guarantor executes and delivers a Subsidiary Guaranty
whereby the Guarantor shall guarantee the payment when due of all principal,
interest and other amounts that shall be at any time payable by the Company
under the Credit Agreement, the Security Documents; and

     WHEREAS, in order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to
enter into the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor is willing to guarantee the
obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Guarantor agrees as follows:

     SECTION 1. Definitions. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein have, as used herein, the respective meanings provided
for therein.

     SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor represents that:

<PAGE>
          (a)  The Guarantor (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
     incorporation; (ii) has all requisite corporate power, and has all material
     governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to
     own its assets and carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be
     conducted, except in the case of such licenses, authorizations, consents
     and approvals, where the failure to obtain them would not have a material
     adverse effect on its condition (financial or otherwise), assets, nature of
     assets, liabilities (including without limitation, tax, ERISA and
     Environmental Liabilities) or prospects; and (iii) is qualified to do
     business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted
     by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure so to qualify
     would have a material adverse effect on its condition (financial or
     otherwise), assets, nature of assets, liabilities (including, without
     limitation, tax, ERISA and environmental liabilities) or prospects.

          (b)  The Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to
     execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subsidiary
     Guaranty; the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this
     Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
     action; and this Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly and validly executed and
     delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to
     the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
     principles.

          (c)  Neither the execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Basic
     Documents to which it is party nor compliance with the terms and provisions
     thereof by the Guarantor will conflict with or result in a breach of, or
     require any consent under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
     the Guarantor or any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ,
     injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority or agency, or
     any Basic Document or other material agreement or instrument to which the
     Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or
     constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument, or (except for
     the Liens created pursuant to, or permitted by, the Security Documents)
     result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the revenues
     or assets of the Guarantor pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or
     instrument.

          (d)  There are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings by
     or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending
     or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the
     Guarantor in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision
     which could have a material adverse effect on its

                                       2

<PAGE>

     condition (financial or otherwise), assets, nature of assets, liabilities
     (including, without limitation, tax, ERISA and Environmental Liabilities)
     or prospects.

          (e)  The Guarantor has obtained all authorizations, approvals and
     consents of, and has made all filings and registrations with, any
     governmental or regulatory authority or agency and any third party
     necessary for the consummation of the Acquisition and the execution,
     delivery or performance by it of any Basic Document to which it is a party,
     or for the validity or enforceability thereof, except for filing and
     recordings of the Liens created pursuant to, or permitted by, the Security
     Documents.

     SECTION 3. The Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees
the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Note issued by the Company
pursuant to, and each Reimbursement Obligation of the Company under, the Credit
Agreement, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the
Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security Documents. Upon failure by
the Company to pay punctually any such amount, the Guarantor agrees that it
shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the
manner specified in the Credit Agreement or the relevant Security Document, as
the case may be.

     SECTION 4. Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

          (i)    any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
     release in respect of any obligation of the Company under the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document, or any obligation of the
     Guarantor hereunder or under any Security Document, by operation of law or
     otherwise;

          (ii)   any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document;

          (iii)  any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or
     indirect security for any obligation of the Company under the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document or any obligation of the
     Guarantor hereunder or under any Security Document;

          (iv)   any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership
     of the Company, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
     similar proceeding affecting the Company or its assets or any resulting
     release or discharge of any obligation of the Company contained in the
     Credit Agreement, any Note of any Security Document;

                                       3

<PAGE>

          (v)    the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the
     Guarantor may have at any time against the Company, the Administrative
     Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or
     any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the
     assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

          (vi)   any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the
     Company for any reason of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any Security
     Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to
     prohibit the payment by the Company of the principal of or interest on any
     Note or any other amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement
     or any Security Document; or

          (vii)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the
     Company, the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other
     Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the
     provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of
     the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 5. Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full; Reinstatement In Certain
Circumstances. The Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force
and effect until the principal of and interest on the Notes and all other
amounts payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security
Documents shall have been paid in full and the Commitments and Letters of Credit
under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired. If at any time any
payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable
by the Company under the Credit Agreement or any Security Document is rescinded
or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Company or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations
hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such
payment had been due but not made at such time.

     SECTION 6. Waiver by the Guarantor. The Guarantor waives acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any
action be taken by any Person against the Company, the Guarantor hereunder, or
any other Person.

     SECTION 7. Waiver of Subrogation. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
any right or claim of exoneration, reimbursement, subrogation, contribution or
indemnity and any other similar right or claim arising out of any payment by the
Guarantor hereunder.

     SECTION 8. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of
any amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement or any Note is
stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, all
such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit

                                       4

<PAGE>

Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on
demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Majority Lenders.

     SECTION 9.  Limitation on Guarantor's Obligations. The obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance
under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of
comparable state law. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall rank pari
passu.

     SECTION 10. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be given or made by telex, telegraph, telecopy, cable or
other writing and telexed, telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or delivered
to the intended recipient at its address or telex or facsimile transmission
number set forth on the signature page hereof or such other address or telex or
telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to
the Administrative Agent. Except as otherwise provided in this Subsidiary
Guaranty, all such communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when
transmitted by telex or telecopier, delivered to the telegraph or cable office
or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon receipt, in
each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

     SECTION 11. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Subsidiary Guaranty, the
Credit Agreement and the Security Documents shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

     SECTION 12. Successors and Assigns. This Subsidiary Guaranty is for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns and in the event of an assignment of the Loans or other
amounts payable under the Credit Agreement or the Security Documents, the rights
hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be
transferred with such indebtedness. This Subsidiary Guaranty shall be binding
upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns.

     SECTION 13. Changes in Writing. Neither this Subsidiary Guaranty nor any
provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but
only in writing signed by the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Majority Lenders.

     SECTION 14. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY SUBMITS

                                       5

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS
