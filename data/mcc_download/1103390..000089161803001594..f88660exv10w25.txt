of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 2 below, the Lease is hereby

                                       1.

<PAGE>

                  2.3      FURNITURE. On the Closing Date, Tenant shall sell and

                  2.4      SURRENDER OF PREMISES. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the Lease, on the Closing Date, Tenant shall surrender
the Premises in its current condition on the Termination Date.

         3.       FULL RELEASE. Conditioned on satisfaction or waiver of each of
the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 2, each of the parties signing
below on behalf of itself and its employees, officers, directors, agents,
predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and all others
hereby fully releases and discharges the other party and the other party's
employees, officers, directors, agents, predecessors, successors, parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates, and all others from any and all claims and demands of
every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed
and undisclosed, for any damages or other remedy whatsoever, arising out of or
in any way related to the Lease. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
release it gives to the other party upon executing this Agreement applies to all
claims for injuries, damages, or losses to his own person and property, real or
personal (whether those injuries, damages, or losses are known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, patent or latent) which it may have against the other
party. Each party waives application of California Civil Code Section 1542.

         Each party certifies that it has read the following provisions of
California Civil Code Sections 1542:

                  "A general release does not extend to claims which the
                  creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
                  time of executing the release, which if known by him must have
                  materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

and indicates that fact by signing here:
