Section 1.05(a) of the Loan Agreement (as amended by this Amendment).

         5. Section 1.05(b) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting

         of each Loan during such period), June 28, 2002), (ii) on any repayment
         (on the amount repaid), (iii) at maturity (whether by acceleration or

         22. Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, each of the
undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that the execution and delivery by
the Lenders of this Amendment shall not be deemed (i) to create a course of
dealing or otherwise obligate the Lenders to forbear or execute similar
agreements under the same or similar circumstances in the future, (ii) to
modify, relinquish or impair any right of the Lenders to receive any indemnity
or similar payment from any Person or entity as a result of any matter arising
from or relating to this Amendment, (iii) to waive any right of the Lenders to
receive interest at an increased rate as a result of any Events of Default that
may occur under the Loan Agreement, (iv) to obligate the Lenders to make or
agree to make any extension of credit, (v) to obligate the Lenders in any way to
forbear from individually or collectively enforcing remedies under the Loan
Agreement or any other Loan Document in any manner or (vi) a commitment from any
of the Lender to forbear or "stand still". Except as expressly set forth in this
Amendment, no past or future forbearance on the part of any of the Lenders
should be viewed as a limitation upon or waiver of the absolute right and
privilege of the Lenders in exercising rights and remedies that currently exist
or may exist after the Seventh Amendment Effective Date.

         23. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Lenders.

         THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER
SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK.

         24. This Amendment shall become effective on the date (the "Seventh
Amendment Effective Date") when (i) the Borrower and each of the Lenders shall
have signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or different counterparts)
and shall have delivered (including by way of facsimile transmission) the same
to the Lenders at the Notice Office and (ii) the Borrower shall have paid all of
the outstanding legal fees and expenses of White & Case LLP, counsel to the
Lenders.

         25. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Amendment, the
Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (i) no Default or Event of Default
exists as of the Seventh Amendment Effective Date, immediately after giving
effect to this Amendment, and (ii) on the Seventh Amendment Effective Date,
after giving effect to this Amendment, all representations and warranties
contained in the Loan Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are true and
correct in all material respects (it being understood and agreed that any
representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date
shall be true and correct in all material respects only as of such specified
date).

         26. From and after the Seventh Amendment Effective Date, all references
in the Loan Agreement and each of the Loan Documents to the Loan Agreement shall
be deemed to be references to the Loan Agreement as modified hereby.

                                      * * *
