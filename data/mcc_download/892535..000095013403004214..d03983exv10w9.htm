as creating any contract of employment or otherwise conferring upon any
Participant any legal right to continuation of employment, nor as limiting or
qualifying the right of the Company, a Subsidiary or the Manager to discharge
any Employee without regard to the effect that such discharge might have upon
such Employee&#146;s rights under the Plan. Selection for participation in the Plan
shall not entitle any Participant to remain as a Director of the Company, as a

representative of such person, or if there is no duly appointed legal
representative, to the Participant&#146;s spouse or child of majority age, and any
such payments shall be in complete discharge of the liabilities of the Company

the form used generally for other benefit plan purposes) and shall be effective
only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Committee during his or
her lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, cash amounts payable
remaining unpaid or outstanding at the Participant&#146;s death shall be paid to the
Participant&#146;s surviving spouse, if any, or otherwise to his or her estate.
