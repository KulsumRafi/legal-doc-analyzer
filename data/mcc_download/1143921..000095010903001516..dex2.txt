                 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND MERGER

                                 by and between

                                 CENTENNIAL BANK
                                       and
                               CRESCENT STATE BANK
                                       and
                         CRESCENT FINANCIAL CORPORATION

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND MERGER (this "Agreement") is
entered into as of the 12th day of March, 2003 by and between CENTENNIAL BANK, a
North Carolina banking corporation ("Centennial"), CRESCENT STATE BANK, a North
Carolina banking corporation ("Crescent") and CRESCENT FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a
North Carolina corporation and registered bank holding company ("Crescent
Financial");

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed that it is in their mutual best
interests and in the best interests of their respective shareholders for
Centennial to be merged with and into Crescent pursuant to a plan of merger (the
"Plan of Merger") in the form attached hereto as Schedule A, with the effect
that each of the outstanding shares of Centennial's common stock will be
converted into cash and/or newly issued shares of Crescent Financial's common
stock, all in the manner set forth herein, and the parties desire to provide for
certain undertakings, conditions, representations, warranties and covenants in
connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated hereby.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual benefits to be
derived from this Agreement, and of the representations, warranties, conditions,
covenants and promises herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the parties hereto mutually agree as follows:

                              ARTICLE I. THE MERGER

     1.1 Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger, as of the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.12 hereof), Centennial
shall be merged with and into Crescent pursuant to N.C. General Statutes Section
53-12 (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Centennial shall cease
and the corporate existence of Crescent, as the surviving corporation in the
Merger, shall continue under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Crescent,
as the surviving corporation in the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to
as the "Surviving Corporation."

     1.2 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time and by reason of the
Merger, and in accordance with applicable law, all of the property, assets and
rights of every kind and character of Centennial including, without limitation,
all real, personal or mixed property, all debts due on

<PAGE>


whatever account, all other choses in action and every other interest of or
belonging to or due to Centennial, whether tangible or intangible, shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to all
the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of a public
or private nature of Centennial, all without any conveyance, assignment or
further act or deed; and the Surviving Corporation shall become responsible for
all of the liabilities, duties and obligations of every kind, nature and
description of Centennial as of the Effective Time.

     1.3 Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Management. The Articles of
Incorporation and bylaws of Crescent in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable laws. The officers and
directors of Crescent at the Effective Time shall continue to hold such offices
and positions of the Surviving Corporation until removed as provided by law or
until the election or appointment of their respective successors.

     1.4 Conversion of Shares.

          (a) Centennial Stock. Except as otherwise provided herein, at the
Effective Time, all rights of Centennial's shareholders with respect to all then
outstanding shares of the common stock of Centennial, $3.50 par value
("Centennial Stock"), shall cease to exist, and the holders of shares of
Centennial Stock shall cease to be and shall have no further rights as
shareholders of Centennial. At the Effective Time, each such outstanding share
of Centennial Stock (except for shares held, other than in a fiduciary capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted, by Centennial, Crescent or
Crescent Financial, which shall be canceled in the Merger, and for Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 1.9)) shall be converted, without any action on
the part of the holder of such shares, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 1.5) in accordance with this Article I.
Following the Effective Time, certificates representing shares of Centennial
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time shall evidence only the right of the
registered holder thereof to receive, and may be exchanged for, the Merger
Consideration.

          (b) Outstanding Crescent Financial Stock and Crescent Stock. Each
share of common stock of Crescent Financial, par value $1.00 ("Crescent
Financial Stock"), and of Crescent, par value $5.00, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

     1.5 Merger Consideration.

          (a) Per Share Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Article
I, at the Effective Time each outstanding share of Centennial Stock (except for
shares held, other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, by Centennial, Crescent, or Crescent Financial and for
Dissenting Shares) shall cease to represent any interest (equity, shareholder or
otherwise) in Centennial and shall automatically be converted exclusively into
the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, either: (A) cash in
the amount of $10.11 (the "Per Share Amount"), without interest; (B) the
Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 1.5(b) below) of shares of Crescent
Financial Stock; or (C) 50% of the cash amount set forth in clause (A) above and
a number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock equal to 50% of the Exchange

                                       2

<PAGE>

Ratio; provided however, that a holder of Centennial Stock may, pursuant to
Section 1.6, make no election, in which case such share of Centennial Stock held
by such holder shall be converted exclusively into the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 1.6(e) below with respect to Non-Election
Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(b)). The amount of cash into which shares of
Centennial Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Agreement is sometimes
hereinafter referred to as "Cash Consideration," and the number of shares of
Crescent Financial Stock into which shares of Centennial Stock shall be
converted pursuant to this Agreement is sometimes hereinafter referred to as
"Stock Consideration." The Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration are
sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration." No
share of Centennial Stock, other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
1.9), shall be deemed to be outstanding or have any rights other than those set
forth in this Section 1.5(a) after the Effective Time.

          (b) Stock Consideration Exchange Ratio. The exchange ratio of Crescent
Financial Stock for Centennial Stock shall be determined based upon the value of
the Per Share Amount of Centennial Stock and the average of the closing price of
Crescent Financial Stock for the thirty (30) day period ending three (3)
business days immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Exchange Ratio").
The Exchange Ratio is subject to possible adjustment in accordance with Section
1.5(d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if calculation of the Exchange
Ratio results in a ratio less than .8107, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at
.8107. If calculation of the Exchange Ratio results in a ratio more than 1.0965,
the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 1.0965.

          (c) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Centennial Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Crescent Financial Stock (after taking into account all certificates
delivered by such holder under Sections 1.6(c) and 1.8(a) below and the
elections made pursuant to Section 1.6) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
Crescent Financial Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of Crescent
Financial Stock at the Effective Time. The market value of one share of Crescent
Financial Stock at the Effective Time shall be the last sale price of Crescent
Financial Stock on Nasdaq Market, Inc. SmallCap Market ("Nasdaq") as reported by
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative
source selected by Crescent Financial, on the last trading day preceding the
Effective Time. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or
any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.

          (d) Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Crescent Financial changes
the number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, or similar
transaction with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the case
of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock
split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, or
similar transaction for which a record date is not established) shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change.

     1.6 Election and Allocation Procedures.

          (a) An election form (an "Election Form") and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing Centennial Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined) in such form as
Centennial and Crescent Financial shall mutually agree shall be mailed on the
Mailing Date (as defined below) to each shareholder of record of Centennial. The
"Mailing Date" shall be the date on which proxy materials relating to the Merger
are mailed to holders of shares of Centennial Stock.

          (b) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of
Centennial Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary
documentation and instructions) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration
for all of such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii)elect to receive the
Stock Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a "Stock Election"),
(iii)elect to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with clause (C) of the
first sentence of Section 1.5(a) (a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) make no election
or to indicate that such holder has no preference as to the receipt of the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration (a "Non-Election"). Shareholders of
record of Centennial who hold shares of Centennial Stock as nominees, trustees
or in other representative capacities may submit multiple Election Forms,
provided that such representative certifies that each such Election Form covers
all the shares of Centennial Stock held by that representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election shall have been made are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares."
Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Stock Election shall have
been made are referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of
Centennial Stock with respect to which no election shall have been made are
referred to herein as "Non-Election Shares." The aggregate number of shares of
Centennial Stock with respect to which a Stock Election shall have been made is
referred to herein as the "Stock Election Number." Shares of Centennial Stock
with respect to which a Mixed Election shall have been made shall not be deemed
either Stock Election Shares or Cash Election Shares, but shall in all events be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as specified in
subsection (e) of this Section 1.6.

          (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m. North Carolina time on
the last business day prior to the date of the Centennial shareholders' meeting
contemplated by Section 4.3(a) (or such other time and date as Centennial,
Crescent and Crescent Financial may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline").
An election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline.
An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one
or more certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Crescent
Financial pursuant to Section 1.8(b), indemnification regarding the loss or
destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
certificates) representing all shares of Centennial Stock covered by such
Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included with
the Election Form. Any Centennial shareholder may at any time prior to the
Election Deadline change his or her election

                                       4

<PAGE>

by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form. Any
Centennial shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke
his or her election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates,
previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All elections shall be revoked
automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Crescent
Financial, Crescent and Centennial that this Agreement has been terminated. If a
Centennial shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline, or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Centennial Stock held by such shareholder shall
be designated Non-Election Shares. Crescent Financial shall cause the
certificates representing Centennial Stock described in clause (ii) above to be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from the person who submitted the Election Form.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.

          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
50% (the "Stock Conversion Number") of the total number of shares of Centennial
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time to be converted into Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a), excluding such shares as may be
subject to an effective Mixed Election (the "Adjustable Conversion Shares"),
shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and the remaining Adjustable
Conversion Shares shall be converted into Cash Consideration (excluding shares
of Centennial Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 1.4(a) and Dissenting
Shares); provided, however, that for federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and in
order that the Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest
requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to
reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, as reasonably determined by
counsel to Crescent Financial, Crescent Financial shall increase the number of
Adjustable Conversion Shares that will be converted into the Stock Consideration
and reduce the number of Adjustable Conversion Shares that will be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

          (e) Within five business days after the later to occur of the Election
Deadline or the Effective Time, Crescent Financial shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Centennial Stock of rights to
receive the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration as follows:

               (i) In any event, all shares of Centennial Stock with respect to
          which a Mixed Election shall have been made shall be converted into
          50% of the amount of cash set forth in clause (A) of the first
          sentence of Section 1.5(a) and a number of shares of Crescent
          Financial Stock equal to 50% of the Exchange Ratio;

               (ii) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion
          Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares
          shall be

                                       5

<PAGE>

          converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each
          holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock
          Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal
          to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock
          Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator
          of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which
          is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such
          holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
          receive the Cash Consideration; and

               (iii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
          Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
          exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
          "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted
          into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election
          Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following
          manner:

                    (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
               number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares
               shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
               Consideration and each holder of Non-Election Shares shall
               receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of
               Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
               (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
               a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and
               the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election
               Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election
               Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
               Consideration; or

                    (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
               Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be
               converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and
               each holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock
               Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares
               equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
               Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
               numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall
               Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
               the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election
               Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election
               Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
               Consideration.

For purposes of this Section 1.6(e), if Crescent Financial is obligated to
increase the number of Adjustable Conversion Shares to be converted into shares
of Crescent Financial Stock as a result of the application of the last clause of
Section 1.6(d) above, then the higher number shall be the Stock Conversion
Number in the calculations set forth in this Section 1.6(e).

     1.7 Closing Payment. As of the Effective Time, Crescent Financial shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with First-Citizens Bank and Trust
Company, transfer agent of Crescent Financial Stock (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the benefit of each holder of Centennial Stock for exchange in accordance with
this Article I, (i) certificates representing the aggregate

                                       6

<PAGE>

number of whole shares of Crescent Financial Stock to be issued as Stock
Consideration, and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash to be delivered to holders
of Centennial Stock as Cash Consideration and in lieu of any fractional shares,
to be issued and paid pursuant to this Article I for outstanding shares of
Centennial Stock (such certificates for shares of Crescent Financial Stock and
such cash are referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions in accordance with this Article I, deliver
the Crescent Financial Stock and cash contemplated to be issued with respect to
Centennial Stock out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Crescent Financial, on a daily basis. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Crescent
Financial.

     1.8 Exchange of Shares.

          (a) Exchange Procedures. After the Effective Time, Crescent Financial
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the shareholders of Centennial of
record at the Effective Time who did not previously submit a completed Election
Form transmittal materials and other appropriate written instructions
(collectively, a "Transmittal Letter") (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate representing shares
of Centennial Stock prior to such Effective Time shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Crescent Financial may reasonably
specify). After the Effective Time and upon the proper surrender of
certificate(s) representing shares of Centennial Stock to the Exchange Agent,
together with a properly completed and duly executed Transmittal Letter or, as
applicable, Election Form, the holder of such certificate(s) shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock
and the cash to which such holder is entitled hereunder (including any cash
payments to which such holder is entitled hereunder in respect of rights to
receive fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(c)), subject to any required
withholding of applicable taxes. Neither Crescent Financial nor the Exchange
Agent shall be obligated to deliver any of such payments in cash or stock until
such holder surrenders the certificate(s) representing such holder's shares. The
certificate(s) so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
require. If there is a transfer of ownership of any shares of Centennial Stock
not registered in the transfer records of Centennial, the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the certificates representing such
Centennial Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Crescent Financial and the
Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of certificates representing
Centennial Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Crescent Financial, upon demand, and any shareholders of Centennial who have not
previously complied with the provisions of this Article I shall thereafter look
only to Crescent Financial for payment of their claim for Crescent Financial
Stock and/or cash and any dividends or distributions with respect to Crescent
Financial Stock. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Centennial Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such portion would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of

                                       7

<PAGE>

Crescent Financial free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled therein. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither Crescent Financial nor the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Centennial Stock for any amounts paid or
properly delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law.

          (b) Lost Certificates. Any shareholder of Centennial whose certificate
representing shares of Centennial Stock has been lost, destroyed, stolen or
otherwise is missing shall be entitled to receive a certificate representing the
shares of Crescent Financial Stock and/or any cash, including cash in lieu of
fractional shares, to which he or she is entitled in accordance with and upon
compliance with conditions reasonably imposed by the Exchange Agent or Crescent
Financial (including, without limitation, a requirement that the shareholder
provide a lost instruments indemnity bond in form, substance and amount
reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Crescent Financial).

          (c) Rights of Former Centennial Shareholders. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Centennial shall be closed as to holders of
Centennial Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of
Centennial Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized.
Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section
1.8(a) of this Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of
Centennial Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.4(a) of
this Agreement and Dissenting Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing Centennial Stock are
presented to Centennial, Crescent Financial or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. To
the extent permitted by North Carolina law, former shareholders of record of
Centennial shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
shareholders of Crescent Financial the number of whole shares of Crescent
Financial Stock into which their respective shares of Centennial Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their certificates
representing Centennial Stock for certificates representing Crescent Financial
Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Crescent Financial on the Crescent
Financial Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of
Crescent Financial Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger, but beginning at
the Effective Time no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of
record of Crescent Financial Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the holder of any certificate representing shares of
Centennial Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder
surrenders such certificate for exchange as provided in Section 1.8(a) of this
Agreement; provided, however, that upon surrender of such Centennial Stock
certificate (or compliance with Section 1.8(b) of this Agreement), the Crescent
Financial Stock certificate, together with all undelivered dividends or other
distributions (without interest) and any cash payments to be paid for fractional
share interests (without interest), shall be delivered and paid with respect to
each share represented by such Centennial Stock certificate.

     1.9 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Centennial Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by shareholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented

                                       8

<PAGE>

thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders
instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the North
Carolina Business Corporation Act, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under
Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 1.8 of the
certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
evidenced such shares. Centennial shall give Crescent Financial (i)prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Centennial Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands for appraisal or any other instruments
served pursuant to Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act and
received by Centennial relating to shareholders' rights of appraisal, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands under Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act
consistent with the obligations of Centennial thereunder. Centennial shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Crescent Financial, (x) make any
payment with respect to such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand
for appraisal, or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with Article 13 of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act.

     1.10 Treatment of Centennial Stock Options.

          (a) At the Effective Time, Crescent Financial shall assume each option
to purchase Centennial Stock granted and outstanding under the Centennial Bank
2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Centennial Bank 2000 Nonstatutory Stock
Option Plan (collectively, the "Centennial Option Plans"), whether or not then
exercisable, in accordance with the terms of the Centennial Option Plans and
stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time with respect to each such plan or agreement: (i) Crescent

     2.6 Validity of Transactions; Absence of Required Consents or Waivers.
Provided the required approvals of Centennial's shareholders and of governmental
or regulatory authorities are obtained, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions described herein, nor
compliance by Centennial with any of its obligations or agreements contained
herein, will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of the terms and
conditions of, or constitute a default or violation under any provision of, the

or the performance of its obligations or agreements or the consummation of the
transactions described herein, except for required approvals of Centennial's
shareholders as described in Section 7.1(a) below and of governmental or

     2.7 Books and Records. The books of account of Centennial have been

material respects with all the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or

caused to be filed, or obtained proper extensions of time for filing, all

Statements, or (ii) obligations or liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of its business since December 31, 2002 and which are not, individually or in
the aggregate, material to Centennial. No facts or circumstances exist that
could reasonably be expected to serve as the basis for any other liabilities of
Centennial.

     2.13 Litigation and Compliance with Law.

          (a) There are no actions, suits, arbitrations, controversies or other
proceedings or investigations (or, to the best knowledge and belief of
management of Centennial, any facts or circumstances which reasonably could
result in such), including, without limitation, any such action by any
governmental or regulatory authority, which currently exist or are ongoing,
pending or, to the best knowledge and belief of management of Centennial,
threatened, contemplated or probable of assertion, against, relating to or
otherwise affecting Centennial, or any of their respective properties, assets or
employees which, if determined adversely, could result in liability on the part
of Centennial for, or subject Centennial to, material monetary damages, fines or
penalties or an injunction, or which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
Centennial or on Centennial's ability to consummate the Merger.

          (b) Except for such licenses, permits, orders, authorizations or
approvals ("Permits") the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Centennial, Centennial has all Permits of any federal, state, local or
foreign governmental or regulatory body that are material to or necessary for
the conduct of its respective business or to own, lease and operate its
respective properties. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Centennial, all such Permits are in full force and effect and no violations are
or have been recorded in respect of any such Permits. No proceeding is pending
or, to the best knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, threatened or
probable of assertion to suspend, cancel, revoke or limit any Permit.

          (c) Centennial is not subject to any supervisory agreement,
enforcement order, writ, injunction, capital directive, supervisory directive,
memorandum of understanding or other similar agreement, order, directive,
memorandum or consent of, with or issued by any regulatory or other governmental
authority (including, without limitation, the Commissioner, or the FDIC)
relating to its financial condition, directors or officers, employees,
operations, capital, regulatory compliance or otherwise; there are no judgments,
orders, stipulations, injunctions, decrees or awards against Centennial that in
any manner limit, restrict, regulate, enjoin or prohibit any present or past

<PAGE>

advised or has any reason to believe that any regulatory or other governmental
authority or any court is contemplating, threatening or requesting the issuance
of any such agreement, order, injunction, directive, memorandum, judgment,
stipulation, decree or award.

          (d) Centennial is not in violation or default under, and each has
complied with, all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders,
writs, injunctions or decrees of any court or federal, state, municipal or other
governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction or authority over it or
its business operations, properties or assets (including, without limitation,
all provisions of North Carolina law relating to usury, the Consumer Credit
Protection Act, and all other laws and regulations applicable to extensions of
credit) except for any such violation, default or noncompliance as does not or
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Centennial, and, to the best
knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, there is no basis for any
claim by any person or authority for compensation, reimbursement or damages or
otherwise for any violation of any of the foregoing.

     2.14 Real Properties. Centennial has Previously Disclosed to Crescent
Financial a listing of all real property owned or leased by Centennial (the
"Real Property") and all leases pertaining to any such Real Property to which
Centennial is a party (the "Real Property Leases"). With respect to all Real
Property, Centennial has good and marketable fee simple title to, or a valid and
subsisting leasehold interest in, such Real Property and owns the same free and
clear of all mortgages, liens, leases, encumbrances, title defects and
exceptions to title other than (i) the lien of current taxes not yet due and
payable, and (ii) such imperfections of title and restrictions, covenants and
easements (including utility easements) which do not materially affect the value
of the Real Property and which do not and will not materially detract from,
interfere with or restrict the present or future use of the properties subject
thereto or affected thereby. With respect to each Real Property Lease (i) such
lease is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms, (ii) there
currently exists no circumstance or condition which constitutes an event of
default by Centennial (as lessor or lessee) or its respective lessor or which,
with the passage of time or the giving of required notices will or could
constitute such an event of default, and (iii) subject to any required consent
of Centennial's lessor, each such Real Property Lease may be assigned to
Crescent Financial and the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not
constitute an event of default thereunder. To the best knowledge and belief of
management of Centennial, the Real Property complies with all applicable
federal, state and local laws, regulations, ordinances or orders of any
governmental authority, including those relating to zoning, building and use
permits, except for such noncompliance as does not or would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Centennial, and the Real Property may be used under applicable
zoning ordinances for commercial banking facilities as a matter of right rather
than as a conditional or nonconforming use. All improvements and fixtures
included in or on the Real Property are in good condition and repair, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and there does not exist any condition which materially
adversely affects the economic value thereof or materially adversely interferes
(or will interfere after the Merger) with the contemplated use thereof.

     2.15 Loans, Accounts, Notes and Other Receivables.

          (a) All loans, accounts, notes and other receivables reflected as
assets on the books and records of Centennial (i) have resulted from bona fide
business transactions in the ordinary course of operations of Centennial, (ii)
were made in accordance with the standard loan

                                       16

<PAGE>

policies and procedures of Centennial, and (iii) are owned by Centennial free
and clear of all liens, encumbrances, assignments, participation or repurchase
agreements or other exceptions to title or to the ownership or collection rights
of any other person or entity.

          (b) All of the records of Centennial regarding all outstanding loans,
accounts, notes and other receivables, and all other real estate owned, are
accurate in all material respects, and, with respect to such loans the loan
documentation of which indicate are secured by any real or personal property or
property rights ("Loan Collateral"), such loans are in all material respects
secured by valid, perfected and enforceable liens on all such Loan Collateral
having the priority described in the records of such loan. Centennial has not
engaged in any form of indirect lending and no such indirect loans are
outstanding.

          (c) To the best knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, each
loan reflected as an asset on the books of Centennial and each guaranty
therefor, is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor or guarantor
thereon, and no defense, offset or counterclaim has been asserted with respect
to any such loan or guaranty.

          (d) Centennial has previously delivered to Crescent Financial (i) a
written listing of each loan, extension of credit or other asset of Centennial
which, as of December 31, 2002, is classified by the FDIC or the Commissioner as
"Loss," "Doubtful," "Substandard" or "Special Mention" (or otherwise by words of
similar import), or which it has designated as a special asset or for special
handling or placed on any "watch list" because of concerns regarding the
ultimate collectibility or deteriorating condition of such asset or any obligor
or Loan Collateral therefor, and (ii) a written listing of each loan or
extension of credit that, as of December 31, 2002, was past due as to the
payment of principal or interest or both, or as to which any obligor thereon
(including the borrower or any guarantor) otherwise was in default, is the
subject of a proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise has indicated any inability
or intention not to repay such loan or extension of credit. Each such listing is
accurate and complete in all material respects as of the date indicated.

          (e) As of December 31, 2002, Centennial's, reserve for possible loan
losses (the "Loan Loss Reserve") has been established in conformity with GAAP,
sound banking practices and all applicable requirements, rules and policies of
the FDIC and the Commissioner and, in the best judgment of management of
Centennial, is reasonable in view of the size and character of its loan
portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors, and is
adequate to provide for losses relating to or the risk of loss inherent in its
loan portfolio.

     2.16 Securities Portfolio and Investments. All securities owned by
Centennial (whether owned of record or beneficially) are held free and clear of
all mortgages, liens, pledges, encumbrances or any other restriction or rights
of any other person or entity, whether contractual or statutory, which would
materially impair the ability of Centennial to dispose freely of any such
security or otherwise to realize the benefits of ownership thereof at any time.
There are no voting trusts or other agreements or undertakings to which
Centennial is a party with respect to the voting of any such securities. With
respect to all "repurchase agreements" to which Centennial has "purchased"
securities under agreement to resell, Centennial has a valid, perfected first
lien or security interest in the government securities or other collateral
securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each
such repurchase

                                       17

<PAGE>

agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt owed that is secured by such
collateral. Except for fluctuations in the market values of its investment
securities, since December 31, 2002, there has been no significant deterioration
or material adverse change in the quality, or any material decrease in the
value, of Centennial's securities portfolio as a whole.

     2.17 Personal Property and Other Assets. All tangible personal property of
Centennial material to the business operations of Centennial (including, without
limitation, all banking equipment, data processing equipment, vehicles, and all
other tangible personal property located in any office of or used by Centennial
in the operation of its business) is owned or leased by Centennial free and
clear of all liens, encumbrances, leases, title defects or exceptions to title
other than such as are not material in character, amount or extent, and which do
not materially detract from the value of, or interfere with the present or
future use or ability to convey, the property subject thereto or affected
thereby. All of Centennial's tangible personal property material to its business
is in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

     2.18 Patents and Trademarks. Centennial owns, possesses or has the right to
use any and all patents, licenses, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade
secrets and proprietary and other confidential information necessary to conduct
its business as now conducted; and Centennial has not violated, and currently is
not in conflict with, any patent, license, trademark, trade name, copyright or
proprietary right of any other person or entity.

     2.19 Environmental Matters.

          (a) Centennial has Previously Disclosed to Crescent Financial copies
of all written reports, correspondence, notices or other materials, if any, in
its possession pertaining to environmental surveys or assessments of the Real

below) by any person prior to the date hereof on, from or relating to the Real
Property or, to the best knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, the
Loan Collateral, which constitutes a violation of any Environmental Laws.

          (c) Centennial has not violated any federal, state or local law, rule,
regulation, order, permit or other requirement relating to health, safety or the
environment or imposing liability, responsibility or standards of conduct
applicable to environmental conditions, and there has been no violation of any
Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 2.19(f) below) (including, to the best
knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, any violation with respect to
or relating to any Loan Collateral) by any other person or entity for whose

other employee benefit plans, contracts, or arrangements maintained or
contributed to by Centennial for the benefit of any employees, former employees,

"Plans"). True and complete copies of all Plans, including, but not limited to,
any trust instruments or insurance contracts, if any, forming a part thereof,
and all amendments thereto, previously have been supplied to Crescent Financial.
Centennial does not maintain, sponsor, contribute to or otherwise participate in
any "Employee Benefit Plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), any "Multiemployer
Plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or any "Multiple Employer
Welfare Arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Each Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
has received or applied for a favorable determination letter from the IRS and
Centennial is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in the
revocation or denial of any such favorable determination letter. All reports and
returns with respect to the Plans (and any Plans previously maintained by
Centennial) required to be filed with any governmental department, agency,
service or other authority, including, without limitation, Internal Revenue
Service Form 5500 (Annual Report), have been properly and timely filed.

          (b) All "Employee Benefit Plans" maintained by or otherwise covering
employees or former employees of Centennial currently are, and at all times have
been, in compliance with all provisions and requirements of ERISA except those
the noncompliance of which, when taken as a whole, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Centennial. There is

                                       21

<PAGE>

no pending or, to Centennial's best knowledge, threatened litigation relating to
any Plan or any such Plan previously maintained by Centennial. Centennial has
not engaged in a transaction with respect to any Plan that has subjected it, or
absent the exemption under which the transaction was effected, would subject it
to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA.

          (c) Centennial has delivered to Crescent Financial a true, correct and
complete copy (including copies of all amendments thereto) of each of its
retirement plans that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (collectively, the "Retirement Plans"), together with true, correct and
complete copies of the summary plan descriptions relating to the Retirement
Plans, the most recent determination letters received from the IRS regarding the
Retirement Plans, and the most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 series) and
related schedules, if any, for the Retirement Plans. The Retirement Plans are
qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code, the trusts under
the Retirement Plans are exempt trusts under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
determination letters have been issued or applied for with respect to the
Retirement Plans to said effect, including determination letters covering the
current terms and provisions of the Retirement Plans. There are no issues
relating to said qualification or exemption of the Retirement Plans currently
pending before the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any court. The Retirement Plans and the
administration thereof meet (and have met since the establishment of the
Retirement Plans) the requirements of ERISA, the Code and all other laws, rules
and regulations applicable to the Retirement Plans and do not violate (and since
the establishment of the Retirement Plans have not violated) any of the
provisions of ERISA, the Code and such other laws, rules and regulations, except
to the extent such violation, when taken as a whole, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Centennial. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
all reports and returns with respect to the Retirement Plans required to be
filed with any governmental department, agency, service or other authority have
been properly and timely filed. There are no disputes or unresolved
disagreements with respect to the Retirement Plans or the administration thereof
currently existing between Centennial, or any trustee or other fiduciary
thereunder, and any governmental agency, any current or former employee of
Centennial, or beneficiary of any such employee or any other person or entity.
No "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043(b) of ERISA has
occurred at any time with respect to the Retirement Plans, other than those,
when taken as a whole, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Centennial.

          (d) No liability under subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by Centennial with respect to the Retirement Plans
or with respect to any other ongoing, frozen or terminated defined benefit
pension plan currently or formerly maintained by Centennial. Centennial
presently does not contribute to a "Multiemployer Plan" or has ever contributed
to such a plan. All contributions required to be made pursuant to the terms of
each of the Plans (including without limitation the Retirement Plans and any
other "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, provided such plan is
intended to qualify under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code)
maintained by Centennial have been timely made. Neither the Retirement Plans nor
any other "pension plan" maintained by Centennial have an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. Centennial has not provided, and is not required
to provide, security to any "pension plan" or to any "Single Employer Plan"
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29)

                                       22

<PAGE>

of the Code. Under the Retirement Plans and any other "pension plan" maintained
by Centennial as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the
date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined
on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the plan's most recent
actuarial valuation) did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
plan, and there has been no material change in the financial condition of any
such plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

          (e) There are no restrictions on the rights of Centennial to amend or
terminate any Plan. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (except as otherwise
specifically provided for or contemplated by the transactions described in this
Agreement) (i) result in any payment to any person (including, without
limitation, any severance compensation or payment, unemployment compensation,
"golden parachute" or "change in control" payment, or otherwise) becoming due
under any plan or agreement to any director, officer, employee or consultant,
(ii)increase any benefits otherwise payable under any plan or agreement, or
(iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefit.

     2.24 Insurance. Centennial has in effect a "financial institutions bond"
and such other policies of general liability, casualty, directors and officers
liability, employee fidelity, errors and omissions and other property and
liability insurance as have been Previously Disclosed to Crescent Financial (the
"Policies"). The Policies provide coverage in such amounts and against such
liabilities, casualties, losses or risks as is required by applicable law or
regulation; and, in the judgment of management of Centennial, the insurance
coverage provided under the Policies is reasonable and adequate in all respects
for Centennial. Each of the Policies is in full force and effect and is valid
and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is underwritten by an insurer
of recognized financial responsibility that is qualified to transact business in
North Carolina; and Centennial has taken all requisite actions (including the
giving of required notices) under each such Policy to preserve all rights
thereunder with respect to all matters. Centennial is not in default under the
provisions of, has received notice of cancellation or nonrenewal of or any
premium increase on, or has any knowledge of any failure to pay any premium on

occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to result in any such claim.

defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable regulations
thereunder. The deposits of each depositor in Centennial are insured by the FDIC
to the maximum amount provided by law, all deposit insurance premiums due from
Centennial to the FDIC have been paid in full in a timely fashion, and, to the
best knowledge and belief of Centennial, no proceedings have been commenced or
are contemplated by the FDIC or otherwise to terminate such insurance.

the name and current salary or wage rate for each present employee of

Affiliates of Centennial.

     2.28 Obstacles to Regulatory Approval or Tax Treatment. To the best
knowledge and belief of management of Centennial, there exists no fact or
condition relating to Centennial that may reasonably be expected to (i) prevent,
impede or delay Crescent Financial or Centennial from obtaining the regulatory

pending or, to the best knowledge and belief of management of Crescent

respective properties, assets or employees which, if determined adversely, could
result in liability on the part of Crescent Financial or Crescent for, or

penalties or an injunction, or which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
Crescent Financial and Crescent or on Crescent Financial's ability to consummate
the Merger.

Effect on Crescent Financial or Crescent, each of Crescent Financial and
Crescent has all Permits of any federal, state, local or foreign governmental or

respective business or to own, lease and operate its respective properties.

governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction or authority over it or
its business operations, properties or assets (including without limitation all
provisions of North Carolina law relating to usury, the Consumer Credit
Protection Act, and all other laws and regulations applicable to extensions of
credit) except for any such violation, default or noncompliance as does not or
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Crescent Financial and Crescent,
and, to the best knowledge and belief of management of Crescent Financial, there
is no basis for any claim by any person or authority for compensation,
reimbursement or damages or otherwise for any violation of any of the foregoing.

     3.14 Obstacles to Regulatory Approval or Tax Treatment. To the best of the
knowledge and belief of the management of Crescent Financial, no fact or
condition relating to Crescent Financial exists that may reasonably be expected
to (i) prevent, impede or delay Crescent Financial or Centennial from obtaining
the regulatory approvals required in order to consummate transactions described
herein, or (ii) prevent the Merger from qualifying to be a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code; and, if any such fact or
condition becomes known to the executive officers of Crescent Financial,
Crescent Financial promptly (and in any event within three days after obtaining
such knowledge) shall communicate such fact or condition to the President of
Centennial.

     3.15 Loans, Accounts, Notes and Other Receivables.

and (iii)are owned by Crescent Financial or Crescent free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, assignments, participation or repurchase agreements or

person or entity.

          (b) All of the records of Crescent Financial and Crescent regarding
all outstanding loans, accounts, notes and other receivables, and all other real
estate owned, are accurate in all material respects, and, with respect to such

<PAGE>

          (c) To the best knowledge and belief of management of Crescent
Financial, each loan reflected as an asset on the books of Crescent Financial
and Crescent and each guaranty therefor, is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor or guarantor thereon, and no defense, offset or
counterclaim has been asserted with respect to any such loan or guaranty.

Financial or Crescent (whether owned of record or beneficially) are held free
and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, encumbrances or any other
restriction or rights of any other person or entity, whether contractual or
statutory, which would materially impair the ability of Crescent Financial or
Crescent to dispose freely of any such security or otherwise to realize the
benefits of ownership thereof at any time. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or undertakings to which Crescent Financial or Crescent is a party
with respect to the voting of any such securities. With respect to all
"repurchase agreements" to which Crescent Financial or Crescent has "purchased"
securities under agreement to resell, Crescent Financial or Crescent has a
valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the government securities or
other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of the
collateral securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the amount
of the debt owed that is secured by such collateral. Except for fluctuations in
the market values of its investment securities, since December 31, 2002, there
has been no significant deterioration or material adverse change in the quality,
or any material decrease in the value, of Crescent Financial's securities
portfolio as a whole.

statements contained herein), when considered as a whole, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements herein or therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each

     5.5 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

          (a) After the Effective Time, without releasing any insurance carrier
and after exhaustion of all applicable director and liability insurance coverage
for Centennial and its directors and officers, Crescent Financial shall
indemnify, hold harmless and defend the directors and officers of Centennial in
office on the date hereof or the Effective Time, to the same extent as it
indemnifies its own directors and officers, from and against any and all claims,
disputes, demands, causes of action, suits, proceedings, losses, damages,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses of every kind and nature including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs and expenses
therewith whether known or unknown and whether now existing or hereafter arising
which may be threatened against, incurred, undertaken, received or paid by such
persons in connection with or which arise out of or result from or are based
upon any action or failure to act by such person in the ordinary scope of his
duties as a director or officer of Centennial (including service as a fiduciary
of any of the Centennial Plans (as defined in Section 2.23(a)) through the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Crescent Financial shall not be
obligated to indemnify such person for (i) any act not available for statutory
or permissible indemnification under North Carolina law, (ii) any penalty,
decree, order, finding or other action imposed or taken by any regulatory
authority, (iii) any violation or alleged violation of federal or state
securities laws to the extent that indemnification is prohibited by law, or (iv)
any claim of sexual or other unlawful harassment, or any form of employment
discrimination prohibited by federal or state law; further, provided, however,
that (A) Crescent Financial shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and upon such assumption Crescent Financial shall not be liable to any director
or officer of Centennial for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such director or officer in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Crescent Financial elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for such director or officer reasonably advises such director
or officer that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Crescent Financial and such director or officer, such director or officer may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to him, and Crescent Financial shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, (B) Crescent Financial shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, and
(C) Crescent Financial shall have no obligation hereunder to any director or
officer of Centennial when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of such director or officer in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. The indemnification
provided herein shall be in addition to any indemnification rights an indemnitee
may have by law, pursuant to the charter or bylaws of Centennial or pursuant to
any Plan for which the indemnity serves as a fiduciary.

          (b) From and after the Effective Time, Crescent Financial will
directly or indirectly cause the persons who served as directors or officers of
Centennial at the Effective Time to be covered by Centennial's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided that Crescent
Financial may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage in
amounts contained and terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than
such policy). Such insurance coverage shall commence at the Effective Time and
will be provided for a period of no less than three years after the Effective
Time.

          (c) The indemnification provided by this Section 5.5 is the sole
indemnification provided by Crescent Financial to the directors and officers of
Centennial for

                                       40

<PAGE>

service in such positions up to and through the Effective Time. This Section 5.5
is intended to create personal rights in the directors and officers of
Centennial, who shall be deemed to be third-party beneficiaries hereof.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
the indemnification rights provided herein shall not be extinguished but shall
instead survive for a period of three years after the Effective Time.

     5.6 Notice of Certain Changes or Events. Following the execution of this
Agreement and up to the Effective Time, Crescent Financial promptly will notify
Centennial in writing of and provide to it such information as it shall request
regarding (i) any material adverse change in its consolidated financial
condition, consolidated results of operations, prospects, business, assets, loan
portfolio, investments, properties or operations, or of the actual or
prospective occurrence of any condition or event which, with the lapse of time
or otherwise, may or could cause, create or result in any such material adverse
change, or (ii) the actual or prospective existence or occurrence of any
condition or event which, with the lapse of time or otherwise, has caused or may
or could cause any statement, representation or warranty of Crescent Financial
herein to be or become inaccurate, misleading or incomplete, or which has
resulted or may or could cause, create or result in the breach or violation of
any of Crescent Financial's covenants or agreements contained herein or in the
failure of any of the conditions described in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 below.

     5.7 Further Action; Instruments of Transfer. Crescent Financial shall (i)
use its best efforts in good faith to take or cause to be taken all action
required of it hereunder as promptly as practicable so as to permit the
expeditious consummation of the transactions described herein, (ii) perform all
acts and execute and deliver to Centennial all documents or instruments required
herein or as otherwise shall be reasonably necessary or useful to or requested
of Crescent Financial in consummating such transactions and (iii) cooperate with
Centennial fully in carrying out, and will pursue diligently the expeditious
completion of, such transactions.

of its shareholders to be duly called and held as soon as practicable following
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of voting on

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

     6.2 Regulatory Approvals. Within 75 days after the date of this Agreement,
each of Crescent Financial and Centennial shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all applications for regulatory approvals and actions as may
be required of it, by applicable law and regulations with respect to the
transactions described herein (including applications to the FDIC, the
Commissioner and to any other applicable federal or state banking, securities or
other regulatory authority). Each party shall use its best efforts in good faith
to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals required for consummation of the
transactions described herein. Each party shall cooperate with the other party
in the preparation of all applications to regulatory authorities and, upon
request, promptly shall furnish all documents, information, financial statements
or other material that may be required by any other party to complete any such

have the right to review and comment on the form and content of any such

officers, directors, employees or counsel of any of the parties hereto be
requested by any other party or by any governmental agency at any hearing in
connection with any such application, such party shall promptly use its best
efforts to arrange for such appearance.

     6.3 Access. Following the date of this Agreement and to and including the
Effective Time, Centennial and Crescent Financial shall each provide the other
party and such other party's employees, accountants, counsel or other
representatives, access to all its books, records, files and other information
(whether maintained electronically or otherwise), to all its properties and
facilities, and to all its employees, accountants, counsel and consultants as
Centennial and Crescent Financial, as the case may be, shall, in its sole
discretion, consider to be necessary or appropriate; provided, however, that any
investigation or reviews conducted by Crescent Financial or Centennial shall be

party's normal operations or with relationship with its customers or employees,
and shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the parties
having due regard for the foregoing.

<PAGE>

transactions described herein, and, without the prior review and consent of the
others (which consent shall not unreasonably be denied or delayed), no party
hereto may make any public announcement, statement or disclosure as to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions described herein, except
for such disclosures as may be required incidental to obtaining the prior
approval of any regulatory agency or official to the consummation of the
transactions described herein. However, notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, prior review and consent shall not be required if in the
good faith opinion of counsel to Crescent Financial or Centennial any such
disclosure by Crescent Financial or Centennial, as the case may be, is required
by law or otherwise is prudent.

     6.6 Confidentiality. Crescent Financial and Centennial each shall treat as
confidential and not disclose to any unauthorized person any documents or other
information obtained from or learned about the other during the course of the
negotiation of this Agreement and the carrying out of the events and
transactions described herein (including any information obtained during the
course of any due diligence investigation or review provided for herein or
otherwise) and which documents or other information relates in any way to the
business, operations, personnel, customers or financial condition of such other
party; and that it will not use any such documents or other information for any
purpose except for the purposes for which such documents and information were
provided to it and in furtherance of the transactions described herein. However,
the above obligations of confidentiality shall not prohibit the disclosure of
any such document or information by any party to this Agreement to the extent
(i) such document or information is then available generally to the public or is
already known to the person or entity to whom disclosure is proposed to be made
(other than through the previous actions of such party in violation of this
Section 6.6), (ii) such document or information was available to the disclosing
party on a nonconfidential basis prior to the same being obtained pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) disclosure is required by subpoena or order of a court or
regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction, or by the SEC or other
regulatory authorities in connection with the transactions described herein, or
(iv) to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to such
party, disclosure otherwise is required by law. In the event this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then each of the parties hereto immediately shall
return to the other party all copies of any and all documents or other written
materials or information (including computer generated and stored data) of or
relating to such other party which were obtained from them during the course of
the negotiation of this Agreement and the carrying out of the events and
transactions described herein (whether during the course of any due diligence
investigation or review provided for herein or otherwise) and which documents or
other information relates in any way to the business, operations, personnel,
customers or financial condition of such other party. The parties' obligations
of confidentiality under this Section 6.6 shall survive and remain in effect
following any termination of this Agreement.

     6.7 Environmental Studies. At its option, Crescent Financial may cause to
be conducted Phase I environmental assessments of the Real Property, the real
estate subject to any Real Property Lease, or the Loan Collateral, or any
portion thereof, together with such other studies, testing and intrusive
sampling and analyses as Crescent Financial shall deem necessary or desirable
(collectively, the "Environmental Survey"); provided, however, that the
Environmental Survey, as much as possible, shall be performed in such a manner
as will not interfere unreasonably with Centennial's normal operations, and
provided further, however, that Centennial shall use its best efforts to obtain
any required consents of third parties to permit any

                                       44

<PAGE>

Environmental Survey of any Loan Collateral. Crescent Financial shall attempt in
good faith to complete all such Phase I environmental assessments within 60 days
following the date of this Agreement and thereafter to conduct and complete any
such additional studies, testing, sampling and analyses as promptly as
practicable. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3(c) below, the costs of the
Environmental Survey shall be paid by Crescent Financial. If (i) the final
results of any Environmental Survey (or any related analytical data) reflect
that there likely has been any discharge, disposal, release or emission by any
person of any Hazardous Substance on, from or relating to any of the Real
Property, real estate subject to a Real Property Lease or Loan Collateral at any
time prior to the Effective Time, or that any action has been taken or not
taken, or a condition or event likely has occurred or exists, with respect to
any of the Real Property, real estate subject to a Real Property Lease or Loan
Collateral which constitutes or would constitute a violation of any
Environmental Laws, and if, (ii) based on the advice of its legal counsel or
other consultants, Crescent Financial believes that Centennial or, following the
Merger, Crescent Financial or Crescent, could become responsible for the
remediation of such discharge, disposal, release or emission or for other
corrective action with respect to any such violation, or that Centennial or,
following the Merger, Crescent Financial or Crescent, could become liable for
monetary damages (including without limitation any civil or criminal penalties
or assessments) resulting therefrom (or that, in the case of any of the Loan
Collateral, Centennial or, following the Merger, Crescent Financial or Crescent,
could incur any such liability if it acquired title to such Loan Collateral),
and if, (iii) based on the advice of their legal counsel or other consultants,
Crescent Financial reasonably believes the amount of expenses or liability which
either of them could incur or for which either of them could become responsible
or liable on account of any and all such remediation, corrective action or
monetary damages at any time during the next twenty years could equal or exceed
an aggregate of $250,000, then Crescent Financial shall give Centennial prompt
written notice thereof (together with all information in its possession relating
thereto) and, at Crescent Financial's sole option and discretion, at any time
thereafter and up to the Effective Time, it may terminate this Agreement without
further obligation or liability to Centennial or its shareholders.

     6.8 Tax-Free Reorganization. Crescent Financial and Centennial shall each
use its best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a tax-free
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and that
it shall not intentionally take any action that would cause the Merger to fail
to so qualify.

     6.9 Certain Modifications. Crescent Financial and Centennial shall consult
with each other with respect to their loan, litigation and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves)
and Centennial shall make such modifications or changes to its policies and
practices, if any, prior to the Effective Time, as may be mutually agreed upon.
Crescent Financial and Centennial also shall consult with each other with
respect to the character, amount and timing of restructuring and Merger-related
expense charges to be taken by each of them in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall take such charges in accordance with
GAAP as may be mutually agreed upon by them. The representations, warranties and
covenants of each of Crescent Financial and Centennial contained in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be inaccurate or breached in any respect as a
consequence of any modifications or charges undertaken by reason of this Section
6.9.

     6.10 Transition Team. Crescent Financial and Centennial shall create a
transition team comprised of staff and representatives of Centennial and staff
and representatives of Crescent (the "Transition Team"). The purpose of the
Transition Team shall be to provide detailed guidance to Crescent Financial in
fulfilling and consummating the Merger, to maintain open lines of communication
between Centennial and Crescent Financial, and to handle customer inquiries
regarding the Merger. The Transition Team shall meet as necessary until the
Effective Time. Members of the Transition Team shall receive no separate
compensation for such service.

Centennial. Upon any such mutual termination, all obligations of Centennial and

Crescent Financial or Centennial (whether before or after approval hereof by

other parties and under the circumstances described below.

          (a) Termination by Crescent Financial. This Agreement may be
terminated by Crescent Financial by action of its Board of Directors:

               (i) if any of the conditions to the obligations of Crescent
          Financial (as set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.3 above) shall not have
          been satisfied or effectively waived in writing by Crescent Financial
          by September 20, 2003 (except to the extent that the failure of such
          condition to be satisfied has been caused by the failure of Crescent
          Financial to satisfy any of its obligations, covenants or agreements
          contained herein);

                                       50

<PAGE>

               (ii) if Centennial shall have violated or failed to fully perform
          any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in Article
          IV or Article VI herein in any material respect;

               (iii) if Crescent Financial determines at any time that any of
          Centennial's representations or warranties contained in Article II
          above or in any other certificate or writing delivered pursuant to
          this Agreement shall have been false or misleading in any material
          respect when made, or that there has occurred any event or development
          or that there exists any condition or circumstance which has caused
          or, with the lapse of time or otherwise, may or could cause any such
          representations or warranties to become false or misleading in any
          material respect;

               (iv) if, notwithstanding Crescent Financial's satisfaction of its
          obligations under Section 6.1 above, Centennial's shareholders do not
          approve this Agreement and Plan of Merger at its shareholders' meeting
          held for such purpose;

               (v) if the Merger shall not have become effective on or before
          September 30, 2003 unless such date is extended as evidenced by the
          written mutual agreement of the parties hereto; provided, however,
          that in the event there is a delay of not more than 30 days caused by
          circumstances beyond the control of the parties hereto, the dates set
          forth in this Section 8.2(a) shall be extended by mutual agreement for
          up to an additional 60 days;

               (vi) under the circumstances described in Section 6.7 above; and

               (vii) if Crescent Financial enters into a transaction with a
          third party whereby such party will acquire all or substantially all
          of the capital stock of Crescent Financial or Crescent Financial will
          merge with the third party and such agreement provides that such
          acquisition or merger may only be effected if Crescent Financial
          terminates this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event this
          Agreement is terminated by Crescent Financial pursuant to this Section
          8.2(a)(vii), Crescent Financial shall reimburse Centennial for its
          reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the Merger in an amount
          not to exceed $100,000.

     However, before Crescent Financial may terminate this Agreement for any of
the reasons specified above in (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.2(a), it
shall give written notice to Centennial as provided herein stating its intent to
terminate and a description of the specific breach, default, violation or other
condition giving rise to its right to so terminate, and, such termination by
Crescent Financial shall not become effective if, within 30 days following the
giving of such notice, Centennial shall cure such breach, default or violation
or satisfy such condition to the reasonable satisfaction of Crescent Financial.
In the event Centennial cannot or does not cure such breach, default or
violation or satisfy such condition to the reasonable satisfaction of Crescent
Financial within such 30-day period, Crescent Financial shall have 30 days to
notify Centennial of its intention to terminate this Agreement. A failure to so
notify Centennial will be

                                       51

<PAGE>

deemed to be a waiver by Crescent Financial of the breach, default or violation
pursuant to Section 10.2 below.

          (b) Termination by Centennial. This Agreement may be terminated by
Centennial by action of its Board of Directors:

               (i) if any of the conditions of the obligations of Centennial (as
          set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 above) shall not have been satisfied
          or effectively waived in writing by Centennial by September 30, 2003
          (except to the extent that the failure of such condition to be
          satisfied has been caused by the failure of Centennial to satisfy any
          of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained herein);

               (ii) if Crescent Financial shall have violated or failed to fully
          perform any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in
          Article V or Article VI herein in any material respect;

               (iii) if Centennial determines that any of Crescent Financial's
          representations and warranties contained in Article III herein or in
          any other certificate or writing delivered pursuant to this Agreement
          shall have been false or misleading in any material respect when made,
          or that there has occurred any event or development or that there
          exists any condition or circumstance which has caused or, with the
          lapse of time or otherwise, may or could cause any such
          representations or warranties to become false or misleading in any
          material respect;

               (iv) if, notwithstanding Centennial's satisfaction of its
          obligations contained in Section 6.1 above, Centennial's or Crescent
          Financial's shareholders do not approve this Agreement and Plan of
          Merger at its shareholders' meeting called for such purpose;

               (v) if, prior to the Effective Time, a corporation, partnership,
          person, or other entity or group shall have made a bona fide proposal
          to acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock of Centennial
          or to merge with Centennial (an "Acquisition Transaction") that the
          Centennial Board of Directors determines, in its good faith judgment
          and in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, with respect to legal
          matters on the written opinion of legal counsel and as to financial
          matters on the written opinion of Smith Capital or other investment
          banking firm of national reputation, is more favorable to the
          Centennial shareholders and that the failure to terminate this
          Agreement and accept such alternative Acquisition Proposal would be
          inconsistent with the proper exercise of such fiduciary duties;
          provided, however, that in the event this Agreement is terminated by
          Centennial pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(v), Centennial shall
          reimburse Crescent Financial for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
          relating to the Merger in an amount not to exceed $100,000.

                                       52

<PAGE>

     However, before Centennial may terminate this Agreement for any of the
reasons specified above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.2(b), it
shall give written notice to Crescent Financial as provided herein stating its
intent to terminate and a description of the specific breach, default, violation
or other condition giving rise to its right to so terminate, and, such
termination by Centennial shall not become effective if, within 30 days
following the giving of such notice, Crescent Financial shall cure such breach,
default or violation or satisfy such condition to the reasonable satisfaction of
Centennial. In the event Crescent Financial cannot or does not cure such breach,
default or violation or satisfy such condition to the reasonable satisfaction of
Centennial within such 30-day period, Centennial shall have 30 days to notify
Crescent Financial of its intention to terminate this Agreement. A failure to so
notify Crescent Financial will be deemed to be a waiver by Centennial of the
breach, default or violation pursuant to Section 10.2 below.

     8.3 Effect of Termination.

          (a) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Centennial
pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(v) and (ii) within 12 months of such termination,

Transaction, Centennial shall, immediately upon the consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction, make a cash payment to Crescent Financial in the amount
of $450,000. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Crescent
Financial pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vii), Crescent Financial shall, immediately
upon the consummation of such transaction, make a cash payment to Centennial in

          (b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) of this Section 8.3 and
Section 8.2(v), in the event of the termination of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall become void and have no effect except that the provisions of
this Section 10.2 and Section 6.6 of this Agreement shall survive such
termination, and neither party hereto shall have any liability to the other
party in connection with such termination.

                           ARTICLE IX. INDEMNIFICATION

          Centennial's and Crescent Financial's shareholders to contain any
          untrue statement of a material fact or to omit any material fact
          required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
          statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under
          which they were made, not false or misleading.

     9.2 Procedure for Claiming Indemnification.

          (a) By Crescent Financial. If any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder arises in the form of a claim against Crescent Financial or its
successors and assigns (herein referred to as a "Third Party Claim"), Crescent
Financial promptly shall give notice and details thereof, including copies of
all pleadings and pertinent documents, to Centennial. Within 15 days of such
notice, Centennial either (i) shall pay the Third Party Claim either in full or
upon agreed compromise or (ii) shall notify Crescent Financial that Centennial
disputes the Third Party Claim and intends to defend against it, and thereafter
shall so defend and pay any adverse final judgment or award in regard thereto.
Such defense shall be controlled by Centennial and the cost of such defense
shall be borne by Centennial except that Crescent Financial shall have the right
to participate in such defense at its own expense and provided that Centennial
shall have no right in connection with any such defense or the resolution of any
such Third Party Claim to impose any cost, restriction, limitation or condition
of any kind upon Crescent Financial or its successors or assigns. Crescent
Financial agrees that it shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, including making personnel, books and
records relevant to the Third Party Claim available to Centennial without charge
therefor except for out-of-pocket expenses. If Centennial fails to take action
within 15 days as hereinabove provided or, having taken such action, thereafter
fails diligently to defend and resolve the Third Party Claim, Crescent Financial
shall have the right to pay, compromise or defend the Third Party Claim and to
assert the indemnification provisions hereof. Crescent Financial also shall have
the right, exercisable in good faith, to take such action as may be necessary to
avoid a default prior to the assumption of the defense of the Third Party Claim
by Centennial.

          (b) By Centennial. If any matter subject to indemnification hereunder
arises in the form of a claim against Centennial or its successors and assigns
(herein referred to as a "Third Party Claim"), Centennial promptly shall give
notice and details thereof, including copies of all pleadings and pertinent
documents, to Crescent Financial. Within 15 days of such notice, Crescent
Financial either (i) shall pay the Third Party Claim either in full or upon
agreed compromise or (ii) shall notify Centennial that Crescent Financial
disputes the Third Party Claim and intends to defend against it, and thereafter
shall so defend and pay any adverse final judgment or award in regard thereto.
Such defense shall be controlled by Crescent Financial and the cost of such
defense shall be borne by Crescent Financial except that Centennial shall have
the right to participate in such defense at its own expense and provided that
Crescent Financial

                                       55

<PAGE>

shall have no right in connection with any such defense or the resolution of any
such Third Party Claim to impose any cost, restriction, limitation or condition
of any kind upon Centennial or its successors and assigns. Centennial agrees
that it shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of any such
Third Party Claim, including making personnel, books and records relevant to the
Third Party Claim available to Crescent Financial without charge therefor except
for out-of-pocket expenses. If Crescent Financial fails to take action within 15
days as hereinabove provided or, having taken such action, thereafter fails
diligently to defend and resolve the Third Party Claim, Centennial shall have
the right to pay, compromise or defend the Third Party Claim and to assert the
indemnification provisions hereof. Centennial also shall have the right,
exercisable in good faith, to take such action as may be necessary to avoid a
default prior to the assumption of the defense of the Third Party Claim by
Crescent Financial.

                      ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     10.1 Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, Crescent Financial shall have the unilateral
right to revise the structure of the Merger to achieve the tax consequences
described in Section 6.8 or for any other reason Crescent Financial may deem
advisable; provided, however, that no such change will (i) alter or change the
amount or kind of consideration to be received by the shareholders of Centennial
in the Merger or (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment to the shareholders of
Centennial as a result of receiving such consideration. In the event of such
election by Crescent Financial, the parties hereto shall execute an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement.

     10.2 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Indemnification and Other
Agreements.

          (a) Representations, Warranties and Other Agreements. None of the
representations, warranties or agreements herein shall survive the effectiveness
of the Merger, and no party shall have any right after the Effective Time to
recover damages or any other relief from any other party to this Agreement by
reason of any breach of representation or warranty, any nonfulfillment or
nonperformance of any agreement contained herein, or otherwise; provided,
however, that the parties' agreements contained in Section 6.6 above, Crescent
Financial's covenants contained in Sections 5.1 through 5.5 above shall survive
the effectiveness of the Merger.

          (b) Indemnification. The parties' indemnification agreements and
obligations pursuant to Section 9.1 above shall become effective only in the
event this Agreement is terminated, and neither of the parties shall have any
obligations under Section 9.1 in the event of or following consummation of the
Merger.

     10.3 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived (except
as to matters of regulatory approvals and approvals required by law), either in
whole or in part, at any time by the party which is, and whose shareholders are,
entitled to the benefits thereof, provided, however, that any such waiver shall
be effective only upon a determination by the waiving party (through action of
its Board of Directors) that such waiver would not adversely affect the
interests of the waiving party or its shareholders; and, provided further, that
no waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by any party shall be
effective unless such waiver is in

                                       56

<PAGE>

writing and signed by the waiving party or as provided in Sections 8.2(a) and
8.2(b) above, or be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of the
same term or condition. No failure or delay of any party to exercise any power,
or to insist upon a strict compliance by any other party of any obligation, and
no custom or practice at variance with any terms hereof, shall constitute a
waiver of the right of any party to demand full and complete compliance with
such terms.

     10.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at
any time or from time to time prior to the Effective Time, and either before or
after its approval by the shareholders of Centennial and Crescent Financial, by
an agreement in writing approved by a majority of the Boards of Directors of
Crescent Financial and Centennial executed in the same manner as this Agreement;
provided however, that the provisions of this Agreement relating to the manner
or basis in which shares of Centennial Stock are converted into Crescent
Financial Stock shall not be amended after the approval of this Agreement and
Plan of Merger by the shareholders of Centennial without the requisite approval
of such shareholders of such amendment.

                                 CENTENNIAL BANK

     1.01. Names of the Merging Corporations. The names of the banking
corporations proposed to be merged are Crescent State Bank ("Crescent") and
Centennial Bank ("Centennial").

     1.02. Nature of Transaction; Plan of Merger. Subject to the provisions of
this Plan of Merger, at the "Effective Time" specified in the Articles of Merger
filed with the North Carolina Secretary of State, Centennial will be merged into
and with Crescent pursuant to Section 53-12 of the North Carolina General
Statutes (the "Merger").

     1.03. Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, and by reason of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Centennial shall cease while the corporate
existence of Crescent, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall
continue with all of its purposes, objects, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises, all of which shall be unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger.

     1.04 Surviving Corporation. Following the Merger, Crescent shall continue
to operate as a North Carolina banking corporation and will conduct its business
at the then legally established branch and main offices of Crescent and
Centennial. The duration of the corporate existence of Crescent, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, shall be perpetual and unlimited.

     1.05. Terms and Conditions of the Merger. The Merger shall be effected
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger and of the Agreement
and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of March 12, 2003, by and among
Centennial, Crescent and Crescent's sole shareholder, Crescent Financial
Corporation, (the "Agreement").

     1.06 Assets and Liabilities of Centennial. At the Effective Time, and by
reason of the Merger, and in accordance with applicable law, all property,
assets and rights of every kind and character of Centennial (including without
limitation all real, personal or mixed property, all debts due on whatever
account, all other choses in action and every other interest of or belonging to
or due to Centennial, whether tangible or intangible) shall be transferred to
and vest in Crescent, and Crescent shall succeed to all the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of a public or private nature of
Centennial (including all trust and other fiduciary properties, powers and
rights), all without any conveyance, assignment or further act or deed; and,
Crescent shall become responsible for all other liabilities, duties and
obligations of every kind, nature and description of Centennial (including
duties as trustee or fiduciary) as of the Effective Time.

<PAGE>

     1.07. Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Management. The Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Crescent in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Crescent as the surviving
corporation in the Merger.

     1.08. Conversion of Shares.

          (a) Centennial Stock. Except as otherwise provided herein, at the
     Effective Time, all rights of Centennial's shareholders with respect to all
     then outstanding shares of the common stock of Centennial, $3.50 par value
     per share ("Centennial Stock"), shall cease to exist, and the holders of
     shares of Centennial Stock shall cease to be and shall have no further
     rights as shareholders of Centennial. At the Effective Time, each such
     outstanding share of Centennial Stock (except for shares held, other than
     in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted, by
     Centennial, Crescent or Crescent Financial Corporation, which shall be
     canceled in the Merger, and for "Dissenting Shares" (as defined in Section
     1.9 of the Agreement)) shall be converted, without any action on the part
     of the holder of such shares, into the right to receive the "Merger
     Consideration" (as defined herein) in accordance with this Plan of Merger
     and Article I of the Agreement. Following the Effective Time, certificates
     representing shares of Centennial Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
     shall evidence only the right of the registered holder thereof to receive,
     and may be exchanged for, the Merger Consideration.

          (b) Outstanding Stock of Crescent Financial Corporation and Crescent.
     Each share of common stock of Crescent Financial Corporation, par value
     $1.00 per share ("Crescent Financial Stock"), and each share of common
     stock of Crescent, par value $5.00 per share, issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and
     outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

     1.09 Merger Consideration.

          (a) Per Share Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this Plan of
     Merger and Article I of the Agreement, at the Effective Time each
     outstanding share of Centennial Stock (except for shares held, other than
     in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted, by
     Centennial, Crescent, or Crescent Financial Corporation and for Dissenting
     Shares) shall cease to represent any interest (equity, shareholder or
     otherwise) in Centennial and shall automatically be converted exclusively
     into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, either:

               (i) cash in the amount of $10.11 (the "Per Share Amount"),
          without interest;

               (ii) the "Exchange Ratio" (as defined below) of shares of
          Crescent Financial Stock; or

               (iii) 50% of the cash amount set forth in clause (i) above and a
          number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock equal to 50% of the
          Exchange Ratio;

                                       62

<PAGE>

     provided however, that a holder of Centennial Stock may, pursuant to
     Section 1.6 of the Agreement, make no election, in which case such shares
     of Centennial Stock held by such holder shall be converted exclusively into
     the right to receive the consideration set forth below with respect to
     "Non-Election Shares" (as defined in Paragraph 1.10(b) of this Plan of
     Merger). The amount of cash into which shares of Centennial Stock shall be
     converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger and the Agreement is sometimes
     hereinafter referred to as "Cash Consideration," and the number of shares
     of Crescent Financial Stock into which shares of Centennial Stock shall be
     converted pursuant to this Plan of Merger and the Agreement is sometimes
     hereinafter referred to as "Stock Consideration." The Cash Consideration
     and Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as
     the "Merger Consideration." No share of Centennial Stock, other than
     "Dissenting Shares" (as defined in Section 1.9 of the Agreement), shall be
     deemed to be outstanding or have any rights other than those set forth
     herein after the Effective Time.

          (b) Stock Consideration Exchange Ratio. The exchange ratio of Crescent
     Financial Stock for Centennial Stock shall be determined based upon the
     value of the Per Share Amount of Centennial Stock and the average of the
     closing price of Crescent Financial Stock for the thirty (30) day period
     ending three (3) business days immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
     "Exchange Ratio"). The Exchange Ratio is subject to possible adjustment in
     accordance with paragraph 1.09(d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
     calculation of the Exchange Ratio results in a ratio less than .8107, the
     Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at .8107. If calculation of the Exchange
     Ratio results in a ratio more than 1.0965, the Exchange Ratio shall be
     fixed at 1.0965.

          (c) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
     Plan of Merger and the Agreement, each holder of shares of Centennial Stock
     exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
     receive a fraction of a share of Crescent Financial Stock (after taking
     into account all certificates delivered by such holder under Sections
     1.6(c) and 1.8(a) of the Agreement and the elections made pursuant to
     Section 1.6 of the Agreement) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
     interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Crescent
     Financial Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of Crescent
     Financial Stock at the Effective Time. The market value of one share of
     Crescent Financial Stock at the Effective Time shall be the last sale price
     of Crescent Financial Stock on the Nasdaq Market, Inc. SmallCap Market
     ("Nasdaq") as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported
     thereby, any other authoritative source selected by Crescent Financial
     Corporation, on the last trading day preceding the Effective Time. No such
     holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as
     a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.

          (d) Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Crescent Financial
     Corporation changes the number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock issued
     and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
     stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange
     of shares, or similar transaction with respect to such stock and the record
     date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective

                                       63

<PAGE>

     date thereof (in the case of a stock split, recapitalization,
     reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, or similar transaction
     for which a record date is not established) shall be prior to the Effective
     Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
     change.

     1.10 Election and Allocation Procedures.

          (a) An election form (an "Election Form") and other appropriate and
     customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be
     effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
     representing Centennial Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
     certificates to the Exchange Agent (as hereinafter defined) in such form as
     Centennial and Crescent Financial Corporation shall mutually agree shall be
     mailed on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to each shareholder of record
     of Centennial. The "Mailing Date" shall be the date on which proxy
     materials relating to the Merger are mailed to holders of shares of
     Centennial Stock.

          (b) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of
     Centennial Stock (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary
     documentation and instructions) to (i) elect to receive the Cash
     Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii)
     elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a
     "Stock Election"), (iii) elect to receive Merger Consideration in
     accordance with clause (iii) of Paragraph 1.09(a) hereof (a "Mixed
     Election"), or (iv) make no election or to indicate that such holder has no
     preference as to the receipt of the Cash Consideration or the Stock
     Consideration (a "Non-Election"). Shareholders of record of Centennial who
     hold shares of Centennial Stock as nominees, trustees or in other
     representative capacities may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that
     such representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all the
     shares of Centennial Stock held by that representative for a particular
     beneficial owner. Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Cash
     Election shall have been made are referred to herein as "Cash Election
     Shares." Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Stock Election
     shall have been made are referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares."
     Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which no election shall have
     been made are referred to herein as "Non-Election Shares." The aggregate
     number of shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Stock Election
     shall have been made is referred to herein as the "Stock Election Number."
     Shares of Centennial Stock with respect to which a Mixed Election shall
     have been made shall not be deemed either Stock Election Shares or Cash
     Election Shares, but shall in all events be converted into the right to
     receive the Merger Consideration as specified in Paragraph 1.10(e) hereof.

          (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
     submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m. North Carolina time
     on the last business day prior to the date of the Centennial shareholders'
     meeting contemplated by the Agreement (or such other time and date as
     Centennial, Crescent and Crescent Financial Corporation may mutually agree)
     (the "Election Deadline"). An election shall have been properly made only
     if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
     Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed
     properly

                                       64

<PAGE>

     completed only if accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary
     affidavits and, if required by Crescent Financial Corporation pursuant to
     Section 1.8(b) of the Agreement, indemnification regarding the loss or
     destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
     certificates) representing all shares of Centennial Stock covered by such
     Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included
     with the Election Form. Any Centennial shareholder may at any time prior to
     the Election Deadline change his or her election by written notice received
     by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a
     properly completed and signed revised Election Form. Any Centennial
     shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or
     her election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
     Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
     her certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates,
     previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All elections shall be
     revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by
     Crescent Financial Corporation, Crescent and Centennial that the Agreement
     has been terminated. If a Centennial shareholder either (i)does not submit
     a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline, or (ii)
     revokes its Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
     Centennial Stock held by such shareholder shall be designated Non-Election
     Shares. Crescent Financial Corporation shall cause the certificates
     representing Centennial Stock described in clause (ii) above to be promptly
     returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon
     written request to that effect from the person who submitted the Election
     Form. Subject to the terms of the Agreement and of the Election Form, the
     Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
     election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
     disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith
     decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
     conclusive.

          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement,
     50% (the "Stock Conversion Number") of the total number of shares of
     Centennial Stock outstanding at the Effective Time to be converted into
     Merger Consideration pursuant to Paragraph 1.09(a) hereof, excluding such
     shares as may be subject to an effective Mixed Election (the "Adjustable
     Conversion Shares"), shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and
     the remaining Adjustable Conversion Shares shall be converted into Cash
     Consideration (excluding Dissenting Shares and shares of Centennial Stock
     to be canceled as provided in Section 1.4(a) of the Agreement); provided,
     however, that for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
     Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
     368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
     in order that the Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest
     requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to
     reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, as reasonably determined
     by counsel to Crescent Financial Corporation, Crescent Financial
     Corporation shall increase the number of Adjustable Conversion Shares that
     will be converted into the Stock Consideration and reduce the number of
     Adjustable Conversion Shares that will be converted into the right to
     receive the Cash Consideration.

          (e) Within five business days after the later to occur of the Election
     Deadline

                                       65

<PAGE>

     or the Effective Time, Crescent Financial shall cause the Exchange Agent to
     effect the allocation among holders of Centennial Stock of rights to
     receive the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration as follows:

               (i) In any event, all shares of Centennial Stock with respect to
          which a Mixed Election shall have been made shall be converted into
          50% of the amount of cash set forth in clause (i) of the first
          sentence of Paragraph 1.09(a) hereof and a number of shares of
          Crescent Financial Stock equal to 50% of the Exchange Ratio;

               (ii) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion
          Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares
          shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration,
          and each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive
          the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election
          Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
          Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
          numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator
          of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of
          such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
          receive the Cash Consideration; and

               (iii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
          Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
          exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
          "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted
          into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election
          Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following
          manner: (1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
          number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be
          converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and each
          holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
          respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product
          obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
          such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
          Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
          Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's
          Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
          Consideration; or (2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
          Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
          into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and each holder of
          Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect
          of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
          by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
          holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
          which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election
          Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash
          Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash
          Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
          Consideration.

     For purposes of this Paragraph 1.10(e), if Crescent Financial Corporation
is obligated to increase the number of Adjustable Conversion Shares to be
converted into shares of Crescent Financial Stock as a result of the application
of the last clause of Paragraph 1.10(d) above, then the higher number shall be
the Stock Conversion Number in the calculations set forth in this Paragraph
1.10(e).

     1.11 Treatment of Centennial Stock Options.

          (a) At the Effective Time, Crescent Financial Corporation shall assume
     each option to purchase Centennial Stock granted and outstanding under the
     Centennial Bank 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Centennial Bank
     2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Centennial Option
     Plans"), whether or not then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of
     the Centennial Option Plans and stock option agreements by which it is
     evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time with respect to
     each such plan or agreement: (i) Crescent Financial Corporation shall be
     substituted for Centennial; (ii) the Crescent Financial Corporation stock
     option committee shall be substituted for the compensation committee of the
     Centennial Board of Directors administering the Centennial Option Plans;
     (iii) each stock option granted and outstanding under the Centennial Option
     Plans may be exercised solely for shares of Crescent Financial Stock; (iv)
     the number of shares of Crescent Financial Stock subject to each such stock
     option shall be the number of whole shares of Crescent Financial Stock
     (omitting any fractional share) determined by multiplying the number of
     shares of Centennial Stock subject to such stock option immediately prior
     to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; and (v) the per share exercise
     price under each such stock option shall be adjusted by dividing the per
     share exercise price under each such stock option by the Exchange Ratio and
     rounding up to the nearest cent. In addition, each stock option which is an
     "incentive stock option" under the Centennial Option Plans shall be
     adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations
     promulgated thereunder so as to continue as an incentive stock option under
     Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to constitute a modification,
     extension, or renewal of the option, within the meaning of Section 424(h)
     of the Code. Crescent Financial Corporation and Centennial shall take all
     necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph
     1.11, including appropriate amendments to the Centennial Option Plans if
     necessary.

          (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Crescent
     Financial Corporation shall deliver to each of the participants in the
     Centennial Option Plans an appropriate notice setting forth such
     participant's rights pursuant thereto, and the grants pursuant to the
     Centennial Option Plans shall continue in effect on the same terms and
     conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Paragraph 1.11(a) hereof
     after giving effect to the Merger). At or prior to the Effective Time,
     Crescent Financial Corporation shall take all corporate action necessary to
     reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Crescent Financial Stock for
     delivery upon exercise of the stock options assumed by it in accordance
     with this Paragraph 1.11.

          (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Crescent
     Financial Corporation will use its best efforts to cause the shares subject
     to options granted under

                                       67

<PAGE>

     the Centennial Option Plans prior to the Effective Time (or any substitute
     options) to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
     "1933 Act"), on a Form S-8 (or equivalent successor form) registration
     statement.

     1.12 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by the agreement between Crescent Financial
Corporation, Crescent and Centennial shall take place at the offices of Crescent
in Cary, North Carolina, or at such other place as Crescent shall designate, on
a date mutually agreeable to Crescent and Centennial (the "Closing Date") after
the expiration of any and all required waiting periods following the effective
date of required approvals of the Merger by governmental or regulatory
authorities (but in no event more that sixty (60) days following the expiration
of all such required waiting periods).

     1.13 Abandonment. After receipt of all required shareholder, governmental
and regulatory approvals, and at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors of Crescent may, in its discretion, abandon the Merger.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

COUNTY OF WAKE

                                       CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

     This Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement (the "Agreement") entered
into by and between Crescent Financial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation
("CFC"), Crescent State Bank, a North Carolina banking corporation ("Crescent")
and John H. Ketner, Jr. ("Ketner") is made and entered into this the      day of
                                                                     ----
             , 2003.
-------------

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, CFC and Crescent have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization and Merger effective March 12, 2003 with Centennial Bank,
Southern Pines, North Carolina (the "Merger Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, Ketner served as the President of Centennial Bank ("Centennial")
since its organization pursuant to an Employment Agreement dated November 15,
2000, which contained restrictions on his ability to compete after termination
of his employment with Centennial Bank; and

     WHEREAS, the non-compete provision is not applicable upon a change of
control; and

     WHEREAS, Ketner, as an inducement for CFC and Crescent to enter into the
Merger Agreement, has agreed to continue to be subject to this Confidentiality
and Non-Compete Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and mutual
promises, covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby is
acknowledged, the Bank and Ketner hereby agree as follows:

     1. Confidentiality. Ketner hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) in the
course of his service as an officer of Centennial, he gained substantial
knowledge of and

                                       69

<PAGE>

familiarity with Centennial's customers and its dealings with them, and other
information concerning Centennial's business, all of which constitutes valuable
assets and privileged information that is particularly sensitive due to the
fiduciary responsibilities inherent in the banking business and all of which now
constitutes valuable assets and privileged information of CFC and Crescent by
virtue of the Merger Agreement; and, (ii) in order to protect CFC's and
Crescent's interest in and to assure it the benefit of the transactions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, it is reasonable and necessary to place certain
restrictions on Ketner's ability to compete against CFC and Crescent and on his
disclosure of information about CFC's and Crescent's business and customers. For
that purpose, and in consideration of CFC's and Crescent's agreements contained
herein, Ketner covenants and agrees as provided below.

          For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings set forth below:

                    Customer. The term "Customer" means any Person with whom,
as of the effective date of the Merger Agreement, Centennial had a depository,
loan and/or other banking relationship.

                    Financial Institution. The term "Financial Institution"
means any federal or state chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan
association or credit union, or any holding company for or corporation that owns
 or controls any such entity, or any other Person engaged in the business of
making loans of any type or receiving deposits, other than CFC or Crescent.

                    Person. The term "Person" means any natural person or any
corporation, partnership, proprietorship, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, estate, governmental agency or instrumentality, fiduciary,
unincorporated association or other entity.

               (a) Confidentiality Covenant. Ketner covenants and agrees that
any and all data, figures, projections, estimates, lists, files, records,
documents, manuals or other such materials or information (financial or
otherwise) relating to Centennial and its banking business, regulatory
examinations, financial results and condition, lending and deposit operations,
customers (including lists of Centennial's customers and information regarding
their accounts and business dealings with Centennial), policies and procedures,
computer systems and software, shareholders, employees, officers and directors
(herein referred to as "Confidential Information") are proprietary to CFC and
Crescent and are valuable, special and unique assets of CFC's and

                                       70

<PAGE>

Crescent's business to which Ketner had access during his employment with
Centennial. Ketner agrees that (i) all such Confidential Information shall be
considered and kept as the confidential, private and privileged records and
information of Crescent, and (ii) at all times during the term of this Agreement
or otherwise pursuant to the direct, written authorization of CFC or Crescent,
Ketner will not: divulge any such Confidential Information to any other Person
or Financial Institution; or make any use of any Confidential Information for
his own purposes or for the benefit of any Person or Financial Institution.
However, this subparagraph (a) shall not apply to any Confidential Information
which is in the public domain (provided that Ketner was not responsible,
directly or indirectly, for permitting such Confidential Information to enter
the public domain without CFC's or Crescent's consent), or which is obtained by
Ketner from a third party which or who is not obligated under an agreement of
confidentiality with respect to such information.

               (b) Covenant Not to Compete. Ketner acknowledges that Centennial
invested substantial time, money and resources in the development of its
business, its competitive strategy, and the development of its Customers and
that during the course of Ketner's employment with Centennial, Ketner has had
access to Centennial's information in that regard and that such information, by
reason of the Merger Agreement, is now the property of CFC and Crescent. Ketner
further acknowledges that CFC's and Crescent's business is a sixty (60) mile
radius from each of its branch offices in operation at the time of this
Agreement, including the offices of Centennial. In recognition of this, Ketner
covenants and agrees that for a period of one (1) year from the date hereof,
Ketner will not, directly or indirectly (i) provide in CFC's and Crescent's
relevant market, as set forth above, financial services or become employed in
any manner by any Financial Institution; (ii) consult with organizers to create
a de novo Financial Institution; (iii) otherwise compete with CFC or Crescent;
or (iv) recruit or hire any person employed by Crescent on the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ketner shall be entitled to be a
consultant, full time or part time employee of Sidus Financial Corporation
provided that Ketner's consultative or employee duties and responsibilities
shall be commensurate with the business and operations of Sidus Financial
Corporation in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

               (c) Remedies for Breach. Ketner understands and agrees that a
breach or violation by him of the covenants contained in this Agreement will be
deemed a

                                       71

<PAGE>

material breach of this Agreement and will cause irreparable injury to CFC and
Crescent, and that it would be difficult to ascertain the amount of monetary
damages that would result from any such violation. In the event of Ketner's
actual or threatened breach or violation of the covenants contained in this
Agreement, CFC or Crescent shall be entitled to bring a civil action seeking an
injunction restraining Ketner from violating or continuing to violate those
covenants or from any threatened violation thereof, or for any other legal or
equitable relief relating to the breach or violation of such covenant. Ketner
agrees that, if CFC or Crescent institute any action or proceeding against
Ketner seeking to enforce any of such covenants or to recover other relief
relating to an actual or threatened breach or violation of any of such
covenants, Ketner shall be deemed to have waived the claim or defense that CFC
or Crescent has an adequate remedy at law and shall not urge in any such action
or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists. However,
the exercise by CFC or Crescent of any such right, remedy, power or privilege
shall not preclude CFC or Crescent or their successors or assigns from pursuing
any other remedy or exercising any other right, power or privilege available to
it for any such breach or violation, whether at law or in equity, including the
recovery of damages, all of which shall be cumulative and in addition to all
other rights, remedies, powers or privileges of CFC or Crescent.

               Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Ketner
agrees that the provisions of this Agreement and the remedies provided herein
for a breach by Ketner shall be in addition to, and shall not be deemed to
supersede or to otherwise restrict, limit or impair the rights of CFC or
Crescent under the Trade Secrets Protection Act contained in Article 24, Chapter
66 of the North Carolina General Statutes, or any other state or federal law or
regulation dealing with or providing a remedy for the wrongful disclosure,
misuse or misappropriation of trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential
information.

     2. Term and Consideration. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof
and continue for a period of one (1) year hereafter. As consideration for
Ketner's covenants and agreements under this Agreement, Crescent hereby agrees
to pay to Ketner in such number of installments or in one lump sum payment as
determined by Ketner, the average annualized amount as set forth on Exhibit A
hereto.

     3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the
parties

                                       72

<PAGE>

with respect to the transactions described herein and supersedes any and all
other oral or written agreements heretofore made, and there are no
representations or inducements by or to, or any agreements between, any of the
parties hereto other than those contained herein in writing.

          5. Confidentiality; Noncompetition. Employee hereby acknowledges and
agrees that (i) in the course of his service as an officer of the Bank, he will
gain substantial knowledge of and familiarity with the Bank's customers and its
dealings with them, and other information concerning the Bank's business, all of
which constitutes valuable assets and privileged information that is
particularly sensitive due to the fiduciary responsibilities inherent in the
banking business; and, (ii) in order to protect the Bank's interest in and to
assure it the benefit of its business, it is reasonable and necessary to place
certain restrictions on Employee's ability to compete against the Bank and on
his disclosure of information about the Bank's business and customers. For that
purpose, and in consideration of the Bank's agreements contained herein,
Employee covenants and agrees as provided below.

               (a) Covenant Not to Compete. During a period of three (3) years
following the effective date of termination of this Agreement or Employee's
employment with the Bank for any reason (except for termination of employment
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 hereof), Employee will not "Compete" (as
defined below), directly or indirectly, with the Bank within a sixty (60) mile
radius of Southern Pines, North Carolina (the "Relevant Market").

          For the purposes of this Paragraph 5, the following terms shall have
the meanings set forth below:

                    Compete. The term "Compete" means: (i) soliciting or
securing deposits from any Person residing in the Relevant Market for any
Financial Institution; (ii) soliciting any Person residing in the Relevant
Market to become a borrower from any Financial Institution, or assisting (other
than through the performance of ministerial or clerical duties) any Financial
Institution in making loans to any such Person; (iii) including or attempting to
induce any Person who was a Customer of the Bank on the date of termination of
Employee's employment with the Bank, to change such Customer's depository, loan
and/or other banking relationship from the Bank to another Financial
Institution; (iv) acting as a consultant, officer, director, independent
contractor, or employee of any Financial Institution that has its main or
principal office in the Relevant Market, or, in acting in any such capacity with
any other Financial Institution, to maintain an office or be employed at or
assigned to or to have any direct involvement in the management, business or
operation of any office of such Financial Institution located in the Relevant
Market; or (v) communicating to any Financial Institution the names or

                                       79

<PAGE>

addresses or any financial information concerning any Person who was a Customer
of the Bank at the date of Employee's termination of this Agreement.

                    Customer. The term "Customer" means any Person with whom, as
of the effective date of termination of this Agreement or during Employee's
employment with the Bank, the Bank has or has had a depository, loan and/or
other banking relationship.

                    Financial Institution. The term "Financial Institution"
means any federal or state chartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan
association or credit union, or any holding company for or corporation that owns
or controls any such entity, or any other Person engaged in the business of
making loans of any type or receiving deposits, other than the Bank.

                    Person. The term "Person" means any natural person or any
corporation, partnership, proprietorship, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, estate, governmental agency or instrumentality, fiduciary,
unincorporated association or other entity.

               (b) Confidentiality Covenant. Employee covenants and agrees that
any and all data, figures, projections, estimates, lists, files, records,
documents, manuals or other such materials or information (financial or
otherwise) relating to the Bank and its banking business, regulatory
examinations, financial results and condition, lending and deposit operations,
customers (including lists of the Bank's customers and information regarding
their accounts and business dealings with the Bank), policies and procedures,
computer systems and software, shareholders, employees, officers and directors
(herein referred to as "Confidential Information") are proprietary to the Bank
and are valuable, special and unique assets of the Bank's business to which
Employee will have access during his employment with the Bank. Employee agrees
that (i) all such Confidential Information shall be considered and kept as the
confidential, private and privileged records and information of the Bank, and
(ii) at all times during the term of his employment with the Bank and following
the termination of this Agreement or his employment for any reason, and except
as shall be required in the course of the performance by Employee of his duties
on behalf of the Bank or otherwise pursuant to the direct, written authorization
of the Bank, Employee will not: divulge any such Confidential Information to any
other Person or Financial Institution; remove any such Confidential Information
in written or other recorded form from the Bank's premises; or make any use of
any Confidential Information for his own purposes or for the benefit of any
Person or Financial Institution other than the Bank. However, following the
termination of Employee's employment with the Bank,

                                       80

<PAGE>

this subparagraph (b) shall not apply to any Confidential Information which then
is in the public domain (provided that Employee was not responsible, directly or
indirectly, for permitting such Confidential Information to enter the public
domain without the Bank's consent), or which is obtained by Employee from a
third party which or who is not obligated under an agreement of confidentiality
with respect to such information.

               (c) Remedies for Breach. Employee understands and agrees that a
breach or violation by him of the covenants contained in Paragraph 5(a) and 5(b)
of this Agreement will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and will
cause irreparable injury to the Bank, and that it would be difficult to
ascertain the amount of monetary damages that would result from any such
violation. In the event of Employee's actual or threatened breach or violation
of the covenants contained in Paragraph 5(a) or 5(b) , the Bank shall be
entitled to bring a civil action seeking an injunction restraining Employee from
violating or continuing to violate those covenants or from any threatened
violation thereof, or for any other legal or equitable relief relating to the
breach or violation of such covenant. Employee agrees that, if the Bank
institutes any action or proceeding against Employee seeking to enforce any of
such covenants or to recover other relief relating to an actual or threatened
breach or violation of any of such covenants, Employee shall be deemed to have
waived the claim or defense that the Bank has an adequate remedy at law and
shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a
remedy at law exists. However, the exercise by the Bank of any such right,
remedy, power or privilege shall not preclude the Bank or its successors or
assigns from pursuing any other remedy or exercising any other right, power or
privilege available to it for any such breach or violation, whether at law or in
equity, including the recovery of damages, all of which shall be cumulative and
in addition to all other rights, remedies, powers or privileges of the Bank.

               Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Employee agrees that the provisions of Paragraph 5(a) and 5(b) above and the
remedies provided in this Paragraph 5(c) for a breach by Employee shall be in
addition to, and shall not be deemed to supersede or to otherwise restrict,
limit or impair the rights of the Bank under the Trade Secrets Protection Act
contained in Article 24, Chapter 66 of the North Carolina General Statutes, or
any other state or federal law or regulation dealing with or providing a remedy
for the wrongful disclosure, misuse or misappropriation of trade secrets or
other proprietary or confidential information.

               (d) Survival of Covenants. Employee's covenants and agreements
and the Bank's rights and remedies provided for in this Paragraph 5 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement or Employee's employment with the
Bank.

          6. Termination and Termination Pay.

               (a) Employee's employment under this Agreement may be terminated
at any time by Employee upon ninety (90) days written notice to the Bank. Upon
such termination, Employee shall be entitled to receive compensation through the
effective date of such termination; provided, however, that the Bank, in its
sole discretion, may elect for Employee not to serve out part or all of said
notice period.

               (b) Employee's employment under this Agreement shall be
terminated upon the death of Employee during the term of this Agreement. Upon
any such termination, Employee's estate shall be entitled to receive any
compensation due to Employee computed through the last day of the calendar month
in which his death shall have occurred but which remains unpaid.

               (c) In the event Employee becomes disabled during the term of his
employment hereunder and it is determined by the Bank that Employee is
permanently unable to perform his duties under this Agreement, Employee's
employment hereunder shall terminate, provided, however, that the Bank shall
continue to compensate Employee at the level of compensation described in
Paragraph 2 above, and shall continue to provide Employee each of the other
benefits set forth or described in this Agreement, for the ninety (90) day
period as set forth in the Bank's extended sick leave policy. Thereafter,
Employee shall not be entitled to any compensation or benefit hereunder and
shell only received benefits under the Bank's long-term disability policy. In
the event of any disagreement between Employee and the Bank as to whether
Employee is physically or mentally incapacitated such as will result in the
termination of Employee's employment pursuant to this Paragraph 6(c), the
question of such incapacity shall be submitted to an impartial and reputable
physician for determination, selected by mutual agreement of Employee and the
Bank or, failing such agreement, by two (2) physicians (one (1) of whom shall be
selected by the Bank and the other by Employee), and such determination of the
question of such incapacity by such physician or physicians shall be final and
binding on Employee and the Bank. The Bank shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such physician or physicians in making any determination required
under this Paragraph 6(c). After such ninety

                                       82

<PAGE>

(90) day period, Employee shall not be entitled to any benefits provided
hereunder except for receipt of payments under the Bank's then current
disability insurance policy applicable to Employee.

               (d) The Bank may terminate Employee's employment at any time for
any reason with or without "Cause" (as defined below), but any termination by
the Bank other than termination for "Cause", (as defined below) shall not
prejudice Employee's right to compensation or other benefits under this
Agreement. Following any termination of Employee's employment by the Bank for
"Cause", Employee shall have no further rights under this Agreement (including
any right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after such
termination).

          For purposes of this Paragraph 6(d), the Bank shall have "Cause" to
terminate Employee's employment upon:

                    (i) A determination by the Bank, in good faith, that
Employee (A) has breached in any material respect any of the terms or conditions
of this Agreement, or (B) is engaging or has engaged in willful misconduct or
conduct which is detrimental to the business prospects of the Bank or which has
had or likely will have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business or
reputation. Prior to any termination by the Bank of Employee's employment for a
breach, failure to perform or conduct described in this subparagraph (i), the
Bank shall give Employee written notice which describes such breach, failure to
perform or conduct and if during a period of five (5) business days following
such notice Employee cures or corrects the same to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Bank, then this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. However,
notwithstanding the above, if the Bank has given written notice to Employee on a
previous occasion of the same or a substantially similar breach, failure to
perform or conduct, or of a breach, failure to perform or conduct which the Bank
determines in good faith to be of substantially similar import, or if the Bank
determines in good faith that the then current breach, failure to perform or
conduct is not reasonably curable, then termination under this subparagraph (i)
shall be effective immediately and Employee shall have no right to cure such
breach, failure to perform or conduct.

                    (ii) The violation by Employee of any applicable federal or
state law, or any applicable rule, regulation, order or statement of policy
promulgated by any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over the
Bank or any of its affiliates or

                                       83

<PAGE>

subsidiaries (a "Regulatory Authority", including without limitation the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks or any
other banking regulator having legal jurisdiction over the Bank), which results
from Employee's gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional disregard of
such law, rule, regulation, order or policy statement and results in any
substantial damage, monetary or otherwise, to the Bank or any of its affiliates
or subsidiaries or to the Bank's reputation;

                    (iii) The commission in the course of Employee's employment
with the Bank of an act of fraud, embezzlement, theft or proven personal
dishonesty (whether or not resulting in criminal prosecution or conviction);

                    (iv) The conviction of Employee of any felony or any
criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or the occurrence of
any event described in Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any
other event or circumstance which disqualifies Employee from serving as an
employee or executive officer of, or a party affiliated with, the Bank or its
bank holding company;

                    (v) Employee becomes unacceptable to, or is removed,
suspended or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs
(or if proceedings for that purpose are commenced) by any Regulatory Authority;
and,

                    (vi) The occurrence of any event believed by the Bank, in
good faith, to have resulted in Employee being excluded from coverage, or having
coverage limited as to Employee as compared to other covered officers or
employees, under the Bank's then current "blanket bond" or other fidelity bond
or insurance policy covering its directors, officers or employees.

          7. Additional Regulatory Requirements. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that
the Bank (or its successors in interest) shall not be required to make any
payment or take any action under this Agreement if (a) the Bank is declared by
any Regulatory Authority to be insolvent, in default or operating in an unsafe
or unsound manner, or if (b) in the opinion of counsel to the Bank such payment
or action (i) would be prohibited by or would violate any provision of state or
federal law applicable to the Bank, including without limitation the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act and Chapter 53 of the North Carolina General Statutes as
now in effect or hereafter amended, (ii) would be prohibited by or would violate
any applicable rules, regulations, orders or statements of

                                       84

<PAGE>

policy, whether now existing or hereafter promulgated, of any Regulatory
Authority, or (iii) otherwise would be prohibited by any Regulatory Authority.

          8. Change in Control

               (a) In the event of a "Change in Control" (as defined in
Subparagraph (d) below), of Crescent Financial Corporation, parent holding
company of the Bank ("CFC"), Employee shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement upon the occurrence, following a Change in Control, of any Termination
Event as defined in Subparagraph (b) below.

               (b) A Termination Event shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following events:

                    (i)     Employee is assigned any duties and/or
                            responsibilities that are inconsistent with his
                            position, duties, responsibilities or status at the
                            time of the Change in Control or with his reporting
                            responsibilities with the Bank in effect at such
                            time;

                    (ii)    Employee's annual base salary is reduced below the
                            amount in effect as of the effective date of a
                            Change in Control or as the same shall have been
                            increased from time to time following such effective
                            date;

                    (iii)   Employee's life insurance, medical or

                            dental insurance, stock option plans, stock purchase
                            plans, deferred compensation plans, management
                            retention plans, retirement plans, or similar plans
                            or benefits being provided by the Bank to Employee
                            as of the effective date of the Change in Control
                            are reduced in their level, scope or coverage or any
                            such insurance, plans, or benefits are eliminated,
                            unless such reduction or elimination applies
                            proportionately to all salaried employees of the
                            Bank who participated in such benefits prior to such
                            Change in Control; or

                    (iv)    Employee is transferred to a location outside of
                            Moore

                            County, North Carolina, without Employee's express
                            written consent.

                            A Termination Event shall be deemed to have occurred
                            on the date such action or event is implemented or
                            takes effect.

               (c)  In the event that Employee terminates this Agreement or the

                    Bank are sold or otherwise transferred to or are acquired by
                    any other corporation, association, or other person, entity,
                    or group.

               Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Paragraph 8, a
transaction or event shall not be considered a Change in Control if, prior to
the consummation or occurrence of such transaction or event, Employee and the
Bank agree in writing that the same shall not be treated as a Change in Control
for purposes of this Agreement.

               (e) Amounts payable pursuant to this Paragraph 8 shall be paid,
at the option of Employee either in one lump sum or in equal monthly payments
over the remaining term of this Agreement.

rights hereunder, Employee shall have twelve (12) months from the date of
occurrence of the Termination Event to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Paragraph 8. Any such termination shall be deemed to have occurred only upon
delivery to the Bank or any successor thereto, of written notice of termination,
which describes the Change in Control and Termination Event. If Employee does
not so terminate this Agreement within such twenty-four month period, Employee
shall thereafter have no further rights hereunder with respect to that
Termination Event, but shall retain rights, if any, hereunder with respect to
any other Termination Event as to which such period has not expired.

               (g) It is the intent of the parties hereto that all payments made
pursuant to this Agreement be deductible by the Bank for federal income tax
purposes and not result in the imposition of an excise tax on Employee.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
payments to be made to or for the benefit of Employee which are deemed to be
"parachute payments" as that term is defined in Section 28OG(b) (2) of the Code,
shall be modified or reduced to the extent deemed to be necessary by the Bank's
Board of Directors to avoid the imposition of an excise tax on Employee under
Section 4999 of the Code or the disallowance of a deduction to the Bank under
Section 28OG(a) of the Code.

               (h) In the event any dispute shall arise between Employee and the
Bank as to the terms or interpretation of this Agreement, including this
Paragraph 8, whether instituted by formal legal proceedings or otherwise,
including any action taken by Employee to enforce the terms of this Paragraph 8
or in defending against any action taken by the Bank, the

                                       87

Bank shall reimburse Employee for all costs and expenses, proceedings or
actions, in the event Employee prevails in any such action.

or indirectly, by conversion, merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, all
or substantially all of the assets of the Bank.

               (b) The Bank is contracting for the unique and personal skills of
Employee. Therefore, Employee shall be precluded from assigning or delegating
his rights or duties hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of
the Bank.

          10. Modification; Waiver; Amendments. No provision of this Agreement
may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or
discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the parties hereto. No waiver by
either party hereto, at any time, of any breach by the other party hereto of, or
compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by
such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No amendments or
additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by
both parties, except as herein otherwise provided.

          11. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects
whether as to validity, construction, capacity, performance or otherwise, by the
laws of North Carolina, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
apply.

          12. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

          13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the transactions described herein and supersedes any
and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made, and there are no
representations or inducements by or to, or any agreements between, any of the
parties hereto other than those contained herein in writing.

          14. Centennial Agreement. By entering into this Agreement, Employee
acknowledges that the Centennial Agreement is hereby deemed to be null, void and
of no further
