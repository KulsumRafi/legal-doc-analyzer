Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and

Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. (the "Counterparty") and Capital Auto
Receivables Asset Trust 2003-1 (the "Trust") as of the Trade Date listed below
(the "Transaction"). This letter constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in
the Primary ISDA Agreement specified below.

1.       The definitions and provisions contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions
         (the "Definitions"), as published by the International Swaps and
         Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA"), are incorporated into this
         Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between those
         definitions and provisions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation
         will govern. The parties agree that this transaction is a Transaction
         under the ISDA Master Agreement of the parties dated as of January 15,
         2003. The agreement is comprised of the printed form of such agreement
         as published by ISDA, as supplemented and modified by a Schedule (the
         "Primary ISDA Agreement").

         This Confirmation constitutes a binding agreement between you and us
         and will supplement, form a part of, and be subject to the Primary ISDA

         to the Trust Agreement.

         Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein, in the Primary

         The Trust will give the Counterparty prompt written notice of any
         Default under the Indenture.

4.       Credit Downgrade: In the event that the Joint Probability is reduced
         below AA- in the case of S&P or Aa3, in the case of Moody's, the
         Offsetting Counterparty shall promptly notify the Trust (and any
         permitted assignee or transferee of the Trust) and the Counterparty of
         such event and (unless, within thirty (30) days after such reduction,
         the applicable Rating Agency has reconfirmed the ratings of the
         Certificates and the Other Securities that were in effect immediately
         prior to such reduction) the Counterparty shall within thirty (30) days
         of receipt of notice of such reduction, with the prior written
         confirmation of the applicable Rating Agency that such arrangement will
         not result in the reduction of the rating of any of the Certificates or
         the Other Securities existing immediately prior to the reduction of the
         applicable Joint Probability, either:

                  (1) (x) obtain a substitute swap provider (the "Substitute
                  Swap Provider") acceptable to the Trust (such acceptance not
                  to be unreasonably withheld) and replace this Transaction with
                  a swap transaction on substantially similar terms or with such
                  other amendments as consented to in writing by the Trust
                  (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided
                  such replacement would result in an S&P Joint Probability of
                  at least AA- and a Moody's Joint Probability of at least Aa3,
                  except that such Substitute Swap Provider shall thenceforth be
                  the "Counterparty" hereunder; or (y) replace, with the consent
                  of the then current Offsetting Counterparty, the swap
                  transaction with the then current Offsetting Counterparty with
                  a swap transaction with a replacement Offsetting Counterparty
                  on terms approved by S&P and Moody's or enter into a swap
                  transaction with another party such that such party shall be
                  acting as an intermediary between the Counterparty and the
                  then current Offsetting Counterparty (such replacement or
                  intermediary being the "Replacement Offsetting Counterparty");
                  or

                  (2) enter into an ISDA Credit Support Annex with the Trust
                  mutually acceptable to the Trust and the Counterparty; or

                  (3) enter into such other credit support arrangements to
                  assure performance by the Counterparty of its obligations
                  under this Transaction.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Joint Probability
         is reduced below A- in the case of S&P, or A3, in the case of Moody's,
         then the Offsetting Counterparty shall promptly notify the Trust (and
         any permitted assignee or transferee of the Trust) and the Counterparty
         of such event and (unless, within thirty (30) days after such reduction
         the applicable Rating Agency has reconfirmed the ratings of the
         Certificates and the Other Securities that were in effect immediately
         prior to such reduction) the Counterparty shall within thirty (30) days
         of receipt of notice of such reduction, with the prior written
         confirmation of the applicable Rating Agency that such arrangement will
         not result in the reduction of the rating of any of the Certificates or
         the Other Securities existing immediately prior to the reduction of the
         applicable Joint Probability as a direct result of the reduction of
         such Joint Probability, obtain a Substitute Swap Provider acceptable to
         the Trust (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld) and replace
         this Transaction with a swap transaction on substantially similar terms
         or with such other amendments as consented to in writing by the Trust
         (which consent shall not

                                       3

<PAGE>

         be unreasonably withheld) provided such replacement would result in an
         S&P Joint Probability of at least AA- or a Moody's Joint Probability of
         Aa3 except that such Substitute Swap Provider shall thenceforth be the
         "Counterparty" hereunder.

         Upon any replacement of this Transaction with a swap transaction with a
         Substitute Swap Provider, this Transaction shall terminate without any
         payment by either party hereto and any and all collateral posted by the
         Counterparty shall be returned to it within three (3) Business Days and
         any other form of collateral arrangement (including letters of credit,
         surety bond or other guarantee) provided by or on behalf of the
         Counterparty shall terminate.

         In the event that the Counterparty fails to satisfy its obligations set
         forth above in this Section 4, the Trust or any permitted assignee or
         transferee of the Trust shall have the option, exercisable in its
         discretion and with regard to the interests of the Certificateholders,
         within ten (10) Business Days following the date of expiry of the
         thirty (30) day period after the date of receipt of notice of the
         reduction (unless, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of such
         reduction, the applicable Rating Agency has reconfirmed the rating of
         the Certificates that was in effect immediately prior to such
         reduction), to designate (in writing) an Early Termination Date on the
         basis that such failure shall be treated as a Termination Event with
         the Counterparty as the Affected Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the
         Counterparty and the Trust acknowledge and agree that any such failure
         shall not constitute an Event of Default.

2.02 of the Triparty Agreement, then the term "Moody's Joint Probability" shall
refer to the Offsetting Counterparty's long term senior unsecured credit rating
assigned by Moody's (and, for avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the
Counterparty specified in Section 4 of this Confirmation shall constitute
obligations of the Offsetting Counterparty).

applicable, a guarantor thereof.

     "Rating Agency": each of S&P and Moody's.

     "S&P": Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and its successors.

     "S&P Joint Probability" means the joint probability determined by S&P of

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that the long-term senior
unsecured debt rating of either the Primary Party or the Contingent Party is
rated below BBB- by S&P, then the S&P Joint Probability shall be the higher of
the then current long-term senior unsecured debt rating of the Primary Party and
the Contingent Party and (ii) in the event that under the Triparty Agreement the
Offsetting Counterparty has acceded to the rights of the Counterparty and no
swap transaction has been effected with an additional contingent counterparty or
replacement swap counterparty under the circumstances contemplated by Section
2.02 of the Triparty Agreement, then the term "S&P Joint Probability" shall
refer to the Offsetting Counterparty's long-term senior unsecured credit rating
assigned by S&P (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the
Counterparty specified in Section 4 of this Confirmation shall constitute
obligations of the Offsetting Counterparty).

     "Triparty Agreement": the Triparty Contingent Assignment Agreement dated as
of the Effective Date among the Trust, the Offsetting Counterparty and the
