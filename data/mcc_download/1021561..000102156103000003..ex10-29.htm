<B><U>Security Deposit</U></B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">. As of the date
of this lease, no security deposit is being required from Tenant with respect to
any of the Premises. In accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 and
Section 7.1 below, however, Landlord may hereafter require a security deposit
with respect to some or all of the Premises, which may, at Tenant&#146;s
election, be made by depositing cash or by posting an irrevocable letter of
credit in the form specified below in this Section 3.3. If Tenant deposits a
letter of credit with Landlord pursuant to either this Section 3.3 or Section
7.1, the following provisions shall apply to such letter of credit: (a) payment
of such letter of credit by the issuer shall be conditioned solely upon
submission to the issuer of written demand for payment by Landlord, (b) Tenant
shall, at least five (5) business days prior to the expiration of the term of
such letter of credit provide Landlord with either a renewal letter of credit
(in the form specified in this Section 3.3) or cash in the amount of such letter
of credit to be held pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.3, and (c) if
at least five (5) business days prior to the expiration of a letter of credit
deposited by Tenant with Landlord Tenant has not provided Landlord with either a
replacement letter of credit or cash in accordance with (b) above, Landlord
shall have the right to draw down the full amount of such letter of credit and
hold the proceeds thereof as a cash deposit in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.3. If, pursuant to the provisions of either this Section 3.3 or
Section 7.1 below a security deposit is required with respect to any of the
Premises (hereinafter a &#147;Premises Security Deposit&#148;), the following
provisions of this Section 3.3 shall apply. For purposes of this Section 3.3,
the term &#147;Security Deposits&#148; shall mean all Premises Security
Deposits, taken in the aggregate. Provided that no uncured Tenant default of
which Landlord has given Tenant written notice is then existing with respect to
the Premises concerned, the Premises Security Deposit applicable to such
Premises shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord&#146;s option, to the last
permitted assignee of Tenant&#146;s interest under this Lease) after the
expiration of the term applicable to such Premises, or sooner termination of
this Lease, and delivery of possession of such Premises to Landlord in
accordance with ARTICLE 20. If Landlord&#146;s interest in this Lease is
conveyed, transferred or assigned, Landlord shall transfer or credit the
Security Deposits to Landlord&#146;s successor in interest, and Landlord shall
be released from any liability for the return of the Security Deposits, provided
that such successor in interest assumes all of Landlord&#146;s obligations under
this Lease. Landlord may intermingle the Security Deposits with Landlord&#146;s
own funds, and shall not be deemed to be a trustee of the Security Deposit.
Tenant shall not be entitled to receive interest with respect to the Security
Deposits. If Tenant fails to timely pay or perform any obligation under this
Lease, Landlord may, prior to, concurrently with or subsequent to exercising any
other right or remedy, use, apply or retain all or any part of the Premises
Security Deposit then held by Landlord with respect to the Premises concerned
for the payment of any monetary obligation due under this Lease for such
Premises, or to compensate Landlord for any other expense, loss or damage which
Landlord may incur by reason of Tenant&#146;s failure, including any damage or
deficiency in the reletting of such Premises. If all or any portion of the
Security Deposits is so used, applied or retained, Tenant shall immediately
deposit with Landlord cash in an amount sufficient to restore the Security
Deposits to the original amount. Landlord may withhold the Premises Security
Deposit after the expiration of the term for the Premises concerned or sooner
termination of this Lease until Tenant has paid the full Tenant&#146;s share of
any Impositions or any other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease, but
only with respect to the Premises concerned. The Security Deposits are not a
limitation on Landlord&#146;s damages or other rights under this Lease, a
payment of liquidated damages or prepaid rent, and shall not be applied by
Tenant to the rent for the last (or any) month of the term with respect to any
Premises, or to any other amount due under this Lease. Tenant agrees that if

thereby). Entry into any of the Premises by Landlord or any other person or firm
named in the first sentence of this ARTICLE 13 for any purpose permitted herein
shall not constitute a trespass or an eviction (constructive or otherwise), or
entitle Tenant to any abatement or reduction of Monthly Rent, or constitute

injury to or interference with Tenant&#146;s business, for loss of occupancy or
quiet enjoyment, or for consequential damages, excepting any damage or injury to

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"><SMALL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Paragraph, the
term &#147;Condemnation Proceedings&#148; means any actions or proceedings in
which any interest in any Premises (the &#147;Affected Premises&#148;) is taken
for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful authority through exercise
of the power of eminent domain or by purchase or other means in lieu of such
exercise. If the whole of the Affected Premises is taken through Condemnation
Proceedings, this Lease shall automatically terminate as of the date of the
taking with respect to the Affected Premises (only). The phrase &#147;as of the
date of the taking&#148; means the date of taking actual physical possession by
the condemning authority or such earlier date as the condemning authority gives
notice that it is deemed to have taken possession. Tenant may terminate this
Lease with respect to the Affected Premises if more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the Affected Premises is taken or any portion of the Affected Premises
is taken which substantially interferes with Tenant&#146;s ability to operate or
use the Affected Premises for either the permitted use for such Premises
specified in <U>Schedule A</U> or such other use of such Affected Premises for
which Landlord has previously given written approval. Any such termination must
be accomplished through written notice given no later than thirty (30) days
after, and shall be effective as of, the date of such taking. In all other
cases, or if Tenant fails to exercise its right to terminate, this Lease shall
remain in effect, and Tenant shall, subject to the availability of adequate
condemnation proceeds, promptly repair and restore the Affected Premises as
nearly as possible to the nature and character that existed immediately prior to
such taking and, to the extent required by Section 12.1, in accordance with
plans approved by Landlord. If a portion of the Affected Premises is taken and
this Lease is not terminated, the Monthly Rent shall be reduced in the
proportion that the area of the Premises taken bears to the total area of the
Premises immediately prior to the taking. Whether or not this Lease is
terminated as a consequence of Condemnation Proceedings, all damages or
compensation awarded for a partial or total taking, including any award for
severance damage and any sums compensating for diminution in the value of or
deprivation of the leasehold estate under this Lease, shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Landlord, provided that Tenant shall be entitled to any
award for the loss of, or damage to, Tenant&#146;s trade fixtures, loss of
business and moving expenses; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if (y) this
Lease is not terminated as a consequence of Condemnation Proceedings, and (z)
Landlord receives an award in such Condemnation Proceedings for the repair and
restoration of the Premises, Landlord shall make available to Tenant all or a
portion of the award so designated, as necessary, for Tenant to complete its
obligations of repair and restoration under this Paragraph. If made, the
disbursement of such portion of the award shall be made by Landlord to Tenant in
accordance with disbursement procedures typically used by construction lenders
in the Provo/Orem, Utah metropolitan area. Tenant shall have no claim against
Landlord for the occurrence of any Condemnation Proceedings, or for the
termination of this Lease or a reduction in the Premises as a result of any
Condemnation Proceedings.</SMALL></FONT> </P>

any insurance proceeds received by Landlord and attributed to Tenant&#146;s
property as provided more fully above, if any, Tenant shall have no claim
