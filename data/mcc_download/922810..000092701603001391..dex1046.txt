     2.1.   Revolving Loan. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and so long as no Default exists, from time to time on and after the
Initial Closing Date and prior to the Final Maturity Date, each Tranche I Only
Lender and each Tranche II Lender will make loans to the Company up to the
amount set forth opposite his name on Schedule 1 hereto and in such amounts as
may be requested by the Company in accordance with Section 2.3; provided,
however, that the Lenders agree, and the Company acknowledges, that (a) for any
portion of the Loan up to or equal to $500,000 of the Maximum Amount of Credit
("Tranche I"), the Lenders shall make loans to the Company, on a pro rata basis
as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto, upon the Company's request in accordance with
Section 2.3 and (b) for any amount of the Loan in excess of $500,000 ("Tranche
II"), the Tranche II Lenders shall make loans to the Company, on a pro rata
basis as set forth on Schedule 3 hereto, upon the Company's request in
accordance with Section 2.3. The Company acknowledges and agrees that each
Lender's obligation hereunder to loan such amounts to the Company is several and
not joint. The sum of the aggregate principal amount of loans made under this
Section 2.1 at any one time outstanding shall in no event exceed the Maximum
Amount of Credit.

     2.2.   Maximum Amount of Credit. The term "Maximum Amount of Credit" means,
on any date, the lesser of (a) $800,000 or (b) the amount (in an integral
multiple of $10,000) to which the then applicable amount set forth in clause (a)
above shall have been irrevocably reduced from time to time by notice from the
Company to the Lenders.

     2.3.   Borrowing Requests. The Company may from time to time request a loan
under Section 2.1 by providing to each applicable Lender a written notice at
least five (5) Banking Days prior to the requested Closing Date. Such notice
must specify the aggregate amount of the requested revolving loan (which shall
be not less than $100,000 and an integral multiple of $10,000), set forth each
applicable Lender's pro rata share of the requested revolving loan determined in
accordance with Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 hereto, as applicable, and be in
substantially the form of Exhibit 5.1 (a "Borrowing Request"). Each such loan
will be made by depositing the amount thereof to the general account of the
Company at Citizens Bank, or such other account at any bank of which the Company
has provided notice to each Lender.

     2.4.   Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the loans outstanding from
time to time under this Section 2 is referred to as the "Loan". The Company
shall keep a record of the Loan and shall include a copy of such record in each
Borrowing Request delivered to the applicable Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3.
The Company's obligations to pay the Loan shall be evidenced by the Company's
notes in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.4 (the "Notes"), payable to the
Lenders.

     2.5.   Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the sale by the Company of the
Notes hereunder shall be used for general corporate purposes and to pay closing
costs.

3.   Interest; Commitment Fees, etc.

     3.1.   Interest. The Loan shall accrue and bear interest at a rate per
annum which shall at all times equal the Base Rate. The Company will pay the
accrued and unpaid interest on the Loan on each Payment Date and on any stated
or accelerated maturity of the Loan to each Lender on the basis of the principal
amount owing to such Lender as of such date.

     3.2.   Unused Line Fee. Until the full performance and irrevocable payment
in full of the Loan and the termination date of this Agreement (the "End Date"),
the Company shall pay to the Lenders, on a pro rata basis as set forth on
Schedule 4 hereto, an unused line fee (the "Unused Line Fee") in an amount equal
to 1.5% of the difference derived by subtracting (a) the daily average amount of
the balances under the Loan outstanding during the preceding month, from (b) the
Maximum Amount of Credit (the "Unused Line"); provided; however; that if the
Unused Line is equal to or less than $300,000 for a given month, only the
Tranche II Lenders shall be entitled to receive the Unused Line Fee, and in such
event the Company shall pay to the Tranche II Lenders the Unused Line Fee on a
pro rata basis as set forth on Schedule 3 hereto. The Unused Line Fee shall be
payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each successive calendar month
(starting with the month in which the Initial Closing Date occurs). The Unused
Line Fee shall be prorated for the month in which the Initial Closing Date
occurs and the month in which the End Date occurs.

     3.3.   Default Rate. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this
Agreement or any other Credit Document to the contrary, for each day during any
period that there shall have occurred and be continuing any Event of Default,
the interest rate on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan shall be increased
to a rate per annum (the "Default Rate") which is equal to the Base Rate plus
two percent (2.00%).

     3.4.   Computations of Interest. For purposes of this Agreement, interest
(and any amount expressed as interest) shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year.

     3.5.   Warrants. As additional consideration for the extensions of credit
hereunder and as more fully described in the Warrant Agreement, the Company
shall issue and deliver to the Lenders, on a pro rata basis as set forth on
Schedule 5 hereto, on the Initial Closing Date, Warrants to purchase an
aggregate amount of shares of Common Stock equal to (a) the Maximum Amount of
Credit multiplied by ten percent (10%) and (b) divided by the Closing Price. The
Warrants shall be exercisable at a price per share equal to 1.25 multiplied by
the Closing Price and shall bear an expiration date of ten (10) years from the
Initial Closing Date. The Warrants shall be subject to various rights in favor
of the holders thereof as set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

4.   Payment.

     4.1. Payment at Maturity. On the Final Maturity Date, the Company will pay

       8.2.   Certain Actions Following an Event of Default. If any one or more
Events of Default shall occur and be continuing, then in each and every such
case:

              8.2.1. No Obligation to Extend Credit; Acceleration. Upon notice
       by a Majority of Lenders to the Company, the obligations of the Lenders
       to make any extension of credit hereunder shall automatically terminate
       and the Credit Obligations shall become immediately due and payable.

              8.2.2. Exercise of Rights. Any of the Lenders may proceed to
       protect and enforce their rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or
       other appropriate proceeding, either for specific performance of any
       covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Credit
       Document.

              8.2.3. Bankruptcy Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
       Default under Section 8.1.8, the unpaid balance of the Credit Obligations
       shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

              8.2.4. Setoff. Each Lender may offset and apply toward the payment
       of such balance or part thereof (and/or toward the curing of any Event of
       Default) any indebtedness from such Lender to the Company, regardless of
       the adequacy of any security for the Credit Obligations, and the Lenders
       shall have no duty to determine the adequacy of any such security in
       connection with any such offset.

              8.2.5. Cumulative Remedies. To the extent not prohibited by
       applicable law that cannot be waived, all of the Lenders' rights
       hereunder and under each other Credit Document shall be cumulative.

       8.3.   Waivers. The Company hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law:

                     (a) all presentments, demands for performance, notices of
              nonperformance (except to the extent required by the provisions of
              this Agreement or any other Credit Document), protests, notices of
              protest and notices of dishonor;

                     (b) any requirement of diligence or promptness on the part
              of any Lender in the enforcement of its rights under this
              Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document; and

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

                     (c) any and all notices of every kind and description which
              may be required to be given by any statute or rule of law.

9.     Expense Indemnity.

       9.1.   Expenses. The Company will pay: (a) all transfer and documentary
stamp and similar taxes at any time payable in respect of this Agreement or the
Loan and (b) all other reasonable expenses incurred by the Lenders in connection
with the enforcement of any rights hereunder or under any other Credit Document
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, including costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

       9.2.   General Indemnity. The Company shall indemnify each Lender and
each such Lender's employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and consultants
(each Lender and each of such employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and
consultants is referred to as an "Indemnified Party") and hold each of them
harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities and
reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel with
whom any Indemnified Party may consult in connection therewith and all
reasonable expenses of litigation or preparation therefor) which any Indemnified
Party may incur or which may be asserted against any Indemnified Party in
connection with (a) the Indemnified Party's compliance with or contest of any
subpoena or other process issued against it in any proceeding involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their affiliates, (b) any litigation or
investigation involving the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
affiliates, or any officer, director or employee thereof, (c) the existence or
exercise of any security rights with respect to the collateral under the Credit
Documents, or (d) this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity
shall not apply to litigation commenced by the Company against a Lender that
seeks enforcement of any of the rights of the Company hereunder or under any
other Credit Document and is determined adversely to such Lender in a final
nonappealable judgment or to the extent such claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses result from the Indemnified Party's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

10.    Successors and Assigns. Any reference in this Agreement to any of the
parties hereto shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such
party, and all covenants and agreements by or on behalf of the Company or each
Lender that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit
of their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the Company
may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement under any
circumstances and each Lender may assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement only as follows: each Lender may from time to time grant
participations in its pro rata share of the Loan and its Note, or assign all or
part of its pro rata share of the Loan and its Note, upon such terms as such
Lender may determine, to affiliates of such Lender, to any other Lender or, with
the consent of the Company which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to banks or
financial institutions.

waiver of any of the Lenders' rights under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or with respect to the Credit Obligations. No delay or omission on the
part of any Lender in exercising any right under this Agreement or any other
Credit Document or with respect to the Credit Obligations shall operate as a

13.    Venue; Service of Process; Certain Waivers. Each of the Company and each
Lender:

                     (a) Irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of

              nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
              the District of Massachusetts for the purpose of any suit, action
              or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or
              any other Credit Document or the subject matter hereof or thereof;

                     (b) Waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law
              that cannot be waived, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
              as a defense or otherwise, in any such proceeding brought in any
              of the above-named courts, any claim that it is not subject
              personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that its property is
              exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that such
              proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
              such proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement or any other
              Credit Document, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not
              be enforced in or by such court;

                     (c) Consents to service of process in any such proceeding

              of process by registered or certified mail, return receipt
              requested, at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 11
              is reasonably calculated to give actual notice; and

                     (d) Waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law
              that cannot be waived any right it may have to claim or recover in
              any such proceeding any special, exemplary, punitive or
              consequential damages.

14.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE COMPANY AND

DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF

in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in certificates delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to have been material and relied on
by the Lenders, notwithstanding any investigation made by the Lenders, and shall
survive the execution and delivery to the Lenders hereof and thereof. The

validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, and any invalid or
unenforceable provision shall be modified so as to be enforced to the maximum
extent of its validity or enforceability. The headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit, alter or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents constitute the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all prior and current understandings and agreements,

counterparts which together shall constitute one instrument. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws (other than the
conflict of laws rules) of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
