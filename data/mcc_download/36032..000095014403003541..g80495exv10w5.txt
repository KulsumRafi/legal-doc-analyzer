                     ARTICLE I -- PURPOSE AND EFFECTIVE DATE

         I.1      TITLE. This Plan shall be known as the Regions Financial
Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (hereinafter referred to as
the "Plan").

         I.2      PURPOSE. The purpose of the Plan is to permit certain members
of management and highly compensated employees to receive retirement benefits
that supplement retirement benefits payable from the Regions Financial
Corporation Retirement Plan.

         I.3      EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING CONTRACTS.

         (a)      The effective date of this Plan shall be January 1, 1999.

         (b)      For Participants in the Plan as of December 31, 1998, the Plan
                  amends and restates -- in one document -- the terms of the
                  supplemental retirement contracts previously executed by and
                  between Regions Financial Corporation and each such
                  Participant. By participating in this Plan, each such
                  Participant in the Plan as of December 31, 1998, agrees that
                  such supplemental retirement contract shall cease to have any
                  force or effect as of January 1, 1999, and that such
                  Participant's rights to supplemental retirement benefits on
                  and after January 1, 1999, whether accrued before or after
                  January 1, 1999, will be determined exclusively by the terms
                  of this document, as amended from time to time.

         (c)      For Participants who first enter the Plan on or after January
                  1, 1999, each such Participant agrees that, by participating
                  in this Plan and accruing benefits hereunder, any benefits
                  paid under this Plan as a result of a Change of Control that
                  is not a Merger of Equals shall supersede and be in lieu of
                  any and all benefits that would otherwise be payable under any
                  Change of Control Agreement between the Participant and the
                  Company. For this purpose, the term "Change of Control
                  Agreement" shall mean any agreement entitled a Change of
                  Control Agreement or otherwise designated by the Company's
                  Incumbent Board (as defined in Section 2.3) as a Change of
                  Control Agreement.

         ARTICLE II - DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLAN DOCUMENT

         II.1     BENEFICIARY. "Beneficiary" shall mean the person or persons or
the estate of a Participant entitled to receive any benefits under this Plan.

         II.2     BOARD. "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of Regions
Financial Corporation.

<PAGE>

         II.3     CHANGE OF CONTROL. A "Change of Control" means any of the
following:

                  (i)      an acquisition (other than directly from the Company)
         of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by
         any "Person" (as the term person is used for the purposes of Section
         13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
         "Exchange Act")) immediately after which such Person has beneficial
         ownership (within the meaning of Rule l3d-3 promulgated under the
         Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the
         Company's then-outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in
         determining whether or not a Change of Control has occurred, Voting
         Securities which are acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as
         hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would
         constitute a Change of Control. A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean
         (A) an acquisition by (A) any employee benefit plan (or related trust)
         sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company,
         (B) by the Company or (C) any Person in connection with a Non-Control
         Transaction (as hereinafter defined).

                  (ii)     individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute
         the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at
         least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual
         becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or
         nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by
         a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
         Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a
         member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any
         such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result
         of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the
         election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened
         solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other
         than the Board; or

                  (iii)    The consummation of:

                           (A) A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or
                  into the Company in which securities of the Company are
                  issued, unless such merger, consolidation or reorganization is
                  a "Non-Control Transaction". A "Non-Control Transaction" is a
                  merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the
                  Company or in which securities of the Company are issued
                  where:

                                    (I)      the stockholders of the Company
                           immediately before such merger, consolidation, or
                           reorganization, own, directly or indirectly, at least
                           fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power
                           of the outstanding voting securities of the
                           corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation
                           or reorganization (the "Surviving Corporation") in
                           substantially the same proportion as their ownership
                           of the Voting Securities immediately before such
                           merger, consolidation or reorganization,


                                       2

<PAGE>

                                    (II)     the individuals who were members of
                           the Board immediately prior to the execution of the
                           agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or
                           reorganization constitute at least a majority of the
                           members of the board of directors of the Surviving
                           Corporation or a corporation owning directly or
                           indirectly fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the
                           Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation, and

                                    (III)    no person other than (i) the
                           Company, (ii) any subsidiary, (iii) any employee
                           benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof)
                           maintained immediately prior to such merger,
                           consolidation, or reorganization by the Company owns
                           fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting
                           power of the Surviving Corporation's then-outstanding
                           voting securities;

                           (B)      A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
                  Company; or

                           (C)      The sale or other disposition of all or
                  substantially all of the assets of the Company to any Person.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not
         be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person")
         acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the
         outstanding Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Voting
         Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Voting
         Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
         Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a Change of
         Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) and after
         such acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company, the Subject
         Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting
         Securities, then a Change of Control shall occur.

         II.4     COMMITTEE. "Committee" means the Compensation Committee of the
Board.

         II.5     COMPANY. "Company" shall mean Regions Financial Corporation
and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. The term "Company" shall also
mean any successor to Regions Financial Corporation by way of merger, asset
purchase, or any other business combination.

         II.6     EXECUTIVE. "Executive" shall mean any member of management or
highly compensated employee who is eligible to participate in the Company's
Retirement Plan.

         II.7     GENDER AND NUMBER. Wherever the context so requires, masculine
pronouns include the feminine and singular words shall include the plural.

         II.8     NAMED FIDUCIARY. "Named Fiduciary", for purposes of the claims
procedure of this


                                       3

Plan, shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board.

         II.9     MERGER OF EQUALS. The term "Merger of Equals" shall mean any
Change of Control transaction approved by the Company's Incumbent Board (as
defined in Section 2.3 above) and specifically designated by the Incumbent Board
as a merger of equals.

         II.10    PARTICIPANT. "Participant" means an Executive who is
participating in the Plan pursuant to a resolution of the Committee.

         II.11    PLAN. "Plan" means this Regions Financial Corporation
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, as in effect from time to time.

portion or provision of this Plan document.

Company agrees to pay each Participant the following amounts:

                  (A)      RETIREMENT. If the Participant remains in the employ
         of the Company until attainment of normal retirement age ("Retirement

                                    Credited Service, as the case may be, will
                                    be recognized for purposes of calculating
                                    the Participant's benefit under this Step 1.

                           STEP 2. From the amount determined in Step 1,
                                    subtract an amount equal to whichever of the
                                    following is applicable:

                                    (i)      for Participants in the Plan as of

                                             Plan assuming payment in the form
                                             of a joint and 50% survivor
                                             annuity; or,

                                    (ii)     for Participants first entering the
                                             Plan on or after January 1, 1999,
                                             the monthly benefit payable at the
                                             time of determination under the
                                             Retirement Plan -- to the extent
                                             attributable to service with the
                                             Company -- assuming payment in the

                                    subtract an amount equal to the monthly
                                    joint and 50% survivor annuity benefit
                                    option then available to such Participant

                                    Insurance Program ("ELIP"), if any, in
                                    effect as of the date of the Participant's
                                    retirement, after excluding the amount of
                                    any recovery by the Company (or the trustee
                                    of any trust established to provide benefits
                                    under the Plan) of amounts that are owed to
                                    the Company or trustee (hereinafter
                                    collectively referred to as the "Payee")
                                    under the ELIP. For purposes of the
                                    preceding sentence, the Payee shall be
                                    deemed to be owed, as of the Participant's
                                    date of retirement, an amount equal to the
                                    total amount of premiums that the Company
                                    has paid under the ELIP, regardless of
                                    whether the Payee is in fact entitled to
                                    recover such premium payments at the time of
                                    the Participant's retirement. Cash values
                                    accumulated under any ELIP shall be
                                    converted to comparable joint and 50%
                                    annuity amounts using the actuarial
                                    equivalence factors applicable under the
                                    Retirement Plan as of the date on which this
                                    Step 3 is applied or such other reasonable
                                    actuarial factors as are specified by the
                                    Committee.

                  Payments will be made to the Participant as long as he shall
         live; after the Participant's death, one-half of the benefit will be
         continued to the Participant's spouse, if then living, for as long as
         she shall live. At the sole discretion of the Company, a lump sum
         payment of the Participant's entire benefit may be made to the
         Participant. The lump sum benefit shall be computed by using the 1983
         Group Annuity Mortality Table (applied on a 100% male and 0% female
         unisex basis) and an interest rate equal to the average monthly rate on
         30-year U.S. Treasury securities as reported in the Federal Reserve
         Statistical Release for the month prior to the participant's separation
         from employment with the Company.

                  (B)      DISABILITY. If, prior to Retirement Age, the
         Participant becomes totally and permanently disabled as a result of
         injury or sickness while employed by the Company, and such total
         disability prevents the Participant from performing all of the
         substantial and material duties of his employment with the Company, the
         Company agrees to pay the Participant monthly payments equal to the
         amount that the Participant would have been entitled to receive under
         Section 4.1(A) of this Plan as of his Retirement Age had he remained in
         the employ of the Company from the date of onset of his disability to
         his Retirement Age at the same rate of average monthly compensation in
         effect as of the date of onset of his disability, less any benefits
         payable under the Employer's group long term disability plan and any
         additional benefits which would have been payable under the group long
         term disability plan if the Participant had elected to purchase the
         maximum amount of coverage available under such plan. The Company will
         continue the monthly payments for the duration of the Participant's
         disability or until the Participant's attainment of Retirement Age,
         whichever occurs first. If attainment of Retirement Age occurs first,
         the Participant's benefit under this Plan shall be recalculated under
         Section 4.1(A) (modified, as appropriate, by this paragraph B), in
         order to take into account the offsets under Steps 2 and 3 of Section
         4.1(A).

                  (C)      EARLY RETIREMENT. If the Participant has attained age
         55 he may retire early and receive the benefit that he has accrued
         under Steps 1, 2, and 3 of Section 4.1(A) as of his early retirement
         date based on average monthly compensation and years of employment or
         years of Credited Service (whichever is applicable) as of such early
         retirement date.

                  (D)      DEATH.

                  (1)      If, prior to Retirement Age, the Participant dies
                           while actively employed by Company, the Company shall
                           make monthly payments to the Participant's spouse, if
                           then living, beginning on the first day of the month
                           following the Participant's death and continuing as
                           long as she lives. The amount of such monthly
                           payments shall equal the benefit that would have been
                           payable to the Participant under Section 4.1(A) of
                           this Plan if the Participant had (i) continued in the
                           employ of the Company until his Retirement Age at the
                           same rate of average compensation in effect as of the
                           date of his death (ii) thereafter immediately retired
                           with a joint and 50% survivor annuity form of
                           payment, and (iii), thereafter immediately died.

                  (2)      If, prior to Retirement Age, the Participant dies
                           while receiving disability payments pursuant to
                           Section 4.1(B) above, the Company shall make monthly
                           payments to the Participant's spouse, if then living,
                           beginning on the first day of the month following the
                           Participant's death and continuing as long as she
                           lives. The amount of such monthly payments shall be
                           50% of the monthly benefit that was being paid to the
                           Participant as of the date of his death.

                  (E)      CERTAIN TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. If, prior to the
         Participant's attaining age 55, the Company terminates the
         Participant's employment for any reason other than Cause (as defined in
         Section 9.1(B)(1) below), the Company agrees to pay the Participant,
         commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next
         following the month in which the Participant attains age 55, the
         monthly benefit that the Participant accrued under Steps 1, 2, and 3 of
         Section 4.1(A) as of the date of his termination of employment, based
         on average monthly compensation and years of employment or Credited
         Service (whichever is applicable) as of such date.

         IV.2     PAYMENT CONDITIONS. The payment of benefits to the Participant
or his designated recipient(s) under this Agreement is conditioned upon the
following:

                  (A)      Participant's non-breach of the provisions of any
         employment agreement in effect between the Participant and the Company,
         including, but not limited to, any non-competition provisions thereof.

                 ARTICLE VIII -- NATURE OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATION

         VIII.1   COMPANY'S OBLIGATION.

         (a)      The Company's obligations under this Agreement shall be an
                  unfunded and unsecured promise to pay. The Company shall not
                  be obligated under any circumstances to fund its obligations
                  under this Agreement. The Company may, however, as its sole
                  and exclusive option, elect to fund this Agreement in whole or
                  in part. If the Company shall elect to fund this Agreement, in
                  whole or in part, the manner of such funding, and the
                  continuance or discontinuance of such funding shall be the
                  sole and exclusive decision of the Company. Any payments to
                  Participant from such a funding source -- for example, a
                  grantor-type trust commonly known as a rabbi trust -- shall
                  fully discharge, to the extent thereof, the Company's
                  obligations under the Plan.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
                  Section 8.1, upon the retirement (regardless of whether a
                  normal, early, or disability retirement) of a person who first
                  became a Participant in the Plan on or after January 1, 1999,
                  the Company shall, as soon as is practicable following the
                  date of retirement, make a lump sum contribution to the trust
                  created under that certain trust agreement (hereinafter called
                  the "Rabbi Trust") dated November 9, 1993, as amended, in an
                  amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the discounted
                  present value of all benefits projected to be payable under
                  the Plan to all such Participants who have retired or who are
                  no longer employed by the Company over (ii) the fair market
                  value of assets in the Rabbi Trust as of the date of such
                  Participant's retirement.

         VIII.2   CREDITOR STATUS. Any assets which the Company may acquire or
set aside to help cover its financial liabilities are and must remain general
assets of the Company subject to the claims of its creditors. Neither the
Company nor this Plan gives the Participant any beneficial ownership interest in
any asset of the Company. All rights of ownership in any such assets are and
remain in the Company.

                   ARTICLE IX -- CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS

         IX.1     ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ON CHANGE OF CONTROL. This Section 9.1
provides for additional payments under the Plan upon certain terminations of
employment occurring within certain time frames following a Change of Control
that is not a Merger of Equals. No benefit payable under the Plan by reason of
any other Section of the Plan shall be considered contingent upon a Change of
Control that is not a Merger of Equals. The only provisions of the Plan that
provide for payments contingent upon a Change of Control that is not a Merger of
Equals are

contained in this Article IX.

         (A)      If the Participant's employment with the Company shall be
                  terminated within the 24 month period following a Change of
                  Control that is not a Merger of Equals for reasons other than
                  (a) by the Company for Cause or Disability, (b) by reason of
                  the Participant's death, or (c), by the Participant other than
                  for Good Reason, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
                  a lump sum payment within 30 days of his termination of
                  employment equal to the excess, if any, of (a) two hundred and
                  ninety nine percent (299%) of the Participant's base amount
                  under Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
                  1986 (the "Code"), as amended, calculated as of the date of
                  the Participant's termination of employment, over (b), the
                  total of all payments (discounted to a present value if made
                  over time) from the Company that constitute payments in the
                  nature of compensation required to be taken into account under
                  Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) when determining whether the
                  Participant owes any excise tax under Code Section 4999.

         (B)      For purposes of Section 9.1(A) above, the following phrases
                  shall have the following meanings:

                  (1)      "Cause" shall mean:

                           (a)      the willful and continued failure of the
                                    Participant to perform substantially the
                                    Participant's reasonably assigned duties
                                    with the Company (other than any such
                                    failure resulting from incapacity due to
                                    physical or mental illness or from the
                                    assignment to the Participant of duties with
                                    the Company that would constitute Good
                                    Reason), which failure continued for a
                                    period of at least thirty (30) days after a
                                    written demand for substantial performance,
                                    signed by a duly authorized officer of the
                                    Company, has been delivered to the
                                    Participant specifying the manner in which
                                    the Participant has failed substantially to
                                    perform, or

                           (b)      the willful engaging by the Participant in
                                    illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is
                                    materially and demonstrably injurious to the
                                    Company; provided, however, that no
                                    termination of the Participant's employment
                                    shall be for Cause as set forth in this
                                    Section 9.1(B)(1) until (i) there shall have
                                    been delivered to the Participant a copy of
                                    a written notice, signed by a duly
                                    authorized officer of the Company, setting
                                    forth that the Participant was guilty of the
                                    conduct described in this Section 9.1(B)(1)
                                    and specifying the particulars thereof in
                                    detail, and (ii) the Participant shall have
                                    been provided an opportunity to be heard in
                                    person by the Board.

                                    For purposes of this provision, no act or
                                    failure to act, on the part of the
                                    Participant, shall be considered "willful"
                                    unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by
                                    the Participant in bad faith or without
                                    reasonable belief that the Participant's
                                    action or omission was in the best interests
                                    of the Company. Any act, or failure to act,
                                    based upon authority given pursuant to a
                                    resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon

                                    for the Company shall be conclusively
                                    presumed to be done, or omitted to be done,
                                    by the Participant in good faith and in the
                                    best interests of the Company.
                                    Notwithstanding anything set forth in this
                                    Agreement to the contrary, no failure to
                                    perform by the Participant after a Notice of
                                    Termination is given to the Company by the
                                    Participant shall constitute Cause for the
                                    purposes of this Plan.

                  (2)      "Disability" shall mean that the Participant has
                           become eligible to participate in the Company's long
                           term disability plan.

                  (3)      "Good Reason" shall mean:

                           (a)      the occurrence, after a Change of Control
                                    that is not a Merger of Equals, of any of
                                    the following events or conditions:

                                    (i)      a change in the Participant's
                                             status, title, position or
                                             responsibilities (including
                                             reporting responsibilities) which,
                                             in the Participant's reasonable
                                             judgement, represents a materially
                                             adverse change from his status,
                                             title, position or responsibilities
                                             as in effect immediately prior
                                             thereto; the assignment to the
                                             Participant of any duties or
                                             responsibilities which, in the
                                             Participant's reasonable judgement,
                                             are materially inconsistent with
                                             his status, title, position,
                                             responsibilities; or any removal of
                                             the Participant from or failure to
                                             reappoint or reelect him to any
                                             such offices or positions, except
                                             in connection with the termination
                                             of employment of the Participant
                                             for Disability, Cause, as a result
                                             of the Participant's death or by
                                             the Participant other than for Good
                                             Reason;

                                    (ii)     a reduction in aggregate of the
                                             Participant's annual base salary
                                             and bonus below the aggregate of
                                             the Base Amount and the Bonus
