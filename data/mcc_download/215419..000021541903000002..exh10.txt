                   CHECKPOINT SYSTEMS, INC.
                  2002 CORPORATE BONUS PLAN


For 2002 the Board of Directors approved the 2002 Corporate Bonus Plan. The 2002
Corporate Bonus Plan provides for a Bonus Pool to be formed when earnings per
share ("EPS") increases over a defined target. The Bonus Pool is then
apportioned among four (4) groups of employees; corporate officers; vice
presidents, middle management, and front line employees. Each group has a
targeted bonus percentage assigned which is adjusted, depending on the
percentage increase or decrease over the targeted EPS growth. Other than for
Corporate Officers, whose bonuses are determined solely on the basis of
financial performance of the Company, all participants will have a percentage of
their bonuses determined by individual performance. No Bonus Pool will be formed
unless 2002 EPS attains a specified level. The specified minimum target for EPS
was not attained for the fiscal year 2002 and therefore no bonuses were paid.
