<PAGE>

          payable to the Sellers pursuant to Schedule 10.

4.4  The Completion Payment shall be satisfied by or on behalf of the Purchaser
     at Completion as referred to in paragraph 2.2 of Schedule 3.

4.5  Receipt by the Sellers' Solicitors of the Completion Payment in accordance

     respect of the payment of the Completion Payment.

5    Warranties
     ----------

5.1  Subject as provided in this Agreement, the Sellers jointly and severally
     warrant to the Purchaser as at the date of this Agreement in the terms set
     out in Schedule 4. All references in Schedule 4 to the Company shall unless
     the context otherwise requires be construed as references to each and every
     member of the Group.

5.2  The liability of the Sellers under or in relation to the Warranties and
     (where specified) the Tax Deed shall be limited as set out in Schedule 5.
     However, in the event of fraud or dishonesty on the part of any of the
     Sellers then the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 5 shall not
     apply in relation to any claim arising out of the subject matter of such
     fraud or dishonesty.

5.3  The Sellers accept that the Purchaser is entering into this Agreement in
     reliance upon the Warranties.

5.4  The Sellers undertake (if any claim is made against them in connection with
     the Warranties or the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser) not to make any
     claim against any member of the Group or any director or employee of any
     member of the Group on whom they may have relied before agreeing to any
     terms of this Agreement or of the Tax Deed or authorising any statement in
     the Disclosure Letter.

5.5  Each of the Warranties shall be construed as a separate and independent
     warranty and shall not be limited or restricted by reference to any other
     Warranty.

5.6  If in respect of or in connection with any breach of any of the Warranties
     or Indemnities any amount payable to the Purchaser by the Sellers is
     subject to Taxation, such additional amounts shall be paid to the Purchaser
     by the Sellers so as to ensure that the net amount received by the
     Purchaser is equal to the full amount payable to the Purchaser under this
     Agreement provided that the provisions of paragraph 1.1 of

                                       3

<PAGE>

     schedule 5 shall apply to claims made pursuant to this clause 5.6.

6    Indemnities
     -----------

     The Sellers agree to indemnify the Purchaser (for itself, and, for its
     successors in title) against all or any of the matters set out in this
     clause 6 ("the Indemnities").

6.1  Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 5, which provisions shall not
     apply to the indemnities contained in this clause 6.1 save as set out in
     clause 6.2, the Sellers jointly and severally covenant with the Purchaser
     that they will pay to the Purchaser:

     (a)  an amount equal to all liabilities (including for the avoidance of
          doubt all claims, demands, expenses and third party costs which are or
          become the liabilities) of any of the Company and/or the Subsidiary
          after Completion and which directly arise as a result of products
          and/or components which:

          (i)  the Group has before Completion committed to purchase from its
               suppliers, whether such items have been supplied to the Group,
               are yet to be supplied to the Group, are in transit, or are
               stored by or on behalf of the Group; or

          (ii) the Group has before Completion committed to supply to customers,
               whether such items have been supplied to the customer, are yet to
               be supplied to the customer, are in transit, or are stored by or
               on behalf of the customer;

     (b)  an amount equal to all liabilities, not compensated for by a relevant
          average rate option contract, (including for the avoidance of doubt
          all claims, demands, expenses, professional fees and other costs which
          are or become liabilities) of any of the Company and/or the Subsidiary
          and/or the Purchaser after Completion and which relate to the impact
          of movements in currency exchange rates (other than movements in the
          US dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate) on the profitability of
          the supply and/or the purchase by the Company and/or the Subsidiary of
          products and components which the Group has before Completion
          committed to supply and/or purchase;

     (c)  an amount equal to all liabilities to Thales Microelectronics SA or to
          companies connected to it ("Thales") arising from the supply by the
          Group of printed circuit boards manufactured by Printed Wire
          Corporation of Taiwan and sold by Thales to Wavecom SA, liabilities
          for the purpose of this indemnity shall for the avoidance of doubt
          include:

          (i)  all claims, demands, expenses, professional fees and other costs;

          (ii) increases in the insurance premiums payable in relation to the
               Acquired Businesses.

6.2  The provisions of paragraphs 2.1(b), 4.1, 4.3 and 3.1(f) of schedule 5 and
     clauses 6.3 to 6.8 shall apply to claims made by the Purchaser pursuant to
     this clause 6.

                                       4

<PAGE>

6.3  Save where the Purchaser reasonably believes that to do so would be likely
     to have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of any member of the
     Purchaser's Group, if requested in writing by the Sellers, and subject to
     the Purchaser being indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the
     Sellers against all associated costs and expenses, the Purchaser shall take
     all such action as the Seller may reasonably request to avoid dispute,
     resist, appeal or compromise any third party claim against the Company in
     relation to the subject matter of this clause 6.

6.4  Where the Company or the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group
     has or may have a claim against any third party, including insurers, in
     relation to any matter which is likely to give rise to a claim under this
     clause 6, the Purchaser shall (or shall procure that the Company or any
     member of the Purchaser's Group shall) use all reasonable endeavours to
     maximise the amounts recovered from such third party.

6.5  The Purchaser shall and shall procure that the Purchaser's Group shall use
     all reasonable endeavours, taking into account the interests of the
     Purchaser's Group as a whole, to minimise the amount of any payment which
     could result in a claim under the Indemnities.

6.6  The Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers are kept fully informed of,
     and are consulted in relation to, the progress of any relevant claims
     referred to in this clause 6.

6.7  The liability of the Sellers in relation to any claims pursuant to this
     clause 6 shall be limited to the recovery of amounts paid to the Sellers
     out of the Retention Sum and the recovery of any amounts paid as Deferred
     Consideration or by set off against the Retention Sum or the Deferred
     Consideration and not further or otherwise.

6.8  The Sellers shall have no liability pursuant to this clause 6, the
     Warranties or the Tax Deed to the extent that such liability is satisfied
     by permanent retention by the Purchaser of an amount of the Retention Sum
     or to the extent that such liability is taken into account in the
     calculation of the Deferred Consideration.

7    Restrictions on the Sellers
     ---------------------------

7.1  In order to protect the value of the Shares and the Acquired Businesses the
     Sellers severally undertake that they will not, either alone or in

          interested in the United Kingdom in any business which competes
          (directly or indirectly) with any of the Acquired Businesses provided
          that the restriction in this clause 7.1(a) shall not operate to
          prohibit the Sellers from continuing as employees of the Acquired
          Businesses;

     (b)  within two years from the Completion Date, entice away from the
          employment of any member of the Purchaser's Group any Key Employee or

<PAGE>

           during the preceding twelve months, employed or engaged by the
           Group as a Key Employee;

      (c)  disclose to any other person or (in any way which may be detrimental
           to the Acquired Businesses) use any information which is Confidential
           Business Information;

      (d)  for a period of two years after the Completion Date, solicit the
           custom, in relation to goods or services sold to any person (which,

           individual, firm, company, joint venture, association or partnership
           (whether or not having separate legal personality)) by any member of
           the Group in the course of its business during the two years before
           the Completion Date, of that person in respect of similar goods or
           services; or

      (e)  assist any person with the intention of doing any of the foregoing
           things.

8     Provision Relating to Restrictions
      ----------------------------------

8.1   Each undertaking contained in clause 7 shall be construed as a separate
      undertaking and if one or more of the undertakings is held to be against

      trade, the remaining undertakings shall continue to bind the Sellers.

9     Effect of Completion
      --------------------

9.1   Save as otherwise provided herein, any provision of this Agreement or of
      any other document referred to herein which is capable of being performed
      after but which has not been performed at or before Completion and all

10.2  The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by
      law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or further
      exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy

11    Assignment
      ----------

11.1  The benefits of this Agreement and the Tax Deed shall not be assignable
      except that the Purchaser may assign all or any part of the benefit of, or
      its rights or benefits under, this Agreement and the Tax Deed and any of
      the Share Purchase Documents referred to in clause 13 together with any
      causes of action arising in connection with them to its successors in
      title or a member of the Purchaser's Group or as security to any person
      lending money to a member of the Purchaser's Group (a "Permitted
      Assignee"), Provided that if the Permitted Assignee is a member of the
      Purchaser's Group and is proposing to leave the Purchaser's Group, then
      the Purchaser shall procure that the Permitted Assignee re-assigns the
      aforementioned benefits to a continuing member of the Purchaser's Group
      prior to its departure from the Purchaser's Group.

11.2  The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 shall not apply to this
      Agreement and no person (including any employee, officer, agent,
      representative or sub-contractor of a party) other than a party to this
      Agreement shall have the right (whether under that act or otherwise) to
      enforce any term of this Agreement which expressly or by implication
      confers a benefit on that person without the express prior agreement in
      writing of the Sellers and the Buyer, which agreement must refer to this
      clause 11.2.

11.3  If a Permitted Assignee makes a claim against the Sellers under any
      provision of this Agreement then the liability of the Sellers to the
      Permitted Assignee shall not exceed the amount (if any) for which they
      would have been liable to the Purchaser.

12    Further Assurance
      -----------------

12.1  Without prejudice to any restriction or limitation on the extent of the
      Sellers' obligations under this Agreement the Sellers shall from time to
      time do or so far as they are able procure the doing of all such acts
      and/or execute or so far as they are able procure the execution of all
      such documents in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser as the
      Purchaser may reasonably consider necessary to transfer the Shares to the
      Purchaser or otherwise to give the Purchaser the full benefit of this
      Agreement.

12.2  Each Seller declares that for so long as he or she remains the registered
      holder of any of the Shares after Completion he or she shall:

      (a)   hold the Shares and the dividends and other distributions of profits
            or surplus or other assets declared, paid or made in respect of them
            after Completion and all rights arising out of or in connection with
            them in trust for the Purchaser and any successors in title to the
            Purchaser; and

      (b)   deal with and dispose of the Shares and all such dividends,
            distributions and related rights as the Purchaser or any such
            successor may direct.

12.3  Each Seller appoints the Purchaser as his or her lawful attorney for the
      purpose of signing any written resolution (or receiving notices of
      attending and voting at all meetings) of the members of the Company from
      Completion to the day on which the Purchaser or its nominee is entered in
      the register of members of the Company as the

                                       7

<PAGE>

      holder of the Shares and for that purpose each Seller authorises:

      (a)   the Company to send any written resolutions, notices or other
            communications in respect of his or her holding of Shares to the
            Purchaser; and

      (b)   the Purchaser to complete in such manner as it thinks fit and to
            return written resolutions, proxy cards, consents to short notice
            and any other document required to be signed by him or her in his or
            her capacity as a member.

13    Entire Agreement
      ----------------

13.1  For the purposes of this clause, "Pre-contractual Statement" means a
      draft, agreement, undertaking, representation, warranty, promise,
      assurance or arrangement of any nature whatsoever, whether or not in
      writing, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and any other
      document to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement (the "Share
      Purchase Documents") or any of them made or given by a party to any of the
      Share Purchase Documents or any other person at any time prior to the date
      of this Agreement.

13.2  The Share Purchase Documents constitute the whole and only agreement
      between the parties relating to the sale and purchase of the Shares.

13.3  The Share Purchase Documents supersede and extinguish any Pre-contractual

<PAGE>

      to claim indemnity against any loss or damage suffered by it arising out
      of the subject matter thereof under the terms of any insurance policy for
      the time being in force, the Purchaser shall at the request of the
      Sellers' Representative, subject to the Sellers indemnifying and securing
      the Purchaser and/or any member(s) of the Group to the Purchaser's
      reasonable satisfaction against any liability, costs, damages or expenses
      (including, without limitation, increased premiums) which may be incurred,
      procure that all such steps are taken to enforce recovery and, if any sum
      is so recovered, then either:

      (a)   the amount payable by the Sellers in respect of such claim shall be
            reduced by an amount equal to the sum recovered less all reasonable
            costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Purchaser and/or any
            member(s) of the Group in recovering that sum under the terms of the
            insurance policy; or

      (b)   (if any amount shall already have been paid by the Sellers in
            respect of such claim) there shall be repaid to the Sellers'
            Represenative an amount equal to the amount recovered or (if less)
            the amount of such payment less all reasonable costs, charges and
            expenses incurred by the Purchaser and/or the relevant member of the
            Group in recovering that sum from such other person,

      PROVIDED THAT:

      (a)   nothing in this paragraph shall oblige the Purchaser and/or any
            member of the Group to take such steps prior to making a claim or
            recovering from the Sellers under the Warranties; and

      (b)   to the extent that any such amount recovered from insurers does not
            cover the entire loss, the Purchaser shall subject to the other
            provisions of this Agreement, be entitled to recover the shortfall
            from the Sellers up to the full extent of their liability under this
            Agreement.

10    Conduct of claims
      -----------------

10.1  Without prejudice to the validity of any claim notified in accordance with
      the time limits set out in paragraph 2.1, if the Purchaser becomes aware
      of any fact, matter or circumstance which is likely to give rise to a
      claim under the Warranties, the Purchaser shall give notice of such fact,
      matter or circumstance to the Sellers as soon as reasonably practicable
      and in any event within 20 Business Days of becoming aware of any such
      fact, matter or circumstance.

10.2  If any claim is made against the Purchaser or any member of the
      Purchaser's Group by any third party which is likely to in turn lead to a
      claim by the Purchaser against the Sellers under the Warranties then the
      Purchaser shall:

      (a)   keep the Sellers informed as to the progress of any such claim and
            shall procure that the Sellers are sent copies of key communications
            and other documents (written or otherwise) transmitted to any other
            party to any proceedings or their agents or professional advisers
            (including, without

                                       50

<PAGE>

      limitation, pleadings and any opinion of counsel relating to any
      proceedings against any third parties);

      (b)   save where the Purchaser reasonably believes that to do so would
            have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of any member of the
            Purchaser's Group, subject to the Purchaser and the relevant member
            of the Purchaser's Group being entitled to employ its own legal
            advisers and being indemnified and secured to its reasonable
            satisfaction by the Sellers against all liabilities, costs,
            expenses, damages and losses (including, without limitation, the
            costs of its legal advisers) suffered or incurred in connection with
            any such claim, take, and shall procure that each member of the
            Purchaser's Group shall take, all reasonable steps so as to recover
            or minimise or resolve such liability or dispute; and

      (c)   save where the Purchaser reasonably believes that to do so would
            have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of any member of the
            Purchaser's Group, it shall, and shall procure that each member of
            the Purchaser's Group shall:

            (i)   comply with all reasonable requests of the Sellers in relation
                  to such claim including (without limitation) giving the
                  Sellers reasonable access to premises, personnel, documents
                  and records for the purpose of investigating the matters
                  giving rise to such claim; and

            (ii)  not settle or compromise such claim without the prior written
                  consent of the Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably
                  withheld or delayed).

                                   SCHEDULE 9
                                   ----------

             (Payment of the Retention Sum and the Debt Adjustment)
             ------------------------------------------------------

1        The Retention Sum and the Debt Adjustment referred to in clause 3.1(b)
         shall, unless the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative otherwise
         agree, only be paid in accordance with the provisions hereof.

2
2.1      No later than 45 days from the Completion Date, the Purchaser shall
         procure that the Purchaser's Auditors prepare and deliver to the
         Sellers' Representative a statement (the "DEBT STATEMENT") of the
         actual aggregate amount at 30 September 2002 of the assumed liabilities
         which are listed in Schedule 7 which has been calculated in accordance
         with the accounting policies adopted by the Company in the preparation
         of the Accounts (the "FINAL DEBT AMOUNT").

         For  the purposes of the preparation of the Debt Statement the
         following exchange rates are agreed:

         Euros to pound sterling            1.59:1

         US dollars to pound sterling       1.56:1

2.2      The Sellers shall as soon as possible review the Debt Statement and,
         within 15 Business Days of receipt, the Sellers' Representative shall
         confirm to the Purchaser's Auditors whether or not he agrees with the
         Debt Statement, giving written details of any matters in dispute.

2.3      If the Sellers' Representative confirms his agreement with the Debt
         Statement (either as presented to him or as modified in such manner as
         he and the Purchaser shall agree) subject to paragraph 3 below, the
         Debt Statement shall be final and binding on the parties to this
         Agreement.

2.4      If the Sellers' Representative is unable to agree with part or all of
         the Debt Statement, and if such matter remains unresolved for a period
         of 5 Business Days after the end of the 15 Business Day period set out
         in paragraph 2.2 above, any matter in dispute may be referred by either
         the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative to the Independent
         Auditors for determination. The Independent Auditors shall act as
         experts and not as arbitrators.

2.5      The Independent Auditors shall be requested to make and communicate
         their decision to the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser within
         30 days of appointment and it shall be final and binding on the parties
         to this Agreement (in the absence of manifest error) for the purposes
         of this Agreement.

2.6      Following settlement of any such matter which the Sellers'
         Representative shall have disputed (whether settled under paragraph 2.4
         above or otherwise by agreement between the Sellers' Representative and
         the Purchaser), the Final Debt Amount shall be finalised in accordance
         with that settlement and subject to paragraph 3 below, the

                                       56

<PAGE>

         resulting Debt Statement and Final Debt Amount shall be final and
         binding on the parties to this Agreement.

2.7      The total amount of the difference between the Assumed Liabilities and
         the Final Debt Amount, shall be the "DEBT ADJUSTMENT".

2.8      The Sellers and the Purchaser shall give the Purchaser's Auditors or
         the Independent Auditors, as the case may be, full access (upon
         reasonable notice during Working Hours) to those books of account,
         documents, files and papers which the requesting party or firm may
         reasonably require to prepare or review the Debt Statement and/or
         determine whether the Debt Statement has been prepared in accordance
         with the provisions of this Schedule 9.

2.9      The charges of the Independent Auditors shall be shared equally by the
         Purchaser and the Sellers unless the Independent Auditors shall
         determine otherwise. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall be liable for
         any accounting charges incurred by their own respective advisers.

3

3.1      If the Final Debt Amount is greater than the Assumed Liabilities but
         the Debt Adjustment is less than (pound)500,000 then the amount of the
         Debt Adjustment will be retained by the Purchaser from the Retention
         Sum and the balance of the Retention Sum (less any sums agreed or
         determined to be paid by the Sellers pursuant to the Indemnities or the
         Warranties or the Tax Deed and subject to the provisions of paragraph 7
         below) shall be paid to the Sellers on the date which falls 10 Business
         Days after Agreement of the Debt Adjustment.

3.2      If the Final Debt Amount is greater than the Assumed Liabilities and
         the Debt Adjustment is more than (pound)500,000 then the Retention Sum
         shall be retained by the Purchaser and the Sellers shall account to the
         Purchaser on the date which falls 10 Business Days after agreement of
         the Debt Statement for an amount equivalent to the amount by which the
         Debt Adjustment exceeds (pound)500,000.

3.3      If the Final Debt Amount is less than the Assumed Liabilities then the
         Retention Sum (but less any sums agreed or determined to be paid by the
         Sellers pursuant to the Indemnities or the Warranties or the Tax Deed
         and subject to the provisions of paragraph 7 below), shall be paid by
         the Purchaser to the Sellers on the date which falls 10 Business Days
         after agreement of the Debt Statement.

4        Any sums payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to this
         Schedule shall be paid by electronic funds transfer to the Sellers'
         Solicitors Account and receipt into the Sellers' Solicitors Account of
         such sums shall constitute a good discharge to the Purchaser in respect
         of such payment and the Purchaser shall have no responsibility for the
         distribution of such sums between the Sellers.

5        If any part of the Retention Sum and the Debt Adjustment (if
         applicable) is not payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to
         this Schedule then the Purchaser

                                       57

<PAGE>

         shall cease forthwith to have any liability to pay such sums to the
         Sellers and the Sellers shall have no right of action to claim such
         sums from the Purchaser.

6        If any sums are paid to the Purchaser pursuant to this schedule 9 then
         the Sellers shall cease forthwith to have any liability to pay such
         sums to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall have no right of action
         to claim such sums from the Sellers.

7        If any aspect of the matters which are subject of the indemnity at
         clause 6.1(c) have not been resolved or settled prior to the date of
         any payments to the Sellers in accordance with the provisions of
         paragraphs 3.1 or 3.3 of this schedule then the amount of the Retention
         Sum otherwise payable to the Sellers shall be retained by the Purchaser
         pending such resolution or settlement, provided that such part of the
         Retention Sum shall be released from time to time as is in excess of
         the maximum amount of the potential liability pursuant to clause 6.1(c)
         in particular it is agreed that:

         (i)      upon the settlement or resolution of any claim by Thales
                  against the Company or the Subsidiary that no more than
                  (pound)234,000 shall be retained in the Retention Sum in
                  respect of any pending claim by Wavecom SA arising from the
                  subject matter of the indemnity at clause 6.1(c): and

         (ii)     if no legal proceedings in respect of a claim by Wavecom SA
                  against Thales have been commenced (by being both issued and
                  served) within three years of the date of this Agreement, it
                  shall be assumed that no such claim from Wavecom SA is pending
                  and that there is no potential liability in this respect for
                  the purposes of this schedule 9.

2.10     The Purchaser and the Sellers shall share the charges of the
         Independent Auditors equally unless the Independent Auditors shall
         determine otherwise. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall be liable for
         any accounting charges incurred by their own respective advisers.

3        The EBITDA Adjustment (if any) for the relevant Adjustment Period (less
         any sums agreed or determined to be paid by the Sellers pursuant to the
         Indemnities or the Warranties or the Tax Deed), shall be paid by the
         Purchaser to the Sellers on the date which falls 10 Business Days after

4        Any sums payable by the Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to this
         Schedule shall be paid by electronic funds transfer to the Sellers'
         Solicitors Account and receipt into the Sellers' Solicitors Account of

5        In order to maximise the amount of the EBITDA for each of the
         Adjustment Periods the Sellers and the Purchaser undertake that they
         shall:

         (a)      co-operate to ensure that the Acquired Businesses are promptly
                  and efficiently integrated with the operations of DDi
                  International Limited (together the "Integrated Business")

         (b)      not do or fail to do anything the consequence or effect of
                  which act or failure to act would be in any manner materially
                  and adversely to affect the ability of the Integrated Business
                  to carry out its business in substantially the same manner in
                  which such business has previously been conducted; and

         (c)      act in good faith to comply in all material respects with the
                  Integrated Business plan.

6        Until the expiry of the Adjustment Periods the Purchaser agrees that
         the Sellers shall manage the business of the Integrated Business and
         the Purchaser shall not and shall procure that no member of the
         Purchaser's Group shall (except as expressly provided to the contrary
         in this agreement or with the prior consent of the Sellers) take any
         steps which:

         (a)      are inconsistent with the maintenance of the Integrated
                  Business and its businesses as an independent operation;

         (b)      are artificial or prejudicial to the interests of the Sellers;
                  or

         (c)      outside the ordinary course of business, may diminish or
                  adversely affect the profits of the Integrated Business.

7        Without any prejudice to the generality of paragraph 6, until the
         expiry of the Adjustment Periods the Purchaser shall procure (so far as
         it is within its power to do so) that none of the following shall occur
         without the prior written consent of the Sellers:

                                       61

         (b)      the formation or acquisition of any subsidiary of the
                  Integrated Business;

         (c)      the disposal of any material part of the assets or undertaking
                  of the Integrated Business otherwise than in the ordinary and
                  proper course of business, and then only at full open-market
                  value on an arm's length basis (and for the purpose of this
                  sub-paragraph any transfer of any part of the assets or
                  undertaking of the Integrated Business to the Purchaser or any
                  member of the Purchaser's Group shall not be considered to be
                  in the ordinary and proper course of business);

         (d)      the entering into of any transaction by the Integrated
                  Business other than on normal arms length commercial terms;

         (e)      any transfer to the Integrated Business of any onerous or
                  unprofitable activity, undertaking or obligation of the
                  Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group, or of any
                  third party in return for which the Purchaser or any member of
                  the Purchaser's Group receives a benefit;

         (f)      any diversion or redirection of the custom of any major
                  customer or client of the Integrated Business away from the
                  Integrated Business;

         (g)      the purchase by the Integrated Business from the Purchaser or
                  any member of the Purchaser's Group of any goods or services
                  at a price higher than a commercial arm's length rate for the
                  goods or services in question;

         (h)      the development of any business by the Purchaser or within the
                  Purchaser's Group that competes with the business of any
                  member of the Integrated Business as carried on at Completion
                  or at any time;

         (i)      payment of any fees or other emoluments (other than
                  reimbursement of properly incurred expenses) to any director
                  or employee save for those who devote their full time to the
                  Integrated Business; and
