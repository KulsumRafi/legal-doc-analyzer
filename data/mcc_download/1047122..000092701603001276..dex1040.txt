                WHEREAS, WGI and certain other WGI Parties commenced cases under

                WHEREAS, Raytheon and certain other Raytheon Parties have
provided surety bonds, letters of credit, guarantees, or similar credit support

1.      RAYTHEON ASSERTED CLAIMS

                Section 1.1 Allowance and Discharge in Full. Under the Plan, the
Raytheon Asserted Claims shall be allowed as filed (without prejudice to Estate
Claims filed by other creditors) and shall be discharged in their entirety. The
Raytheon Parties, however, hereby waive and release to the Estates any
distribution under the Plan on account of the Raytheon Asserted Claims.

                                        2

                Section 1.2 Retention of Rights by Raytheon. Notwithstanding
Section 1.1, the following claims and rights of the Raytheon Parties are
specifically acknowledged, preserved, and not discharged under the Plan or
pursuant to the Confirmation Order:

                (a)     Administrative Claims under section 503 of the
Bankruptcy Code (net of post-petition claims for goods and services provided
pre-Effective Date by the Debtors to the Raytheon Parties) to the extent agreed
upon by the Raytheon Parties, the Debtors and the Committee, or as allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court;

                (b)     Rights of contribution, reimbursement and subrogation
against any of the WGI Parties under outstanding Support Agreements with respect
to assumed projects (and the Hudson-Bergen project) or contracts (collectively,
and including the Hudson-Bergen project, the "Assumed Projects," it being
understood that the Assumed Projects do not include those contracts being
assumed in connection with the Ilijan Project Completion Agreements or being
assumed and assigned in connection with the Ilijan or Red Oak Project Completion
Agreements, or that will be governed by any of such agreements);

                (c)     Rights under the Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement,
which WGI has assumed under the Plan;

                (d)     Rights arising or expressly reserved pursuant to this
Agreement or the specific agreements described in and entered into in connection
with, or contemplated by, this Agreement; and

                (e)     Rights arising under the other agreements listed on
Schedules A1 or A2 to the form of Mutual Release attached to this Agreement as
Exhibit A.

                Section 1.3 Assigned Claims. The Assigned Claims as defined and
described in Appendix I attached to this Agreement are not released, settled or
affected by this Agreement, and Raytheon may receive distributions as the holder
of a Class 7 Claim under the Plan with respect thereto. The Debtors and the
Committee reserve all rights to object to the Assigned Claims.

                Section 1.4 Evidentiary Impact. Nothing with respect to the
allowance or treatment of Raytheon's proofs of claim shall have res judicata or
collateral estoppel effect or be admissible in evidence, in each case with
respect to the rights of any third party, including but not limited to
Mitsubishi (as defined in Section 2.2

                                        3

below), against, by or with respect to, Raytheon or with respect to the rights
of Raytheon against, by or with respect to any third party, including
Mitsubishi.

2.      RAYTHEON SUBROGATION CLAIMS

                Section 2.1 Raytheon Parties' Rights in Respect of Support
Agreements. The Confirmation Order provides, and the WGI Parties and the
Committee agree, that the discharge, release, and injunction provisions
contained in this Agreement do not affect the claims and rights of the Raytheon
Parties against or relating to third parties (but not the Debtors as to
pre-petition matters) as to any suretyship, subrogation, or other rights in
respect of any Support Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Raytheon
Parties shall not receive or retain any distribution under the Plan on account
of subrogation to, or based upon an assignment of, a Class 7 Claim, and the
Raytheon Parties hereby waive and release any distributions under the Plan on
account of the claims and rights of the Raytheon Parties, whether known or
unknown, based upon suretyship, subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or
indemnity, except, in both cases, as provided in Sections 1.3 above or 2.2
below.

                Section 2.2 Rights Under Section 509 of Bankruptcy Code. The
rights, if any, of the Raytheon Parties under section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code
to be subrogated to rights of Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries of America, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., or their
affiliates or subsidiaries (collectively, "Mitsubishi") in respect of payments
made by the Raytheon Parties to Mitsubishi under a Support Agreement are hereby
preserved; provided, however, that (a) the amount of Mitsubishi's Estate Claim
as to which the Raytheon Parties may be subrogated shall not exceed or expand
the amount of $217.5 million (the "Mitsubishi Allowed Claim"), (b) if any
portion of the Mitsubishi Allowed Claim becomes an Assigned Claim, the amount of
such Assigned Claim shall be limited to $100 million, (c) the aggregate amount
of Raytheon's subrogation rights with respect to the Mitsubishi Allowed Claim,
plus other amounts with respect to which distributions under the Plan are made
to Mitsubishi, shall not exceed in the aggregate the Mitsubishi Allowed Claim
(with any allocation to be as may be agreed by Raytheon and Mitsubishi or,
failing such agreement, as the Bankruptcy Court may determine), and (d) the
amount, extent and nature of the Raytheon Parties' rights under section 509 of
the Bankruptcy Code shall be as agreed among Mitsubishi, Raytheon, the Committee
and the Debtors, or failing such agreement, as the Bankruptcy Court may
determine.

3.      FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ASSUMED PROJECTS SUPPORT AGREEMENTS.

                Section 3.1 Rights of Raytheon Parties. The WGI Parties agree to
take, and to cause their subsidiaries and affiliates to take, reasonable and
necessary actions to protect the Raytheon Parties against possible future
exposure under the Support Agreements relating to Assumed Projects (the "Assumed
Projects Support Agreements"). The Raytheon Parties shall have, and are hereby
granted, rights of contribution, reimbursement and subrogation against the WGI
Parties under outstanding Assumed Projects Support Agreements, and all such
rights are hereby expressly acknowledged and recognized and have been so
acknowledged and recognized under the Plan and the Confirmation Order.

                Section 3.2 Joint and Several Obligation: Standby Letter of
Credit. Each of the WGI Parties (excluding WILLC), jointly and severally, hereby
agrees to pay and satisfy their obligations to each of the Raytheon Parties for
any and all obligations, payments or liabilities of such Raytheon Party under
any of the Assumed Projects Support Agreements. Each of the Assumed Projects
Support Agreements, and all obligations arising thereunder shall be, and hereby
are agreed to constitute, the joint and several obligation of each of the
Reorganized Debtors (excluding WILLC) and the obligations thereunder will be
supported by an irrevocable standby letter of credit to be provided by, and for
the account of, the Debtors for the benefit of the Raytheon Parties in the
maximum drawing amount of $10,000,000 (the "Raytheon LOC," the form of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit B). The Raytheon LOC will cover first dollar exposure
for the Assumed Projects Support Agreements, be drawable in accordance with the
terms set forth on Exhibit C hereto and remain in place and available for so
long as, but only to the extent that, any obligation under any Assumed Projects
Support Agreement is in effect.

4.      PENDING LITIGATION

                Section 4.1 Suspension and Dismissal with Prejudice. All pending
litigation pursued by one or more of the Parties against one or more of the
other Parties was suspended on November 8, 2001, and will be dismissed with
prejudice on the Effective Date. Such litigation includes (a) the Raytheon
Actions (including the Idaho Litigation, the purchase price adjustment process
and the American Arbitration Association arbitration matter), and (b) the
Debtors' pending fraudulent transfer adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy
Case.

                Section 4.2 Certain Raytheon Actions. The applicable Raytheon
Parties and WGI Parties agree jointly to withdraw, on or before the Effective
Date, the American Arbitration Association arbitration demand and any related
filings and dismiss those aspects of the Raytheon Actions, without any further
consideration

                                        5

<PAGE>

except for the exchange of mutual releases, and each such Party agrees to bear
its own costs in connection with the foregoing.

                Section 4.3 Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent
Accounting Firm appointed by the court in the Raytheon Actions has been
instructed by WGI and Raytheon to stop work in connection with the purchase
price adjustment, and Raytheon and WGI agree to share equally the costs for the
Independent Accounting Firm through the cessation of work and each such Party to
bear its own costs.

5.      PROJECT SERVICES

                Section 5.1 Assumed Projects. (a) The WGI Parties agree to
provide the Raytheon Parties with (i) on a commercially reasonable efforts
basis, monthly project reports on each Assumed Project to the extent provided to
owners and other clients with respect to such Assumed Project, (ii) copies of
information actually provided to surety companies or WGI Parties' lenders, and
(iii) other mutually-agreed information (except to the extent the provision of
the items set forth in (i), (ii) and (iii) is limited by contract or government
regulation, in which event the WGI Parties and the Raytheon Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to satisfy any such limitation in
order to enable the Raytheon Parties to obtain such information). All
information provided by the WGI Parties under this Section 5.1 shall be subject
to the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 7.4.

                (b)     In the event that any of the WGI Parties or Raytheon
Parties learns of a threatened or pending claim against an Assumed Projects
Support Agreement, WGI shall promptly notify Raytheon (if a WGI Party learns of
it) and Raytheon shall promptly notify WGI (if a Raytheon Party learns of it)
and WGI agrees to provide Raytheon with reasonable access to the WGI Parties'
books, records and personnel on the same basis as provided elsewhere in this
Section 5 and Section 8.13.

                Section 5.2 Projects with Existing Separate Agreements. For the
Sithe Fore River, Sithe Mystic, Red Oak, Puerto Plata, and Ilijan projects
(collectively, the "Separate Projects"), any services to be provided by the WGI
Parties shall be in accordance with the Separate Agreements, which already have
been agreed to.

                Section 5.3 Services Agreement for Certain Projects. The
Saltend, Damhead, Jindal, Posven, Ratchaburi, Tallahassee, Acme, Ezhou, Egypt
Electric, UCH and NACIC projects, together with any and all other projects or
contracts (but

                                        6

<PAGE>

excluding the Separate Projects) rejected by any of the WGI Parties with respect
to which any Raytheon Party has provided a Support Agreement where there may
need to be further physical work or other routine project closeout activities,
and the Clear Alaska project, shall be the subject of the Services Agreement.

                Section 5.4 Third Party Litigation and Claims Support for All
Projects/Contracts with Respect to which Project Claims Against Raytheon Are
Threatened or Asserted.

                (a)     Application. The Services Agreement shall govern the
provision of litigation and claim-related support that falls within the scope of
Completion Services. The Separate Agreements shall govern the provision of
litigation and claim-related support that falls within the scope of services
required to be provided pursuant to the Separate Agreements. Except to the
extent governed by the Services Agreement or Separate Agreements as described
above, this Section 5.4 shall describe, and shall apply to, litigation and
claims (collectively, the "Project Claims") that fall within one or more of the
following categories: (i) litigation or claims that relate to any contract or
project rejected by any of the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Case pursuant to
section 365 or 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Rejected Projects"); (ii)
litigation or claims that relate to projects or contracts neither rejected nor
assumed by any WGI Party in the Bankruptcy Case and where such litigation or
claims are asserted against any Raytheon Party or under or with respect to a
Support Agreement; (iii) litigation or claims that involve an Assumed Project as
to which any WGI Party has breached and failed to cure its payment or
reimbursement obligations relating to the applicable Support Agreement relating
to such Assumed Project as required under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 6.1(b) (a
"Breached Assumed Project"); or (iv) litigation or claims that involve an
Assumed Project as to which a claim is asserted against a Raytheon Party,
whether or not such claim is asserted under or with respect to a Support
Agreement or any of the contracts relating to such Assumed Project assumed by
the WGI Parties.

                (b)     General Assistance. (i) At Raytheon's request, the WGI
Parties shall provide the Raytheon Parties with support in asserting or
defending actual or threatened Project Claims or litigation or proceedings
(including arbitration) in any forum in which any Project Claim is being
asserted, defended, or resolved (collectively, the "Project Claims Litigation")
involving third parties arising (A) under any contract relating to a Rejected
Project, or (B) in respect of (I) Project Claims also asserted or threatened to
be asserted against any of the Raytheon Parties or under or with respect to a
Support Agreement, or (II) in connection with a Breached Assumed Project, claims
asserted or threatened against any of the

                                        7

<PAGE>

Raytheon Parties or under or with respect to a Support Agreement (the matters
described in the foregoing paragraphs (A) and (B) are collectively referred to
as "Project Claim Matters"). The WGI Parties agree that they will diligently and
in good faith provide documentation, information, access, and access to (but not
use of) personnel reasonably requested by the Raytheon Parties in connection
with any Project Claim Matters, which information, documentation and access also
shall be available to the Committee.

                        (ii)  Without in any way limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it shall be deemed reasonable for Raytheon to request to meet with
witnesses who are WGI Party personnel in advance of any testimony they may be
asked or required to give at a deposition or hearing of any sort and to have
them travel to the location of any hearing; provided that WGI Party personnel
shall not be required to provide any in-country support or services in Pakistan
or any other foreign country in connection with any project unless (A) WGI is
reasonably satisfied regarding safety and security in Pakistan or such other
foreign country and (B) in the case of Pakistan only, WGI is satisfied in its
sole and absolute discretion regarding its exposure to legal liability to
judgments or other legal process. In the event that WGI is not reasonably
satisfied regarding safety or security in Pakistan or such other foreign
country, WGI shall notify Raytheon of such concerns and the WGI Parties and the
Raytheon Parties shall meet to discuss such concerns and, acting in good faith,
to enter into alternative arrangements.

                        (iii) Each of the WGI Parties hereby represents and
warrants that, other than in connection with settlements with Raytheon or
Mitsubishi or other settlements presented to and approved by the Bankruptcy
Court (after notice to Raytheon and the Committee), since November 8, 2001 to
the date of this Agreement, the WGI Parties have not compromised or settled any
Estate Claim, Project Claim, or Project Claim Litigation involving a matter
referred to in this Section 5.4 without obtaining, in addition to any other
required consent, the consent of Raytheon and the Committee.

                        (iv)  Except in the case of a Breached Assumed Project,
Raytheon agrees to compensate the WGI Parties for the support provided pursuant
to this paragraph (b) on the same basis of Allowable Costs plus a 7.5% fee, as
provided in the Services Agreement with respect to Completion Services.

                (c)     Notice. If any of the WGI Parties receives any writing
in which a claim is asserted or threatened against any of the WGI Parties either
(i) in connection with any project with respect to which a Support Agreement
exists or (ii)

                                        8

<PAGE>

with respect to which any of the Raytheon Parties is alleged to have, or any WGI
Party has a reasonable basis for knowing such Raytheon Party has, financial
exposure based upon the existence or terms of a Support Agreement or any other
agreement or legal theory ("Possible Project Claim"), the WGI Parties agree to
provide Raytheon with prompt notice of the claim. If a claim is asserted or
threatened against any of the WGI Parties that constitutes or relates to a
Possible Project Claim or an Estate Claim, WGI agrees to provide the Committee
with prompt notice of such claim.

                (d)     Additional Obligations. In addition to the general
assistance obligations under paragraph (b) above and the notice obligations
under paragraph (c) above:

                        (i)   with respect to (A) a Rejected Project Claim, (B)
any Project Claim Matter (other than a Rejected Project Claim) or any Possible
Project Claim or Project Claim Litigation, in each case as to which both WGI
and the Committee indicate that they do not have a material interest, or (C) a
claim arising in connection with a Breached Assumed Project (collectively,
"Raytheon Controllable Claims"), then in each such case, upon Raytheon's written
request, the applicable WGI Parties and the Committee agree to permit Raytheon
or the applicable Raytheon Party to direct the response to the claim and any
related litigation, including without limitation, asserting counterclaims
including those that preserve the WGI Parties' recoupment or set-off rights,
control the process and receive any resulting proceeds (subject to the
provisions of Section 5.5(b) below), provided that, in the case of Raytheon
Controllable Claims of the types described in paragraphs (A) or (B) above,
Raytheon pays all of the defense and other litigation costs in connection
therewith.

                        (ii)  To the extent that Raytheon requests any of the
WGI  Parties or the Committee, as applicable, to pursue any Rejected Project
Claim or any other affirmative claim of a WGI Party relating to a Project Claim
in one or more of the WGI Parties' own name, and the relevant WGI Parties
reasonably determine that the pursuit of such matter in its own name would have
a material adverse impact on an existing or potential customer, supplier,
subcontractor or other material business relationship, then, subject to the
following proviso, the WGI Parties shall not be required to pursue such claim in
their own name, but will assign such claim to Raytheon or RECI or their
designees; provided that (I) such an assignment would be legally effective and
(II) Raytheon determines that the assignment of such claim or the failure of the
WGI Parties to pursue the claim in their own name will not adversely affect the
pursuit of such claim or other matter related in any way to that claim,
including the defense of any claims or counterclaims relating to the same

                                        9

<PAGE>

project or expose any Raytheon Party to liabilities or damages for which it is
not otherwise exposed or liable. In the event of any such assignment, the WGI
Parties will provide documentation, information, access and access to, and use
of, personnel reasonably requested by Raytheon to provide claim analysis and
investigation and other background support, and Raytheon otherwise will have the
claim and litigation support provided under this Agreement. In the event that
any claim is not assigned due to a failure to meet either of the conditions in
the proviso in the second preceding sentence, the relevant WGI Parties will
pursue the applicable matter in their own name, but, in the event that the
condition referred to in subclause II of such proviso is not met, the Raytheon
Parties and WGI Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure
such pursuit in a manner that mitigates to the extent reasonably possible any
material adverse effect on the WGI Parties' business relationships while not
adversely affecting the pursuit or defense of such claim.

                        (iii) For any Project Claim Matters not addressed in
Section 5.4(d)(i) or in the event that Raytheon makes a reasonable determination
that any Raytheon Party is or may be exposed to liability under a Support
Agreement or any other agreement or legal theory related to a Project Claim
Matter that is not a Raytheon Controllable Claim (collectively, "Joint Defense
Claims"), upon Raytheon's reasonable request, the applicable WGI Parties, and,
if the exposure is related to an existing Estate Claim or may give rise to an
Estate Claim, the Committee, and Raytheon shall enter into mutual defense
arrangements, to be agreed upon in good faith. Those arrangements shall be
appropriate under the circumstances of the particular Joint Defense Claim and,
to the extent appropriate, each of the affected Parties will agree to (A)
provide each other with all pleadings and notices in connection with such Joint
Defense Claim, (B) provide each other with access to all relevant or related
records and documents, (C) recognize the joint defense and common interest
privilege between the affected Parties and their affiliates, (D) confer with
each other prior to filing dispositive pleadings, making offers to settle or
other major events, and (E) allow each other privileged access to relevant
defense counsel. The WGI Parties and the Committee also acknowledge the right of
Raytheon or another applicable Raytheon Party to intervene in its own name. In
the event that any such Joint Defense Claim thereafter becomes a Raytheon
Controllable Claim, the provisions of Section 5.4(d)(i) shall apply.

                        (iv)  Upon Raytheon's reasonable request, the WGI
Parties and the Committee agree to cooperate with Raytheon and provide
reasonable cooperation and support to Raytheon in responding to the Project
Claims, Project Claim Litigation, Project Claim Matters, and Possible Project
Claims to assist the Raytheon Parties in mitigating any exposure and risk they
may have; provided,

                                       10

<PAGE>

however, in no event shall any WGI Party or the Committee be required to provide
legal services to Raytheon. Raytheon shall be permitted to use counsel
previously involved in the matter, and all Parties agree to waive any conflict.

                (e)     Costs, Budgeting, Etc. With respect to any provision of
Section 5.4(d) that provides that the WGI Parties will provide services, except
with respect to a Breached Support Agreement, Raytheon will reimburse or
otherwise be responsible for the WGI Parties' costs in providing support
pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) and such costs shall be based on Allowable
Costs, including Allowable Costs of in-house counsel and administrative
personnel, plus a fee of 7.5%. To the extent practicable, prior to the WGI
Parties incurring any costs, Raytheon and WGI will prepare and agree upon a
proposed scope description of the services to be provided and budget and
reconciliation, payment and audit procedures, similar to the procedures
contemplated by Section 2(d) of the Services Agreement.

                (f)     Without in any way limiting the generality or scope of
Section 8.10, nothing in this Section 5.4 is intended to, nor does it, in any
way (i) benefit or create any rights or benefits for any Person that is not a
signatory to this Agreement, or (ii) establish, or constitute an assumption of,
any liabilities, duties, or obligations to, any Person not a signatory to this
Agreement.

                Section 5.5 Raytheon Parties' Rights to Rejected Project Claims,
Etc. (a) The Raytheon Parties shall have the benefit of and be able to pursue or
settle rights and claims of the WGI Parties in connection with Rejected Projects
against customers, project owners, contractors, subcontractors, vendors and
other third parties ("Rejected Project Claims"), subject to such parties' rights
and defenses, if any, to such Rejected Project Claims. In addition, Raytheon or
another applicable Raytheon Party may elect to control the process in the same
manner as provided in Section 5.4 with respect to Raytheon Controllable Claims
or may elect to control the process in the same manner as provided in Section
5.6 with respect to Estate Claims, as applicable, and receive any resulting
proceeds, in each case with respect to Rejected Projects, subject to the
provisions of paragraph (b) below. The WGI Parties and Raytheon agree that as
part of the defense of any related Raytheon Controllable Claims and pursuit of
Rejected Project Claims, any contract balances and affirmative claims of the WGI
Parties, including without limitation the rights in the equity of Posven C.A.
(and the WGI Parties agree within fifteen (15) days of a written request
therefore, to provide Raytheon or its designee with the stock certificate(s) or
other evidence of such equity), against project owners, customers, or others
will be used first in respect of each such defense or pursuit to compromise,
reduce or eliminate such Estate Claim or claim of a specific owner or any other
specific third party in

                                       11

<PAGE>

connection with that specific Estate Claim or claim asserted, respectively,
against the WGI Parties or against the Raytheon Parties. As part of the Rejected
Project Claims, assets or proceeds from whatever source claimed from third
parties related to the Rejected Projects shall belong and be paid over directly
to Raytheon or another applicable Raytheon Party, subject to the provisions of
paragraph (b) below. Raytheon shall endeavor in good faith to avoid prejudice to
existing rights and claims, if any, of the Reorganized Debtors with respect to
such projects and upon request shall give reasonable notice to WGI and the
Committee of the status and results of such legal action. With respect to any
Rejected Project Claims being pursued by Raytheon directly in the name of the
WGI Parties, Raytheon shall provide periodic updates to WGI and the Committee
and, if WGI provides notice to Raytheon and the Committee that WGI or the
Committee has a concern about specified Rejected Project Claims, (i) Raytheon
shall provide to WGI and the Committee reasonable periodic information regarding
the case, (ii) before deciding to abandon the pursuit of the particular Rejected
Project Claim, so advise WGI and the Committee and permit WGI or the Committee,
as appropriate, to take over the Rejected Project Claim for its own account and
(iii) Raytheon will not obtain (or retain) an affirmative recovery for its own
account (by settlement or otherwise) if the opposing party in the case retains
an Estate Claim or an affirmative claim against the Reorganized Debtors.

                (b)     In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph
(a), with respect to each of the Rejected Projects, other than the Designated
Projects and except as otherwise provided in the Ilijan Project Completion
Agreements and the Red Oak Project Completion Agreement, to the extent that
after first paying or discharging obligations due to and related costs incurred
by the Raytheon Parties under the related Support Agreement or the Services
Agreement and in pursuing Rejected Project Claims relating to that Rejected
Project, there remain Net Proceeds from Rejected Project Claims in connection
with that Rejected Project, Raytheon shall provide written notice thereof to WGI
and the Committee and shall pay over the amount of such excess to WGI, which is
entitled to such excess. With respect to the Designated Projects, however,
Raytheon or another applicable Raytheon Party shall be entitled to all assets,
claims and recoveries, if any.

                (c)     Without in any way limiting the generality or scope of
Section 8.10, nothing in this Section 5.5 is intended to, nor does it in any way
(i) benefit or create any rights or benefits for any Person that is not a
signatory to this Agreement, or (ii) establish, or constitute an assumption of,
any liabilities, duties, or obligations to, any Person not a signatory to this
Agreement.

                Section 5.6 Claims Allowance Process. This Section 5.6 shall
apply to all Estate Claims being allowed, disputed, or resolved in whole or in
part in the Bankruptcy Court or in an alternative forum to which the Bankruptcy
Court has ceded jurisdiction by an order entered in the Bankruptcy Case that was
not sought by the Committee ("Alternative Forum") with respect to matters
involving or otherwise related to any Raytheon Party or any Project Claim with
respect to which any Raytheon Party (a) has any actual or potential liability,
(b) is entitled to pursue a recovery in respect of such Project Claim in
accordance with this Agreement or (c) otherwise has any pecuniary interest in or
with respect to such Estate Claim (a "Raytheon Related Estate Claim").

                (a)     The Raytheon Parties, the WGI Parties and the Committee
agree to cooperate in the development and implementation of a process for the
resolution of Estate Claims generally and Raytheon Related Estate Claims in
particular in the Bankruptcy Case (the "Claims Allowance Process").

                (b)     The Raytheon Parties may initiate or seek to intervene
or otherwise participate as parties in a Claims Allowance Process matter with
respect to particular Raytheon Related Estate Claims. The WGI Parties and the
Committee agree to support that participation, in a manner consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, so long as such intervention or
participation would not unduly delay the adjudication of the rights of the
original parties, and further agree to permit Raytheon to control the
litigation, arbitration or other determination of the Raytheon Related Estate
Claims, including, without limitation, the assertion of counterclaims or the
right of setoff or recoupment, as appropriate; provided however that the
Committee, as provided in the Plan, may settle or compromise a Raytheon Related
Estate Claim as long as such settlement or compromise does not determine or
adversely affect the liability, if any, of the Raytheon Parties with respect to
such Raytheon Related Estate Claim and as long as such settlement or compromise
does not require any payment by a Raytheon Party. If the Bankruptcy Court or the
court or panel in such Alternative Forum permits the Raytheon Parties to so
intervene or otherwise participate as a party with respect to a particular
Raytheon Related Estate Claim, the Committee or Raytheon may seek a
determination from the Bankruptcy Court of the obligations, if any, of the
Raytheon Parties to a Person with respect to such Raytheon Related Estate Claim
that is based upon such party's rights under a Support Agreement and the
Raytheon Parties (i) may seek a ruling that their obligations, if any, should
not be so determined on any ground other than lack of personal jurisdiction over
the Raytheon Parties or improper venue, and/or (ii) may oppose the relief sought
on the merits.

                                       13

<PAGE>

                (c)     The Raytheon Parties, rather than seeking to intervene
or otherwise participate as a party, may request in a writing that refers to
this Section 5.6 that the WGI Parties and/or the Committee permit the Raytheon
Parties to direct their actions as to a particular Raytheon Related Estate Claim
(including with respect to settlement and allowance of the Raytheon Related
Estate Claim), including, without limitation, the assertion of counterclaims or
the right of setoff or recoupment, as appropriate, provided that the Raytheon
Parties agree to reimburse all reasonable fees, costs, and expenses associated
with their doing so. The WGI Parties and the Committee agree to comply with such
request and to follow such direction from the Raytheon Parties; provided,
however, that the Committee, as provided in the Plan, may settle or compromise a
Raytheon Related Estate Claim as long as such settlement or compromise does not
determine or adversely affect the liability, if any, of the Raytheon Parties
with respect to such Raytheon Related Estate Claim and as long as such
settlement or compromise does not require any payment by a Raytheon Party.

                (d)     Except as, but only to the extent, expressly provided
herein, the Estates and the Committee acting on behalf of the Estates reserve
their rights, if any, under applicable law or procedural rules to seek an order
joining one or more Raytheon Parties in any matter, proceeding or other civil
action (including arbitration) in the Claims Allowance Process with respect to a
particular Raytheon Related Estate Claim and to request a determination by the
Bankruptcy Court of the obligations, if any, of the Raytheon Parties to the
Person or Persons asserting such Raytheon Related Estate Claim under a Support
Agreement or other agreement or legal theory. Except as, but only to the extent,
expressly provided herein, the Raytheon Parties reserve their rights, if any, to
oppose any such motion, request or action on any grounds under applicable law or
procedural rules. The Parties intend and agree that nothing in this Agreement,
including, without limitation, this Section 5.6, is intended to, or does,
suggest the existence or validity of any rights or expand, restrict, or in any
way affect or influence the nature, existence, or validity of any of the rights,
if any, reserved under this Section 5.6(d).

                (e)     In the event that in the Claims Allowance Process in the
Bankruptcy Court or an Alternative Forum, the Raytheon Parties (i) initiate,
intervene or participate as a party in the determination of a Raytheon Related
Estate Claim as provided in paragraph (b) above, or (ii) elect to direct the
litigation, arbitration or other determination of a Raytheon Related Estate
Claim as provided in paragraph (c) above, and (x) in each case, the WGI Parties
and the Committee have permitted the Raytheon Parties to control the defense of
the Raytheon Related Estate Claim, and (y) if, but only if, the Bankruptcy Court
or the Court or panel in that

                                       14

<PAGE>

Alternative Forum, after having afforded the Raytheon Parties a full and fair
opportunity to be heard, should determine in a Final Order that one or more
Raytheon Parties are liable under a Support Agreement to the Person asserting
the Raytheon Related Estate Claim, then the Raytheon Parties will pay or
otherwise resolve their liability to such Person, which payment shall extinguish
the liability of both the Estate for such Raytheon Related Estate Claim and the
Raytheon Parties for such Raytheon Related Estate Claim. Subject to the provisos
contained in paragraphs (b) and (c), no settlement of any Raytheon Related
Estate Claim that is referred to in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above shall be agreed
to or supported by the WGI Parties or the Committee without the consent of
Raytheon, if the settlement contemplates any payment by, or could have an
adverse economic consequence for, any Raytheon Party.

                (f)     The WGI Parties agree that they will provide assistance
in the Claims Allowance Process to Raytheon if Raytheon initiates, intervenes or
otherwise participates as a party in a Claims Allowance Process matter,
including the furnishing of documentation, information, financial data,
reasonable access to personnel, and reasonable access to WGI's counsel and other
professionals, and, upon the request of the Committee, with Raytheon's consent,
the WGI Parties will provide all such assistance to the Committee as well. The
WGI Parties shall also provide to the Committee, at the Committee's request with
prior notice to Raytheon, assistance, documentation, information, financial
data, reasonable access to personnel, and reasonable access to WGI counsel and
other professionals, but, without Raytheon's consent, shall not provide the
Committee with any such information, financial data, access to personnel, WGI
counsel and other professionals that the WGI Parties would not be obligated to
provide to a third party pursuant to discovery under the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure. The Committee shall not voluntarily provide any non-public
information received pursuant to this Agreement to any third party unless
consented to by Raytheon and shall not use any assistance or information
provided to it by WGI in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement. Raytheon consents to the WGI Parties providing such information to
the Committee and agrees that doing so will not constitute a breach of the
confidentiality provisions or other information request provisions of this
Agreement (subject to any applicable protective order) and the Committee agrees
to observe the confidentiality obligations as though it were a WGI Party. Such
assistance will be furnished to the Committee by Reorganized WGI without charge.
The reimbursement of expenses, fees, and costs of the Committee are to be borne
by Reorganized WGI pursuant to the Plan. The Raytheon Parties will reimburse all
accrued but unpaid reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the WGI
Parties in providing the Raytheon Parties with the assistance, but only to the
extent such fees, costs and

                                       15

<PAGE>

expenses exceed the amounts required to provide assistance to the Committee.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect or limit, or be deemed to be a
waiver of, the right, if any, of any Party to seek discovery, including
testimony and the production of documents in any matter, proceeding or other
civil action (including arbitration).

                (g)     The Parties agree that, without formally participating
in the resolution of a Raytheon Related Estate Claim as contemplated by
paragraph (b) or (c) above, and thereby making applicable the provisions of
paragraph (e) above, that (i) the Parties may consult with respect to any
Raytheon Related Estate Claim, Raytheon may be consulted respecting its views
and preferences and Raytheon may provide comments and suggestions with respect
to the resolution of any Raytheon Related Estate Claim, and (ii) the WGI Parties
and the Committee shall consult and confer with Raytheon with respect to any
Raytheon Related Estate Claim related in any way to a Project Claim.

                (h)     The determination of the amount of an Allowed Claim in
the Claims Allowance Process shall not expand, limit or alter the obligation of
the Raytheon Parties, if any, to make payments under a Support Agreement with
respect to such Raytheon Related Estate Claim. In no event, will the WGI Parties
or the Committee consent to the entry of an order fixing the amount of an
Allowed Class 7 Claim in an amount different from that with respect to which
distributions under the Plan are to be made to the holder of such Allowed Class
7 Claim.

                (i)     Except as, but only to the extent, expressly provided
herein the Raytheon Parties, the WGI Parties and the Committee agree that each
Party reserves its rights under applicable law and procedural rules in
connection with any specific matter, proceeding, or civil action (including
arbitration) and that no Party has agreed to create or waive rights in respect
of such law or rules or in favor of third parties under this Section 5.6.

                (j)     Without in any way limiting the generality or scope of
Section 8.10, nothing in this Section 5.6 is intended to, nor does it in any way
(i) benefit or create any rights or benefits for any Person that is not a
signatory to this Agreement, or (ii) establish, or constitute an assumption of,
any liabilities, duties, or obligations to, any Person not a signatory to this
Agreement.

                Section 5.7 PP9 Project. Raytheon and WGI acknowledge that both
the "Consortium Agreement" and the project agreements for the so-called "PP9
Project" are between certain WGI Parties and General Electric Company and its

                                       16

<PAGE>

affiliates and are being assumed by the WGI Parties as part of the Bankruptcy
Case, while the project agreements for the Ratchaburi project were also between
certain WGI Parties and General Electric Company and its affiliates but were
rejected by the WGI Parties as part of the Bankruptcy Case, and agree that their
respective interests in the Ratchaburi project and the PP9 Project will be
independent from each other, with rights and obligations remaining separate
between the two projects, and benefits and burdens for each project will remain
with that project and the parties involved. Accordingly, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Raytheon to settle or compromise any
claim relating to the PP9 Project or to receive or retain any amounts payable by
any third party with respect to such project, and nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to authorize any WGI Party to settle or compromise any claim
relating to the Ratchaburi project or to receive or retain any amounts payable
by any third party with respect to the Ratchaburi project.

6.      ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                Section 6.1 Agreements Involving Assumed Projects Support
Agreements.

                (a)     Certain Support Agreements. The WGI Parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with their capabilities and
circumstances) to identify and replace Assumed Projects Support Agreements of
relatively long duration and/or that involve relatively little risk. WGI shall
endeavor in good faith to terminate the Support Agreements in connection with
Pine Bluff. WGI may consult with Raytheon from time to time concerning the
progress made with respect to any such releases, and Raytheon agrees to provide
reasonable assistance in such process. For purposes of this Section 6.1 only,
Gulf Chemical shall be an "Assumed Project."

                (b)     Reimbursement and Repayment. (i) With respect to Assumed
Projects Support Agreements, the WGI Parties agree to reimburse the applicable
Raytheon Party for all third-party premiums, payments and other carrying costs
of those Support Agreements, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of invoices
for these amounts. If a Raytheon Party is required to reimburse a letter of
credit issuer for any drawing under an Assumed Projects Support Agreement, or is
required to make any payment under an Assumed Projects Support Agreement that is
a guaranty or surety bond (other than carrying costs as provided above or to
reimburse the issuer of a surety bond under an indemnity agreement or
otherwise), then the WGI Parties agree to reimburse such Raytheon Party within
three (3) business days after receipt of Raytheon's demand for payment.

                                       17

<PAGE>

                        (ii) The WGI Parties' payment and reimbursement
obligations under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and this Section 6, as among each of the
WGI Parties (but excluding WILLC), is a joint and several obligation and shall
not be subject to any right of set-off or defense to payment that otherwise
might be available. Each of the WGI Parties (but excluding WILLC), jointly and
severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a
surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with all other WGI
Parties, with respect to the payment and reimbursement obligations under
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and this Section 6, it being the intention of the Parties
that all the obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of
the WGI Parties (but excluding WILLC) without preferences or distinction among
them. The first dollar exposure for any such amounts shall be drawable by
Raytheon under the Raytheon LOC, in accordance with the terms set forth on
Exhibit C hereto.

                (c)     Reporting. Until a particular Assumed Projects Support
Agreement is completely released, the WGI Parties agree to provide Raytheon with
(i) on a commercially reasonable efforts basis, monthly project reports on each
Assumed Project to the extent provided to owners and other clients with respect
to such Assumed Project, (ii) copies of information actually provided to surety
companies or the WGI Parties' lenders, and (iii) other mutually-agreed
information (except to the extent the provision of the items set forth in (i),
(ii) or (iii) is limited by contract or government regulation, in which event
the WGI Parties and the Raytheon Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy any such limitation in order to enable the Raytheon Parties
to obtain such information). All information provided by the WGI Parties under
this Section 6.1 shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in
Section 7.4. In connection with Assumed Projects, Raytheon shall not have access
to the WGI Parties' books, records or personnel until any of the Raytheon
Parties has reason to believe or any of the WGI Parties has knowledge that third
parties may have rights to or have, or have threatened to assert, claims with
respect to any Assumed Projects Support Agreements. In that event, the WGI
Parties agree to provide diligently and in good faith all documentation,
information, access, and access to personnel requested by Raytheon, as though
subject to the Services Agreement and as provided in Section 8.13.

7.      LITIGATION RELEASES AND THIRD PARTY ISSUES

                Section 7.1 Mutual Releases; Resolution of Certain Claims. (a)
(i) Raytheon and WGI agree to execute and deliver, and to cause the appropriate

                                       18

<PAGE>

Raytheon Parties and WGI Parties, respectively, and the Persons related thereto,
to execute and deliver, duly authorized releases in the form set forth in
Exhibit A.

                        (ii)  Raytheon and WGI shall not be obligated to obtain
releases from subsidiaries or other affiliates that are not wholly-owned
(referred to as a "Non-Releasing Entity"), but Raytheon and WGI each agree to
indemnify the other party and all related parties that are the subject of the
releases against all claims and causes of action ever asserted now or in the
future by such Non-Releasing Entity that would have been covered had the
Non-Releasing Entity delivered a release as described above; provided, however,
that such indemnity shall not extend to contracts between any Raytheon Parties
and any WGI Parties entered into in the ordinary course.

                (b)     At Raytheon's request and expense, the WGI Parties, to
the extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Court, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to use the post-confirmation jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court to
resolve disputed, contingent, or unliquidated claims being asserted by third
parties that Raytheon reasonably believes relate to property of the Estate and
will use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperating in other jurisdictions
to resolve disputed, contingent, or unliquidated claims and claims based in any
way on the Stock Purchase Agreement and the various agreements executed and
delivered pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the
claim involved is an Estate Claim, the Estate Claim shall be the subject of the
Claims Allowance Process and shall be governed by Section 5.6, and the
resolution of any such Estate Claim shall be through the Claims Allowance
Process. When such claims involve Rejected Projects involving outstanding
Support Agreements that may be subject to such claims, the use of the
post-confirmation jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court as described herein shall
be subject to Raytheon's consent and right to direct the response to the claim
and any related litigation, to control the process and to receive any resulting
proceeds, in a manner consistent with Sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6.

                Section 7.2 SPA Information. (a) The Parties agree to keep
confidential (and to use their best efforts to cause their respective agents and
representatives to keep confidential) any "SPA Information"; provided however
that the parties may utilize SPA Information on a non-confidential basis as
reasonably required in connection with conduct of their business or otherwise in
furtherance of WGI's business interests (including, without limitation, existing
or potential business arrangements, but excluding any business interests or
arrangements involving the pursuit of claims against the Raytheon Parties). SPA
Information, for purposes of this Section 7.2 and Section 7.5 below means,
collectively, (a) any information or

                                       19

<PAGE>

documents provided to Morrison Knudsen or the WGI Parties or their agents by the
Raytheon Parties or (b) any information or documents provided to the Raytheon
Parties or their agents by Morrison Knudsen or the WGI Parties, in each case in
connection with the negotiation or implementation of the Stock Purchase
Agreement or pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of August 4,
1999 between Raytheon Company and Morrison Knudsen Corporation. This obligation
shall not apply with respect to any information that: (x) was known by the WGI
Parties or the Raytheon Parties prior to receipt from the other party; (xi) was
developed independently by the WGI Parties without the use of SPA Information;
(xii) is in the public domain or otherwise generally available to the public; or
(xiii) was received by the WGI Parties from third parties under no known
confidentiality obligation to the Raytheon Parties, including those under this
Agreement.

                (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the WGI Parties and the
Raytheon Parties, respectively, may disclose SPA Information (i) to the extent
requested or required by any regulatory authority, government authority, or
examining authority or provided to such authority to the extent such Party, in
its discretion, has determined that it should do so to protect or preserve its
own legal, regulatory, or commercial interests, or (ii) to the extent necessary
for any Party to defend against a suit, action or proceeding to which it or any
of its officers or directors is a party.

                (c)     The Raytheon Parties and WGI Parties agree not to waive
intentionally or release any known privileges or protections with respect to
non-public SPA Information and the businesses sold pursuant thereto as it
relates to any third party litigation that may involve a Raytheon Party or WGI
Party without first giving reasonable notice to the other Party.

                Section 7.3 Discovery Materials. (a) All documents,
interrogatory answers, deposition testimony, and deposition exhibits produced or
obtained in the Bankruptcy Cases and the Idaho Litigation, all submissions made
by Raytheon and WGI in connection with the purchase price adjustment
proceedings, and all transcripts of proceedings before the Independent
Accounting Firm (collectively, "Discovery Materials") shall be governed by this
Section 7.3 and Section 7.5 below. A Party's own documents in the hands of such
Party including, without limitation, documents it produced in connection with
such cases, shall not constitute Discovery Materials.

                (b)     The parties may retain Discovery Materials, except for
the 116 documents believed by WGI to be privileged and previously identified to
Raytheon, which, to the extent held by Raytheon, shall be returned to, and
retained (i.e., not

                                       20

<PAGE>

destroyed) by WGI. The Parties shall not disclose Discovery Materials to any
Person unless such Person has acknowledged in writing that s/he has read the
terms of this Section 7.3 and is personally bound by it, and such Person is (i)
a client representative of the Party retaining possession of such Discovery
Materials, (ii) an attorney, accountant, financial advisor, expert, or other
professional retained by such client, or (iii) a Person to whom disclosure of
the Discovery Materials has been consented to by the Party who first provided
the Discovery Materials.

                (c)     Notwithstanding and without limitation of the foregoing
and subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, a Party may disclose Discovery
Materials that have entered the public domain other than through an improper
disclosure by such Party.

                Section 7.4 Other Confidential Information. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.5 below, the Parties agree to keep confidential (and to
use their best efforts to cause their respective agents and representatives to
keep confidential) the Confidential Information and all copies thereof, extracts
therefrom and analyses or other materials based thereon. For the purposes of
this Section 7.4 and Section 7.5 below, "Confidential Information" shall mean
any confidential information that concerns the business and operations of any
Party and that has been acquired by any other Party pursuant to this Agreement.
This obligation shall not apply with respect to any information that: (i) was
known by the WGI Parties or the Raytheon Parties prior to receipt from the other
party; or (ii) is in the public domain.

                (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section
7.5 below, the WGI Parties and the Raytheon Parties, respectively, may disclose
Confidential Information (i) to such of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, consultants, advisors, affiliates and representatives as need
to know such Confidential Information in order to carry out their normal
business responsibilities, (ii) to the extent requested or required by any
regulatory authority or examining authority, or (iii) in connection with any
suit, action or proceeding relating to the enforcement of its rights hereunder
or under the Services Agreement.

                Section 7.5 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that the WGI
Parties, on the one hand, or the Raytheon Parties, on the other hand, are
required (including but not limited to, by questions under oath,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings,
governmental regulatory or self-regulatory organization requests for
information; or subpoena, civil demand, or other process) (collectively, a
"Document Request") requesting the production of Discovery Materials or
Confidential Information received from the other Party, the

                                       21

<PAGE>

Party so served will provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any
such request or requirement so that the other Party may seek a protective order
or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall require a Party served with a Document Request to violate its legal
obligations thereunder or (but, subject to the foregoing notice requirements as
related to Discovery Materials or Confidential Information) to withhold
information from any regulatory or governmental agency if the Party reasonably
determines that it is in its best interest to provide requested information to
such regulatory or governmental agency. No Party shall be required to give the
notice provided hereby if a regulatory or governmental agency, on its own
initiative, requests that it not provide such notice to any Party. In addition,
this Section 7.5 shall apply to SPA Information requested or required in
connection with any third-party non-government or regulatory Document Request.

                Section 7.6 Avoidance of Further Litigation Activity. The
Raytheon Parties and the WGI Parties agree that they will not affirmatively
assist third parties in pursuing claims against the other Party arising out of
matters resolved under this Agreement.

8.      OTHER MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

                Section 8.1 Use of Name. (a) Raytheon hereby terminates any
license, whether express or implied, the WGI Parties may have been granted, or
may otherwise have been assumed to exist, with respect to use of the "Raytheon"
name, whether alone or in combination with other words or designs. The WGI
Parties hereby acknowledge, agree and consent to the foregoing and agree
immediately to commence actions to terminate use of the Raytheon name. In any
and all events, the WGI Parties agree to cease use of all Raytheon names on or
before March 31, 2002.

                (b)     The WGI Parties hereby acknowledge that Raytheon is the
owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Raytheon Mark, whether
alone or in combination with other words or designs and that the WGI Parties
shall not have any right to use the Raytheon Mark except as expressly authorized
by this Agreement in paragraph (c) below. At the request of Raytheon, WGI will
cause all of the WGI Parties to enter into a separate agreement with Raytheon
covering the same matters set forth in paragraph (a) and this paragraph (b).

                (c)     Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, Raytheon agrees to
grant WGI and REOL as defined herein a limited license to use the name
"Raytheon-Ebasco Overseas Ltd." ("REOL") on projects that are under contract on

                                       22

the date hereof only. Unless Raytheon agrees otherwise in a writing that
specifically refers to this Section 8.1(c), the WG1 Parties agree to make clear
that REOL is no longer affiliated with Raytheon by legends to that effect on
signage, stationery, directories and the like.

                Section 8.2 Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement. The
Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement shall be assumed by WGI and remain the
valid obligation of WGI, Raytheon and RECI. As contemplated by Article 3 of the
Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement, (a) Raytheon and WGI will designate
appropriate representatives to meet and confer by not later than March 15, 2002,
with respect to outstanding claims for Taxes (as defined in the Disaffiliation
Tax Sharing Agreement) and other items provided for under that Agreement for
which either Raytheon or WGI is or may be responsible under the Disaffiliation
Tax Sharing Agreement and refunds for Taxes that either of them is entitled to
under that Agreement, and amounts due shall be agreed upon and paid by not later
than May 31, 2002, and, if no agreement on amounts can be reached, such amounts
shall be determined and paid as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
with all costs to be borne by the non-prevailing party as determined by that
court, (b) WGI will, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the
Confirmation Order, notify Raytheon, in the manner provided in the
Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement, of all proofs of claim relating to Taxes
and all Taxes listed in the schedules to the Plan or filed in the Bankruptcy
Case or for which WGI intends to assert its indemnification rights under the
Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement, (c) Raytheon will have the right to object
to any or all of such claims in the Bankruptcy Case or to direct WGI to make
such objection, (d) Raytheon will have the right to negotiate, compromise and
settle any or all of such claims (or to direct WGI to control the proceedings
with respect to such claims) as and to the extent provided in Article 3 of the
Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement and (e) WGI's failure to perform its
obligation under subsection (b) of this Section 8.2, shall excuse Raytheon from
its indemnification obligations under the Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement
with respect to the affected Taxes to the extent that such failure affects the
rights of Raytheon with respect to such Taxes. Except as specifically modified
or supplemented by this Section 8.2, the Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall exclusively govern all matters
that are the subject thereof.

                Section 8.3 Insurance Claims. The WGI Parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to use rights available under the Bankruptcy
Code to reduce the exposure of each or either of the WGI Parties or the Raytheon
Parties under various insurance arrangements. The WGI Parties and the Raytheon
Parties agree to work in good faith to resolve their respective rights and
obligations under

                                       23

<PAGE>

various insurance policies. The Plan shall not create rights in or to insurance
coverage. Raytheon shall have all rights in and to insurance proceeds and
insurance generally, except that with respect to CGL and professional liability
policies procured by WGI under its corporate program, Raytheon shall have only
such rights with respect to insurance as the Parties may mutually agree for
projects and contracts that involve Rejected Projects, subject to the first
sentence of Section 5.5(b).

                Section 8.4 Warrior Run. With regard to the Warrior Run
Receivable, the WGI Parties agree to remit to Raytheon, from and upon the
release of the proceeds by the owner of the Warrior Run project to WGI, net of
actual out-of-pocket costs of collection from the date hereof, an amount equal
to 32% of the aggregate of the net amount released to WGI from its share and any
other recoveries obtained by WGI from CE/Alstom relating to the Warrior Run
project, provided that Raytheon's net share shall not exceed $4,160,000 (i.e.
capped at 32% of $13 million) of such recoveries. WGI will keep Raytheon
reasonably informed of the status of its litigation with CE/Alstom and will
permit Raytheon to monitor such litigation at its own expense.

                Section 8.5 Nondisparagement. Press releases respecting the
resolution of their disputes and with respect to the settlement embodied in this
Agreement will be mutually agreed upon. The Raytheon Parties and the WGI Parties
agree not to (and agree to cause their respective senior officers, directors and
advisors not to) disparage the other party or its senior officers, directors or
advisors with or to the media.

                Section 8.6 Scope of Agreement. Except with respect to Rejected
Projects, this Agreement does not extend to (a) matters in the insolvency
proceeding of Washington International B.V. that is now pending in The Hague,
Netherlands, except with respect to documents, insurance claim information and
other information, if any, under the care, custody, or control of the WGI
Parties, which shall be treated as if the projects involved were Rejected
Projects, or (b) WGI Parties that are not Debtors but that have obligations
supported by Support Agreements. The Parties acknowledge that WILLC is subject
to a winding up petition filed in the United Kingdom and is deemed to be
insolvent under English law, accordingly, WGI will not be able to require it to
provide support on its projects and WGI agrees to provide support on Saltend and
Damhead pursuant to the Services Agreement through another entity.

                Section 8.7 Status and Effect of Stock Purchase Agreement, Etc.
Upon the Effective Date of the Plan, the rejected Stock Purchase Agreement, the

                                       24

<PAGE>

rejected Receivables Termination Agreement and the rejected Project Completion
Agreements entered into pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, shall
thereupon be terminated and have no further force or effect, right or
obligation, among the parties thereto or otherwise. All matters arising
therefrom as among the parties thereto, including but not limited to, the
Raytheon Claims, the Raytheon Asserted Claims, and the Debtors' fraudulent
transfer adversary action referred to herein, and any obligations, entitlements,
benefits or burdens thereunder, shall be governed, superseded, or replaced, as
the case may be, by this Agreement, the Plan, and the Raytheon Settlement
Provisions and Documents.

                Section 8.8 Order Regarding Stipulated Raytheon Issues and
Stipulation and Order Regarding Confidentiality. Upon the Effective Date, the
Order Regarding Stipulated Raytheon Issues and the Stipulation and Order
Regarding Confidentiality entered in the Bankruptcy Case shall be vacated.

                Section 8.9 Certain Contract Changes. Unless consented to in
writing by Raytheon, the Debtors may not at any time after November 20, 2001,
assume and assign, reject, amend or modify any executory contract or unexpired
lease to which Raytheon is a party or with respect to which there is a related
Support Agreement, other than with respect to ordinary course change orders or
as set forth in the Plan or any Motion filed with the Bankruptcy Court on or
prior to November 20, 2001.

                Section 8.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer, nor does it confer, upon
any third party any rights, remedies, benefits, obligations, or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Raytheon Party by virtue of this Agreement is
assuming or creating any obligations or duties to parties not signatory hereto.

                Section 8.11 Roche Carolina. With regard to the Roche Carolina
litigation, Raytheon and WGI agree that such litigation and all related claims
constitute both a Raytheon Controllable Claim and a Rejected Project Claim and,
accordingly, Raytheon has the right to settle the case or pursue the current
appeal, in each case at Raytheon's cost, and Raytheon has the right to retain
any and all proceeds should the appeal be successful. In addition, Raytheon
agrees that it will pay on behalf of WGI any settlement or non-appealable final
judgment.

                Section 8.12 No Admission of Liability. Each of the Parties
understands and agrees that this Agreement constitutes a compromise and
settlement of

                                       25

<PAGE>

claims that at all times have been disputed and denied. Nothing contained
herein, or otherwise related to this compromise and settlement of these disputed
claims, shall ever constitute or be construed to be an admission of liability or
damages on the part of any Person or Persons released hereunder. This settlement
represents a compromise among the Parties reflecting their mutual desire to
terminate all disputes among them and to avoid the substantial burden of
continued litigation.

                Section 8.13 Access; Records, Etc.. (a) Raytheon Access. During
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, the WGI Parties will permit
Raytheon to have reasonable access to and examine and make copies of all
records, contracts, subcontractor and vendor-related documentation, claims
evaluations, lists, payment records, project correspondence, bids and documents
relating to the Rejected Projects, receivables being collected by Raytheon or
litigation involving Support Agreements or other alleged liability against the
Raytheon Parties. Photocopying will, at Raytheon's option, but after
consultation with WGI and giving consideration to any undue disruption to WGI's
business, be conducted on-site at WGI's offices or offsite using a third party
vendor, in accordance with procedures reasonably satisfactory to WGI. With
regard to access to WGI's Princeton, New Jersey offices, (i) access shall be
given during normal business hours, and (ii) Raytheon's personnel shall be
subject to WGI's prior approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. In addition to those personnel subject to the foregoing approval
process, WGI expressly will pre-approve and permit the persons listed on
Schedule 1 hereto to have access to the Princeton facilities. All requests for
books, access, personnel or otherwise will be made of the Person designated by
WGI to receive such requests, who shall be accessible and available.

                (b)     Turnover of Records. The WGI Parties will not destroy
any files or records related to matters of concern to Raytheon, and identified
to WGI within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement, without giving
at least thirty (30) days' prior notice to Raytheon. Upon receipt of notice,
Raytheon may require that the records involved be delivered to it (subject to
attorney client privileges or work product doctrines, which materials shall be
retained and not destroyed by the WGI Parties and otherwise shall be treated as
provided in Section 7.3), at its expense, or notify WGI that it will pay the
cost of storing and maintaining those books and records (including costs of
moving the books and records to a location under Raytheon's control), but
Raytheon will be required to pay such costs only to the extent that WGI is not
required by applicable law or its own internal policies or practices to retain
such files or records.

                                       26

<PAGE>

                (c)     Personnel. Each of the WGI Parties will provide the
Raytheon Parties with reasonable access to their personnel, to the extent it
still employs them, necessary or helpful for matters with respect to which WGI
is obligated to assist Raytheon. Each of the WGI Parties also will cooperate
with Raytheon in locating personnel who are no longer employed by it.

                (d)     Reimbursement of Costs. Raytheon will reimburse WGI for
its Allowable Costs incurred and for the actual time spent by WGI's employees,
for the matters referred to in (a)-(c) above, including without limitation, the
reasonable Allowable Costs of inside counsel and administrative personnel, plus
a fee of 7.5% of such Allowable Costs (but without duplication of other
payments); provided, however, in no event will WGI be required to provide legal
services to Raytheon. To the extent practicable this support will be funded in
advance against a budget pursuant to procedures similar to those described in
Section 5.4(e). To the extent advance funding is not practicable, amounts shall
be paid within thirty days after submissions of monthly invoices in reasonable
detail. To the extent possible, the payment by Raytheon of any amounts shall not
prejudice its rights to contest the invoice amount against the ultimate third
party payee.

                Section 8.14 Legal Advice. Each of the Parties has received
independent legal advice from its attorneys with respect to this Agreement. Each
of the Parties agrees that it will never deny the validity of this Agreement on
the ground that it did not have the advice of counsel generally or advice of
counsel in the aforementioned litigation.

                Section 8.15 Agreement Binding. (a) Signatories. Each of
Raytheon and RECI represents and warrants to the WGI Parties and each of WGI,
WGI Ohio and the other WGI Parties that are signatories hereto represents and
warrants to the Raytheon Parties as follows: the execution and delivery of this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate,
partnership or similar action on behalf of such Party, and this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable
against such Party in accordance with their terms, subject as to enforcement to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally or
by equitable principles relating to the availability of remedies.

                (b)     Raytheon Parties. Raytheon represents and warrants that
it is duly authorized and empowered by each of the other Raytheon Parties (other
than RECI) to execute and deliver this Agreement on behalf of each such Raytheon
Party and that this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligation

                                             27

<PAGE>

of each such Raytheon Party to the same extent as if such Raytheon Party
executed and delivered this Agreement on its own behalf. In the event of any
breach of the foregoing representation and warranty, Raytheon and RECI jointly
and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the WGI Parties from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages and expenses of every nature
and character arising out such breach.

                (c)     WGI Parties. WGI represents and warrants that it is duly
authorized and empowered by each of the other WGI Parties (other than WGI Ohio
and the other WGI Parties that are signatories hereto) to execute and deliver
this Agreement on behalf of each such WGI Party and that this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each such
WGI Party to the same extent as if such WGI Party executed and delivered this
Agreement on its own behalf. In the event of any breach of the foregoing
representation and warranty, WGI and WGI Ohio jointly and severally agree to
indemnify and hold harmless the Raytheon Parties from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages and expenses of every nature and character arising
out such breach.

                Section 8.16 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Consent to Suit.
(a) This Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York notwithstanding any conflict of laws provision in the
State of New York or elsewhere that would dictate the application of the law of
any other jurisdiction.

                (b)     The Raytheon Parties, the WGI Parties, and the Committee
agree that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes relating to the Plan and the
exhibits to the Plan to the fullest extent provided under applicable law,
including, without limitation, issues under this Agreement and the Raytheon
Settlement Provisions and Documents, until the closing of the Bankruptcy Case,
except that all disputes relating solely to the Services Agreement shall be
resolved as provided in Section 18 of the Services Agreement.

                (c)     To the extent that the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Nevada no longer has jurisdiction over the Plan or any
related matter, the Parties agree that any proceeding to enforce this Agreement
shall be brought in the courts of the State of New York or any federal court
sitting therein.

                (d)     Each of the Parties hereby waives any present or future
objection to such venue, and irrevocably consents and submits unconditionally to
the

                                       28

<PAGE>

exclusive jurisdiction for itself and in respect of any of its property of any
such court. Each of the Parties further irrevocably waives any claim that such
court is not a convenient forum for any such proceeding. Each of the Parties
agrees that any service of process, writ, judgment or other notice of legal
process shall be deemed and held in every respect to be effectively served up on
it if sent to such Party in the manner and at the address specified in Section
8.19. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any
manner permitted by applicable law.

                (e)     EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY
RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT
DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY BE IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
ARISING FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND
AGREES THAT THE FINDER OF FACT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE THE
TRIAL JUDGE AND NOT A JURY.

                (f)     Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to
claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section
8.16 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

                Section 8.17 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Services
Agreement, the Mutual Release and other documents and agreements expressly
referred to herein represent the entire agreement between the Parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof, except to the extent express reference is
made herein to any other agreement or writing, and may be amended or varied only
in writing by duly authorized representatives of the Parties. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as modified by and to the extent provided in Section 8.2,
the Disaffiliation Tax Sharing Agreement shall exclusively govern all matters
that are the subject thereof. The Parties expressly waive all provisions
contained in any past agreement, including, without limitation, the Stock
Purchase Agreement, or correspondence that negates, limits, modifies,
supplements, extends or conflicts with the provisions hereof. The language used
in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied
against any Party.

                Section 8.18 Assignment. Subject to Section 9-406 of the Uniform
Commercial Code (as revised), no Party shall be entitled to transfer or assign
its

                                       29

<PAGE>

rights and liabilities provided for herein to any third Person without the
written approval from all other Parties, except that any Raytheon Parties may
assign to a Support Agreement Surety some or all of its rights under this
Agreement, the Separate Agreements or the Services Agreement, as applicable,
with respect to a project covered by or subject to a Support Agreement.

                Section 8.19 Notices. Any and all notices pursuant to this
Agreement can be validly given by (a) hand or courier, (b) telefax (with

*This schedule lists certain guarantees, letters of credit and surely bonds
previously issued or obtained by Raytheon Company ("Raytheon") or Raytheon
Engineers & Constructors International, Inc. ("RECI"). Nothing on this schedule
constitutes an acknowledgement or admission by Raytheon or RECI that it is
obligated under any of the listed support agreements. This schedule also may not
list all of the applicable support agreements. A support agreement's absence
from this schedule does not constitute an acknowledgment or admission by
Raytheon or RECI that such support agreement should not be treated in the same
manner as the other items included herein. In addition, WGI to confirm that
surety bonds and guarantees relate to an Assumed Project. If not, to be deleted
from schedule. The two letters of credit associated with the San Roque Project
are currently in the process of being replaced with letters of credit from a
different financial institution.

                   CONDITIONS TO DRAWS UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT

                        (a) Raytheon shall not submit a draw under the Raytheon
LOC in connection with its making a payment unless and until:

                1.      Raytheon or RECI shall have made payment under, for the
reimbursement of or in connection with an Assumed Project Support Agreement;

                2.      Raytheon shall have made commercially reasonable efforts
to provide WGI with notice of such payment (in advance of any payment, if
practicable) and, unless in Raytheon's judgment doing so could in any way
prejudice Raytheon or RECI, permit WGI a period of three(3) business days to
reimburse Raytheon in full for such payment, however, that its failure to comply
with this paragraph 2 shall not constitute a basis for preventing a drawing
under the Raytheon LOC; and

                3.      Raytheon or RECI shall not have received payment, in
full, for such payment, from WGI.

Notwithstanding the foregoing conditions, Raytheon may make draws under the
Raytheon LOC if, as and when WGI, (i) fails to pay its debts generally as they
come due, (ii) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy filed against it (not withdrawn or dismissed with thirty
(30) days) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of foreign
law, (iii) undertakes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (iv) fails
to extend the expiry date of the Raytheon LOC for not less than six (6) months
by the twentieth (20th) day prior to its scheduled expiry date.

                        (b) In addition, Raytheon shall be permitted to draw
under the Raytheon LOC for amounts paid by it or RECI for the fees and expenses
related to maintaining an Assumed Project Support Agreement, provided, however,
that Raytheon shall have provided WGI with an invoice setting forth in
reasonable detail the amounts to be paid and WGI shall not have reimbursed
Raytheon for such amount within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such invoice.

2.      SERVICES TO BE RENDERED

        a)      Consultant agrees to provide personnel under the direction of
                Client to undertake and perform certain services as and to the
                extent requested by Client from time to time in accordance with
                the terms and conditions herein. The services will generally
                include services to complete all or some of the former
                obligations of Consultant and its Affiliates to third parties
                under the rejected contracts relating to the Projects
                ("Completion Services"), including (i) completion of physical
                work required and (ii) any routine project close-out activities
                such as obtaining final payments, resolving commercial issues
                and disputes with clients, subcontractors and vendors,
                confirming warranty completion, closing out contracts and
                subcontracts and obtaining final releases, and making foreign
                statutory filings, but excluding providing any support in
                connection with any litigation or arbitration except as provided
                in Section 4(b) (with the Completion Services referred to in
                clause (ii) sometimes referred to as "Routine Close-Out
                Services"). For the avoidance of doubt, Consultant shall not be
                responsible under this Agreement for any performance guarantees,
                emissions guarantees, schedule guarantees, and any other
                guarantee or warranty set forth in the engineering, procurement
                and/or construction or other agreements relating to the
                applicable Project (the "Project Agreements").

        b)      The Completion Services to be performed shall be generally as
                described in Schedule 2(b) attached hereto. From time to time,
                Client and Consultant may modify or expand the Completion
                Services by a mutually agreed upon written amendment to this
                Agreement. Consultant will perform the Completion Services under
                Client's direction and control as more fully described in a Work
                Order (defined below) for each Project.

        c)      The Completion Services will be performed by the employees of
                Consultant and its Affiliates selected by Consultant and
                approved by Client in advance. To the extent commercially

                                        4

<PAGE>

                practicable Consultant will furnish employees to provide
                Completion Services that have prior experience and knowledge
                with respect to the applicable Project. Notwithstanding the
                provisions of this Section 2, Consultant personnel shall not be
                required to provide any Completion Services in Pakistan or other
                foreign country in connection with any Project unless (i)
                Consultant is reasonably satisfied regarding safety and security
                in Pakistan or such other foreign country, and (ii) in the case
                of Pakistan only, Consultant is satisfied, in its sole and
                absolute discretion, regarding its exposure to legal liability
                to judgments or other legal process. In the event that
                Consultant is not reasonably satisfied regarding safety and
                security in Pakistan or such other foreign country, Consultant
                shall notify Client of such concerns, and the parties shall meet
                to discuss such concerns, and to, in good faith, enter into an
                alternative arrangements.

        d)      In the event that Client requests Consultant to provide
                Completion Services with respect to a Project, Client will
                notify Consultant of the initial scope of Completion Services
                requested and the parties will meet (either in person or by
                conference call) to discuss the Completion Services to be
                provided and the appropriate staffing for the Completion
                Services. Within one week after such meeting, Client and
                Consultant will prepare and agree upon a work order that refers
                to this Agreement and describes the initial scope of Completion
                Services to be provided with respect to the Project and the
                initial staffing (a "Work Order"). The Work Order for any
                Project will also designate the principal contacts for either
                party with respect to such Project (the "Work Order Liaisons").
                Unless otherwise agreed by the Client and the Consultant, each
                Work Order shall generally be in the form of Schedule 2(d). On
                any Project the applicable Work Order shall set forth all budget
                requirements (including the requirement for any periodic
                estimates), staffing plans, schedule estimates, payment terms,
                funding mechanics and reconciliation procedures to be applied on
                such Project, in the event the budget, payment and
                reconciliation procedures will be different from those set forth
                in Section 12(b). In the case of any conflict between the terms
                of any Work Order and the general terms contained herein, the
                terms of any Work Order shall control.

        e)      The Completion Services also shall include provision of craft
                labor for each Project from time to time as requested by Client
                and as agreed to by the Parties in a Work Order. Such craft
                labor is excluded from the requirements of Section 2(c) above
                but any hiring of craft labor is subject to the prior approval
                of Client. Craft labor will be reimbursed at cost including all
                applicable fringe benefits, payroll taxes and insurance.

        f)      Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement,
                Consultant shall recommend to Client, and the applicable Work
                Order shall reflect, the employees and number and type of craft
                labor necessary to perform Completion Services. Client shall be
                solely responsible for determining such level of effort
                necessary to perform the Completion Services in accordance with
                the related Work Order.

        g)      In the event that Client terminates Consultant's services with
                respect to any Project, Client shall not solicit for employment
                any of the employees identified in the applicable Work Order as
                providing Completion Services for such Project, and Client shall
                use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any proposed
                contractor retained to replace Consultant (a "Replacement
                Contractor") to similarly not solicit such employees for the
                period beginning upon the date of this Agreement and, (i) in the
                case of a termination where such termination follows
                Consultant's receipt of a notice of and failure to timely cure
                or commence and continue reasonable efforts to timely cure any
                condition or event which in the reasonable

                                        5

<PAGE>

                judgment of Client is likely to cause a material delay in the
                applicable Project schedule or cause any category of costs in
                the applicable Project budget to be materially exceeded or
                materially adversely affect the execution of the Completion
                Services, ending upon the date five (5) days from such notice,
                and (ii) in the case of any other termination, ending upon the
                date 120 days from the notice of such termination.

        h)      In the event that because a particular Project had been
                previously performed by an Affiliate of Consultant or for any
                other reason, in order to effectuate the intent of this
                Agreement performance of any obligations of Consultant under
                this Agreement are required to be performed by any of
                Consultant's Affiliates, the Consultant will cause such
                Affiliate to perform the applicable obligations under this
                Agreement, and the Client will accept performance by such
                Affiliate. The Parties will describe in the applicable Work
                Order whether or not performance by an Affiliate of Consultant
                is anticipated to be required.

3.      RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLETION SERVICES

        a)      Consultant warrants to perform the Completion Services in
                accordance with that degree of care and skill ordinarily
                exercised by members of the engineering and construction
                profession existing as of the date this Agreement became
                effective and in accordance with the performance standards that
                previously applied to the performance by Consultant and its
                Affiliates of their obligations under the applicable Project
                Agreements, which shall be set forth in each Work Order (in each
                case the "Specified Obligations"); provided, however, that the
                only remedy hereunder and Consultant's only liability, unless
                Consultant or one of its Affiliates has performed with willful
                misconduct or gross negligence, for the failure by Consultant or
                one of its Affiliates to perform in accordance with the
                Specified Obligations shall be, at Client's option, (i)
                termination pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) Consultant or one
                of its Affiliates shall re-perform all non-complying work on a
                cost-reimbursable basis, in accordance with the terms and
                conditions hereof; provided, however, no Fee or profit of any
                kind shall be payable by Client with respect to such
                re-performance work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant
                or one of its Affiliates shall not be responsible under this
                Agreement for any performance guarantees, emissions guarantees,
                schedule guarantees, and any other guarantee or warranty set
                forth in any Project Agreements.

        b)      Because Consultant and its Affiliates and their employees are
                under Client's direction and control, Consultant and its
                directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates shall have
                no liability to Client or to third parties for injuries or
                alleged injuries to persons (including death), or for damages or
                alleged damages to property, including Client's property and any
                Project owner's property, arising out of or in connection with
                these Completion Services, except to the extent arising out of
                Consultant's or one of its Affiliate's gross negligence or
                willful misconduct.

4.      CONSULTANT'S ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS.

        a)      Consultant's Indemnity. In performing its obligations under this
                Agreement, Consultant shall be responsible for, and shall
                indemnify, defend and hold Client and its subsidiaries and all
                directors, officers, employees and/or agents of the foregoing
                harmless against, any and all claims, liabilities, expenses,
                damages, losses, costs, judgments, demands and suits (including
                reasonable attorneys' fees) ("Losses") arising from the gross
                negligence or willful misconduct of Consultant or its Affiliates
                in the performance or nonperformance of

                                        6

<PAGE>

                Consultant's obligations under this Agreement; provided,
                however, that in any case in which Consultant uses commercially
                reasonable efforts to perform and comply with its obligations
                hereunder and takes all reasonable steps to abide by the
                directions of Client and the terms of this Agreement, Consultant
                and its Affiliates shall be deemed not to have breached such
                obligations.

        b)      Claims Support. To the extent requested by Client for a
                particular Project, as part of the Completion Services,
                Consultant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
                diligently pursue, settle, investigate, negotiate (or, as
                necessary, defend) change orders and claims for equitable
                adjustment and other claims relating to the performance of
                Completion Services pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
                that Project, including any claims for warranty or for
                non-complying work or delivery, against the Project owner,
                customers, suppliers, subcontractors, vendors and non-contract
                parties (collectively, "Project Completion Claims"), other than
                those Project Completion Claims that Consultant reasonably
                believes are not commercially reasonable (and in the case of
                defending Project Completion Claims, that Consultant reasonably
                believes are not commercially reasonable to defend); provided
                that Consultant shall not be required to litigate, arbitrate or
                assume the defense of any Project Completion Claim in its own
                name, although the Consultant acknowledges that it may be sued
                in its own name and will be required to litigate such claim, in
                its own name, subject to Client's obligations to indemnify
                Consultant as provided in Section 6 hereof. For the avoidance of
                doubt, the Consultant and Client acknowledge that any claims
                relating to the Projects but not relating to the performance of
                Completion Services pursuant to this Agreement or not
                constituting part of the Routine Close-Out Services, including
                without limitation the resolution in the Bankruptcy Court of
                claims asserted by third parties as unsecured claims in
                connection with the Bankruptcy Filing, shall not be pursued or
                defended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, but shall be
                subject to the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement.
                Consultant's pursuit or defense, if any, of Project Completion
                Claims shall be at the direction and under the control of
                Client. Consultant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
                assist Client in pursuing, litigating, arbitrating or defending
                against any Project Completion Claims, and Client shall take the
                lead role in such process. In the event that Consultant
                reasonably believes such Project Completion Claims are not
                commercially reasonable, or that the defense of such Project
                Completion Claims is not commercially reasonable, and Client
                wishes to pursue or defend such Project Completion Claim,
                Consultant agrees to provide, diligently and in good faith, all
                documentation, information, access, and access to (but not use
                of) personnel requested by Client. Without limiting the
                generality of the foregoing, it shall be deemed reasonable for
                Client to request to meet with witnesses in advance of any
                testimony they may be asked or required to give at a deposition
                or hearing of any sort relating to Project Completion Claims and
                to have the witnesses furnished by Consultant travel to the
                location of any hearing

        c)      Good Standing. Consultant shall maintain its existence and good
                standing and the existence and good standing of any Affiliate
                performing Completion Services, until performance is completed.

        d)      Permits and Licenses. Consultant shall maintain the existence
                and effectiveness of all permits necessary for performance by
                Consultant or its Affiliates of any Completion Services
                hereunder, and such maintenance shall constitute part of the
                Completion Services to be performed by Consultant under this
                Agreement.

5.      WARRANTY EXCLUSION

        a)      Consultant's sole liability to Client for any Completion
                Services that fail to meet the standard set forth in Section
                3(a) or set forth in any Work Order and that do not constitute
                gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be to reperform
                the non-conforming Completion Services, written notice of which
                must be promptly given after discovery by Client to Consultant.
                Consultant's obligation for reperformance of non-conforming
                Completion Services shall begin at Work Order completion, and
                extend for a term of one (1) year thereafter. Any costs of
                reperformance will be an Allowable Cost under this Agreement,
                but Consultant will not be entitled to any Fee for such
                reperformance. The Consultant's liability for gross negligence
                or willful misconduct is set forth in Section 4(a).

        b)      The only warranties made by Consultant are those expressly
                enumerated in Section 3 above. Any other statements of fact or
                descriptions expressed in this Agreement or any attachments
                hereto shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty of the
                Completion Services or any part thereof. THE WARRANTIES SET
                FORTH IN SECTION 3 A) above ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ANY AND
                ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS, OR IMPLIED
                (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE(S) AND
                ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING AND/OR
                USAGE OF TRADE). The remedies provided in Section 5(a) above are
                Client's sole and exclusive remedies for any failure of
                Consultant to comply with the warranties in Section (3a) and are
                expressly in lieu of any and all other warranties of any kind
                whatsoever, as stated above. Except as provided in Section 4(a)
                with respect to gross negligence or willful misconduct,
                correction of any nonconformity in Completion Services in the
                manner and for the period of time provided above shall
                constitute complete fulfillment of all the liabilities and
                warranties of Consultant for any and all defective or
                nonconforming Completion Services whether the claims of Client
                are based upon contract, tort (including but not limited to
                negligence and strict liability), errors or omissions,
                warranties, indemnity or otherwise with respect to or arising
                out of any Completion Services performed hereunder.

6.      QUALITY ASSURANCE; INDEMNITY BY CLIENT

        a)      Performance by Consultant of any quality assurance, vendor
                assurance, project management, construction management, or other
                third party oversight or advisory services shall in no way
                constitute an assumption by Consultant, or by any of its
                suppliers or subcontractors of any tier, of, or relieve a Client
                or its consultants or suppliers from, any responsibility for
                delivery of any services, materials, equipment and documentation
                in strict accordance with the requirements of the consultant,
                manufacturer, or supplier/Client contract.

        b)      Client agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Consultant
                and its Affiliates and any and all directors, officers,
                employees and/or agents of the foregoing (collectively, the
                "Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses of any kind
                and nature whatsoever, arising from the Consultant's performance
                of this Agreement.

        c)      Notwithstanding paragraph (b) above, or any provision to the
                contrary contained herein, Client shall not indemnify, hold
                harmless, or defend the Indemnitees with regard to Losses of any
                kind or nature whatsoever to the proportionate extent that such
                Losses:

                                        8

<PAGE>

                (i)     arise from any Indemnitee's breach of this Agreement,
                        other than any breach of the Specified Obligations or
                        other failure to perform any Completion Services in the
                        manner required by this Agreement that does not arise
                        from any Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful
                        misconduct;

                (ii)    arise from any Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful
                        misconduct;

                (iii)   are covered by the collected proceeds of any insurance
                        policy covering the applicable Project, to the extent of
                        such proceeds;

                (iv)    are the responsibility of WGI Delaware under the WGI
                        Guaranty; or

                (v)     arise under or relate to the prior performance of any of
                        the Project Agreements or any other subcontract, vendor
                        contract or other contract relating to any Project that
                        were rejected by Consultant or any Affiliates and that
                        was asserted or could have been asserted as a claim (as
                        defined in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code)
                        against the Debtors, or any of them, as part of the
                        Bankruptcy Case.

        d)      Solely with respect to the Ratchaburi project, the Client shall
                also indemnify Consultant and its affiliates for valid claims of
                General Electric Company and its affiliates (collectively, "GE")
                for payments made and liabilities incurred to vendors and
                subcontractors of Consultant and its affiliates after May 14,
                2001 and prior to the date of this Agreement as a result of the
                non-performance by Consultant and its affiliates during this
                period.

7.      FORCE MAJEURE

        Any delay or failure of Consultant in performing its required
        obligations hereunder shall be excused if and to the extent it is caused
        by a Force Majeure event. A "Force Majeure" event shall mean an event
        due to any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of Consultant
        and shall include, but not be limited to, acts or orders of any
        governmental body or changes in laws or government regulations or
        interpretations or application thereof, acts or omissions of Client or
        its other consultants, acts of God, war, riot, fire, flood, explosion,
        hurricane, tornado, epidemic, earthquake, transportation accidents,
        terrorism, sabotage or strikes. In such event, the time for performance
        hereunder shall be extended for a period of time sufficient to overcome
        the effects of such delay, and Consultant's compensation shall be
        equitably adjusted to reflect any increased costs of performance of the
        Completion Services.

8.      INSURANCE

        a)      Upon Client's written request, Consultant shall effect and
                maintain insurance with the following limits:

                (i)     Workers' compensation for statutory limits in compliance
                        with the applicable state and federal laws and
                        employers' liability with a limit of $2,000,000.

                (ii)    Comprehensive general liability including
                        products/completed operations, contractual coverage for
                        the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 4(a)
                        and

                                        9

<PAGE>

                        broad form property damage with the limits of $5,000,000
                        any occurrence and in the aggregate, combined for bodily
                        and personal injury and property damage.

                (iii)   Automobile liability including owned, non-owned, and
                        leased automobiles with the limits of $5,000,000 any one
                        occurrence and in the aggregate, combined single limit
                        for bodily injury and property damage.

                (iv)    Professional liability with a limit of $10,000,000 and a
                        deductible or self insured retention of $2,000,000 for
                        any one occurrence and in the aggregate.

        b)      If requested by Client, Consultant shall furnish to Client
                certificates of insurance signed by the insurers, indicating
                that policies with respect to the aforementioned insurance have
                been issued and that such policies contain provisions regarding
                prior notification of cancellation.

        c)      Consultant and Client each waive all rights of recovery against
                a loss occurring to property of the other, to the extent that
                such waivers do not invalidate the property insurance of either.

        d)      In the event Client makes a claim against Consultant covered by
                the professional liability insurance coverage, Client shall
                receive any proceeds resulting from such claim net of the
                deductible or self insured retention by Consultant or its
                Affiliates.

        e)      To the extent permitted under the applicable Project Agreements,
                Client and Consultant agree that any insurance coverage provided
                by the project owners under the Project Agreements shall be
                primary, and that insurance provided by Consultant shall be
                excess and non-contributory.

        f)      Client and Consultant also agree to review any insurance
                coverage provided by project owners under the applicable Project
                Agreements so that the coverages required to be maintained in
                Section 8(a) may be reduced and the resultant cost can be
                reduced, each at the mutual agreement of Client and Consultant.

9.      WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES

        As it relates to performance of Completion Services under this
        Agreement, neither Consultant nor Client nor their respective employees,
        officers, directors, affiliates, consultants, agents and subcontractors
        or suppliers of any tier, if any, shall be liable for any special,
        indirect, punitive, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages of
        any nature, including, without limitation, any loss of actual or
        anticipated profits or revenues, loss by reason of shutdown, operation,
        non-operation, or increased expense of operation, loss of use, cost of
        capital, cost of replacement power and any other loss due to power
        outages, damage to or loss of property or equipment of Client or project
        owners, or claims of customers of Client or project owners, regardless
        of whether due to or based upon delay, contract, warranty, tort,
        negligence, strict liability, error or omission, indemnity or otherwise.

10.     HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE

        a)      Consultant shall not be liable or responsible for any hazardous
                waste, toxic substance, pollution or contamination that (i)
                Consultant does not introduce into or onto a Project site in a
                manner that violates this Agreement or the applicable Work
                Order; and (ii) that is not used,

                                       10

<PAGE>

                generated, treated or handled by Consultant, at any time, on the
                Project site(s) in a manner that violates this Agreement or the
                applicable Work Order.

        b)      Consultant shall not introduce any hazardous waste, toxic
                substance, pollution or contamination into any Project site
                without the prior authorization of Client, other than materials,
                fuels or substances used in the ordinary course of performing
                Client's obligations under this Agreement and the applicable
                Work Order.

        c)      Client shall indemnify Consultant for any direct loss or
                liability sustained by Consultant to the proportionate extent
                such loss or liability is associated with any such hazardous
                waste, toxic substance, pollution or contamination that does not
                fall within the scope of (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above.

11.     CHANGES

        Client may from time to time seek to modify, extend or enlarge the
        Completion Services being performed with respect to a particular Project
        by written instructions to Consultant to perform additional Completion
        Services, modify the schedule or direct the omission of work previously
        ordered. In the event Client requests that Consultant perform additional
        Completion Services, or make other modifications to the Completion
        Services, the existing Work Order will be revised to reflect such
        changes. In no event, however, shall Consultant be obligated to perform
        such additional services or modify or extend such services without prior
        written amendment to an existing Work Order signed by Client and
        accepted in writing by Consultant. In addition, Client may from time to
        time direct Consultant to cease performing one or more of the Completion
        Services that Consultant had been previously performing. Costs
        associated with the Completion Services contemplated prior to the change
        that had been incurred prior to the time the change could reasonably
        take effect, any field demobilization costs required as a result of the
        termination of work or change in scope, and any additional Completion
        Services requested by Client to be performed in connection with such
        termination of work or change in scope, shall all constitute Allowable
        Costs hereunder to the extent incurred in accordance with the rates and
        charges referred to in Schedule 12(a).

12.     PAYMENT TERMS

        a)      Work Orders. All payment terms shall be as specified in the
                applicable Work Order for any Project. In general, and unless
                specifically set forth and agreed by Client and Consultant to
                the contrary in this Agreement or such Work Order, Consultant
                shall be paid, in advance, for all Allowable Costs, plus a fee
                in the amount of 7.50% of such Allowable Costs (the "Fee").
                Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Work Order,
                Allowable Costs will be calculated in accordance with the terms
                and conditions set forth on Schedule 12(a).

        b)      Default Budget; Funding; Reconciliation. Unless otherwise agreed
                to by the Parties in a Work Order, for any Project for which
                Consultant shall perform any Completion Services:

                        (i) Consultant shall prepare a budget, and semi-monthly
                updates, containing Consultant's reasonable estimate of the
                anticipated costs of performing such services through completion
                of such services, broken down by cost element;

                        (ii) Consultant shall notify Client no less than
                fourteen (14) days in advance of the start of any two week
                period in which services are to be performed of the anticipated
                Allowable Costs to be expended by Consultant for such two week
                period, and at the request

                                       11

<PAGE>

                of Client, Consultant shall meet and confer with Client
                regarding the amounts to be funded thereby;

                        (iii) no less than (3) business days in advance of such
                two-week period, Client shall wire funds to Consultant for such
                two week period, in an amount not less than the amount requested
                by Client, or the amount agreed to by the Parties after having
                met and conferred, taking into account any credits or debits
                from any prior period; and

                        (iv) Consultant shall provide a monthly reconciliation
                to Client, no later than twenty one (21) days following the end
                of any month in which services were performed, of the costs
                actually incurred during such month, and the Parties shall make
                such debits or credits as are appropriate.

        c)      In House Costs. Consultant may include as Labor Costs the costs
                of in-house counsel and other administrative personnel
                performing any of the Completion Services, provided the costs of
                such personnel are incurred in connection with, and budgeted or
                otherwise approved in compliance with, the applicable Work Order
                and provided further that any use of in-house tax personnel must
                be approved in advance by Client.

        d)      No Prior Amounts. No amounts spent by Consultant or its
                Affiliates on a Project that were spent prior to, or not in
                connection with this Agreement, shall constitute an Allowable
                Cost (or an Accrued Cost), unless such amounts are approved by
                Client, in writing, in a Work Order for such Project pursuant to
                the terms hereof. Client has previously approved the Allowable
                Costs relating to certain Projects listed on Schedule 12(c)
                hereto, and such Allowable Costs shall be paid within five (5)
                business days after the date of this Agreement. Certain other
                costs listed on Schedule 12(c) are subject to review and mutual
                agreement as described in Schedule 12(c).

        e)      No Duplication. No amount payable by Client under this
                Agreement, for Allowable Costs, for indemnity, or otherwise,
                shall be payable, or paid, to Consultant more than once.
                Consultant shall not include any item in any request for payment
                or reimbursement for which Consultant has already been paid by
                Client under any other agreement or arrangement with respect to
                the Project.

        f)      Audit Rights. Client shall have reasonable access during normal
                business hours to Consultant's books and records as necessary to
                verify the number of manhours actually charged in a given work
                week, all Out-of-Pocket costs, including subcontractor and
                vendor payments, any Taxes, and the application of the
                appropriate rates and multipliers to the man- hours charged.
                Client shall not have audit rights with respect to the agreed
                upon multiplier rates set forth in Schedule 12(a) for Labor
                Costs and certain Out-of-Pocket Costs.

        g)      Tax Cooperation. Consultant shall cooperate with Client, prior
                to or following the expiration or earlier termination of this
                Agreement, to obtain Tax refunds from any applicable taxing
                authorities for the benefit of Client, for any Taxes paid by
                Client, or reimbursed to Consultant, pursuant to this Agreement,
                or any other prior arrangement between the Parties. Client shall
                compensate Consultant (at rates and fees substantially similar
                to the rates and fees for work or services performed hereunder)
                for any work performed under this paragraph (f) following the
                termination or expiration of this Agreement. The parties shall
                endeavor to minimize Taxes payable in connection with the
                Completion Services, to the extent permitted

                                       12

<PAGE>

                by law. Any refunds for Taxes that are governed by the Tax
                Agreement will be pursued and remitted as provided in the Tax
                Agreement.

        h)      Set off. Client agrees to fund its obligations to make payments
                pursuant to the applicable Work Order notwithstanding any right
                of set-off or recoupment that Client may have or allege against
                any sums due under this Agreement.

13.     INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT

        Consultant is an independent contractor. Neither Consultant, nor any of
        its employees, are or shall be deemed to be agents or employees of
        Client. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement,
        Consultant may at its sole discretion, discharge any of its employees
        for cause.

14.     OWNERSHIP OF DOCUMENTS

        All right, title and interest in all (without limitation) data,
        analyses, drafts, reports, drawings, prints, records, notebooks,
        manuals, computer printouts or intellectual property delivered to Client
        under this Agreement or generated solely in the performance of the
        Completion Services shall become the property of Client and such
        documents shall be delivered to Client upon Client's full and complete
        payment for such Completion Services. Client agrees to hold harmless and
        indemnify Consultant against any and all damages, claims, causes of
        action, expenses, liabilities, costs and losses, including, but not
        limited to, defense costs and attorneys' fees, arising out of any reuse
        by Client or others of the materials, data, or reports for any other
        projects or matters unrelated to the Projects without the written
        authorization of Consultant. Client expressly agrees that it shall not
        and is not authorized to so use any such documents without such
        authorization. Client hereby grants to Consultant the unrestricted,
        royalty free right to retain copies of these materials and to use these
        materials and the information contained therein, on a world wide basis,
        in the normal course of Consultant's business for any and all lawful
        purposes subject to the confidentiality provisions hereof.

        In the course of performance of its Completion Services Consultant may
        rely upon information supplied by Client or Client's partners,
        contractors, or consultants, or information available from generally
        accepted reputable sources without independent verification. Consultant
        shall have no liability for defects in its Completion Services
        attributable to Consultant's reliance upon or use of data, design
        criteria, drawings, specifications or other information furnished by
        Client.

15.     TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION

        a)      Client shall have the right to terminate this Agreement prior to
                completion of the Completion Services after delivery of ten (10)
                days written notice to Consultant, in which event Client shall
                pay Consultant all amounts due up to the effective date of
                termination plus all Allowable Costs incurred in connection with
                field demobilization required as a result of such termination.
                To the extent that Client requests that Consultant perform
                services post-termination, Consultant shall be paid its actual
                costs, based upon Allowable Costs, plus Fees.

        b)      Consultant may suspend performance on a Work Order for
                non-payment of amounts due on a Work Order after five (5) days
                notice. In addition, Consultant may terminate performance under
                such Work Order after thirty (30) days cumulative suspension for
                non-payment.

                                       13

        c)      In the event that Client or Consultant terminates the Completion
                Services with respect to a particular Work Order (a "Partial
                Termination") or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
                paragraph a) above, any and all amounts previously paid to
                Consultant and not disbursed to pay Allowable Costs or Fee
                pursuant to the applicable Work Order, in the case of a Partial
                Termination only insofar as it relates to the applicable Work
                Order, shall be immediately disbursed to Client, inclusive of
                all interest thereon or credits owing thereto, without any
                set-off or deduction of any kind other than Allowable Costs to
                be reimbursed pursuant to this Agreement, including Consultant's
                field demobilization costs that are reimbursable pursuant to
                this Agreement, plus the portion of any Fee earned prior to the
                date of termination. Consultant will also remit directly back to
                Client any and all amounts received under this Agreement that
                remain unspent as of the termination date, in the case if a
                Partial Termination only insofar as it relates to the applicable
                Project.

16.     TERM

        Unless otherwise specified, the term of this Agreement shall be no more
        than five (5) years from the Effective Date, subject to earlier
        termination as herein provided. In addition, provided that Consultant
        provides ninety (90) days' prior written notice, Consultant will not be
        required to provide Completion Services after the second anniversary of
        the date of this Agreement and at any time thereafter, Consultant shall
        be permitted to terminate this Agreement or any Work Order, insofar as
        it relates to any Completion Services, upon ninety (90) days written
        notice to Client. Consultant and Client may mutually agree upon an
        extension of this Agreement. Such extension must be in writing and
        signed by both Consultant and Client.

17.     CLIENT ACCESS

        a)      For purposes of the overall administration of this Agreement,
                Client and Consultant shall each appoint a single representative
                (the "Project Liaisons"), who shall coordinate all matters
                relating to this Agreement. If and to the extent that the
                Consultant's Project Liaison performs services for Consultant
                that are related to this Agreement, the costs related to such
                services shall constitute Allowable Costs related to this
                Agreement.

        b)      Work Order Liaisons. As noted in Section 2, the applicable Work
                Order will designate the "Work Order Liaisons" for the Projects.
                For purposes of administering this Agreement each party shall be
                entitled to rely upon the direction of the other party's Work
                Order Liaison.

        c)      Client Access. Client will be entitled to place a reasonable
                number of employees, consultants or representatives on-site at
                the applicable Project and, during regular business hours, at
                the Consultant's Princeton offices to observe and supervise the
                performance by the Consultant of its obligations under this
                Agreement, and Client and its representatives, including any
                third party consultant retained by Client, will be permitted to
                have access to and examine and take copies of any documents,
                books, records, materials and other information, whether in
                tangible or electronic form, relating to the applicable Project,
                including any and all engineering, procurement and construction
                documents, purchase orders, invoices, specifications, progress
                reports, plans and designs. With regards to access to
                Consultant's Princeton, New Jersey, offices, (i) access shall be
                given during normal business hours, and (ii) Client's personnel
                shall be subject to Consultant's prior approval, such approval
                not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In addition to those
                personnel subject to the foregoing approval process, Consultant
                expressly will pre-approve and permit

                                       14

<PAGE>

                the persons listed on Schedule 17 to have access to the
                Princeton facilities. The Consultant shall provide Client with
                copies of all internal and external project reports and
                correspondence as generated or received relating to the
                applicable Project. The Project Liaisons will conduct periodic
                Project reviews and progress meetings as requested by Client.
                The Consultant shall not designate a replacement Project Liaison
                without the consent of Client, which consent shall not be
                unreasonably withheld or delayed. Consultant's costs in
                complying with the obligations contained in this Section 17
                shall constitute Allowable Costs.

18.     DISPUTE RESOLUTION

        a)      All disputes or claims arising in respect of a particular
                Project shall be referred to the Project Liaisons for
                settlement. In the event no settlement can be reached pursuant
                to the preceding sentence within one (1) week, then senior
                management of Client and Consultant shall attempt to resolve
                such dispute or claim within ten (10) business days. In the
                event the senior management cannot settle such disputes or
                claims, such disputes or claims shall be settled pursuant to the
                arbitration procedures set forth in Section 18(b) hereof.

        b)      (i)     Subject to the other provisions of this Section 18, any
                        party hereto may commence arbitration in conformity with
                        and under the rules of the American Arbitration
                        Association ("AAA"), and, notwithstanding anything to
                        the contrary contained herein, such arbitration shall be
                        governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
                        the State of New York, USA.

                (ii)    The arbitral tribunal shall consist of three
                        arbitrators. Each party hereto shall appoint one
                        arbitrator with, in the case of a dispute of a technical
                        nature, knowledge and experience in such technical
                        matters. The two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint
                        the third arbitrator who shall serve as the chairman of
                        the arbitral tribunal. If a party fails to appoint its
                        arbitrator within a period of ten (10) days after
                        receiving notice of the arbitration, or if the two
                        arbitrators appointed cannot agree on the third
                        arbitrator within a period of ten (10) days after
                        appointment of the second arbitrator, then such third
                        arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the procedures
                        of the AAA Rules.

                (iii)   In the event an arbitrator is appointed pursuant to the
                        last sentence of the foregoing subsection (ii), such
                        arbitrator shall be a person with experience in
                        commercial agreements and, in particular, the
                        implementation and interpretation of contracts relating
                        to the design, engineering, construction, operation and
                        maintenance of international electrical power generating
                        facilities which have been financed on a limited
                        recourse basis (and if the dispute concerns a technical
                        issue, a person who has knowledge and experience in
                        technical matters). No arbitrator shall be a present or
                        former employee or agent of, or consultant or counsel
                        to, either party hereto or any affiliate thereof.

                (iv)    The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New
                        York, U.S.A., and shall apply English as the language of
                        the arbitration proceedings. All documents or evidence
                        presented at such arbitration in a language other than
                        in English shall be accompanied by a certified English
                        translation thereof. The arbitrators shall apply, and
                        shall be bound by, the applicable rules of law and the
                        terms of this Agreement. Unless the Parties hereto agree
                        otherwise in writing, the arbitrators shall be permitted
                        to order the parties to an arbitration to engage in
                        discovery (including the

                                       15

<PAGE>

                        taking of depositions). The arbitrators shall decide the
                        dispute by majority of the arbitral tribunal and shall
                        state in writing the reasons for its decision. Any
                        monetary award of the arbitral tribunal shall be
                        denominated in U.S. dollars and shall be paid by the
                        earlier of (i) the time period specified by the arbitral
                        tribunal and (ii) thirty (30) days after the arbitral
                        tribunal notifies the parties of receiving such award.
                        The parties agree to direct the arbitral tribunal to
                        complete the arbitration proceeding, and issue a
                        decision, within sixty (60) days after the submission of
                        the request for arbitration.

                (v)     The parties hereby waive any rights to appeal or to
                        review such award by any court or tribunal, and such
                        award shall be final and binding. The parties hereto
                        further undertake to carry out without delay the
                        provisions of any arbitral award or order, and each
                        agrees that any such award or order shall be conclusive
                        and may be enforced in any jurisdiction (and the parties

                            AGREEMENT FOR CONSULTING
                           AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

                                  WGI GUARANTY

        This GUARANTY (this "Guaranty") is made as of January___________, 2002,
by Washington Group International, Inc, a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of Delaware, U.S.A. (the "Guarantor"), in favor of Raytheon
Engineers & Constructors International, Inc., a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of Delaware, U.S.A. ("RECI"), and Raytheon Company, a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware, U.S.A. ("Parent",
and together with RECI, "Raytheon").

                                   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, Washington Group International, Inc., a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of Ohio, U.S.A. ("Consultant") and Raytheon entered
into that certain Agreement for Consulting and Professional Services dated as of
January_______, 2002 (the "Services Agreement") whereby Consultant agreed to
provide certain services and personnel to assist Raytheon in performing its
obligations under the Support Agreements (as that term is defined in the
Services Agreement);

        WHEREAS, on May 14, 2001, Consultant and Guarantor each filed voluntary
bankruptcy petitions (the "Original Bankruptcy Filing") in the United States
Bankruptcy Court (the "Bankruptcy Court") for the District of Nevada;

        WHEREAS, Consultant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Guarantor; and

        WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Services Agreement, Guarantor
is required to unconditionally and irrevocably guaranty to Raytheon and its
designees, the due and prompt performance and payment when due of each and every
obligation, responsibility, undertaking, representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement of Consultant under the Services Agreement;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

        All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Services Agreement.

<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE II

                                    GUARANTY

        Section 2.1     Guaranty

        (a)     The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees,
as primary obligor, to Raytheon, the due and punctual payment and performance as
and when due of the obligations, responsibilities, undertakings,
representations, warranties, payment covenants, obligations and agreements of
Consultant under the Services Agreement, including, without limitation, all
damages provided for in the Services Agreement (other than damages expressly
excluded therein) payable as a result of a default thereunder by Consultant. The
Guarantor agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay
Raytheon, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Raytheon in the enforcement of any of
its rights under this Guaranty, without setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or any
other item of reduction.

        (b)     If, for any reason, Consultant shall fail duly and punctually to
pay any such sum, or perform any such obligation, as provided in the Services
Agreement, the Guarantor, subject to the terms of this Guaranty, shall (i) pay
any such sum together with interest thereon, if any, as provided in the Services
Agreement, and (ii) commence performance of such obligations as provided
therein, in each case not later than five (5) days after the date of written
notice from Raytheon, and thereafter diligently pursue completion of the same.
In the event that the Consultant rejects or otherwise abandons its obligations
under the Services Agreement, at the election of Raytheon, in its sole and
absolute discretion, Guarantor shall, in performance of its obligations under
this Guaranty, assume, and become primarily liable for all of Consultant's
obligations under, the Services Agreement.

        (c)     This Guaranty shall be binding upon and enforceable against the
Guarantor without regard to the genuineness, validity or enforceability of the
Services Agreement or any term thereof or lack of power or authority of any
party to enter into the Services Agreement or any amendments thereto, including
any assignment or termination. This Guaranty is not, and shall not in any way
be, conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect payment from or
proceed against Consultant, any security held by or for the benefit of Raytheon
in respect of Consultant or any other event or contingency.

        Section 2.2     Court Approval.

        Guarantor hereby represents and warrants, that it has obtained an order
of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing Guarantor to enter into, deliver and perform
this Guaranty and each and every obligation hereunder, including without
limitation, each and every obligation of Consultant under the Services
Agreement.

        Section 2.3     Bankruptcy or Insolvency.

        In the event that the Services Agreement shall be terminated as a result
of the rejection or disaffirmance thereof by any trustee, receiver or
liquidating agency of Consultant, or in the event of any rejection of any
properties of Consultant in any assignment for the benefit of creditors or

                                        2

<PAGE>

any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding (each, an
"Insolvency Event"), the Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to the
same extent as if the Services Agreement had not been so rejected or
disaffirmed. The Guarantor shall, and does hereby, waive all rights and benefits
which might relieve, in whole or in part, the Guarantor from the performance of
its duties and obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, and the
Guarantor agrees that it shall be liable for all sums, including all damages
owed by Consultant under the Services Agreement, and all obligations guaranteed
by this Guaranty irrespective of, and without regard to, any modification,
limitation or discharge of the liability of Consultant that may result from any
such proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AGREEMENTS

        Section 3.1     Obligations of Guarantor Absolute, etc.

        (a)     The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be primary,
original, absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable, and shall not be
subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction, abatement or defense based upon
any claim the Guarantor may have against Consultant.

        (b)     The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be waived,
modified or deemed to be excused or satisfied as the result of Guarantor's
inability to perform its obligations hereunder due to any physical or legal
impediments whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be waived, modified, or deemed
excused or satisfied, other than to the extent that Consultant's corresponding
obligations are waived, modified, or deemed excused or satisfied, as the result
of (i) force majeures, acts of god, or claims of impossibility or
impracticality, (ii) the inability of Guarantor to obtain or maintain any
necessary permits, licenses or qualifications, or (iii) the existence of any
applicable law, ruling, judgment, decree or order which would otherwise prohibit
or prevent Guarantor from performing its obligations hereunder. In the event
that Guarantor does not perform any or all of its obligations under this
Guaranty (and the Services Agreement), the Guarantor shall indemnify Raytheon
for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from
or in connection with such non-performance.

        (c)     The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in
any way impaired or affected by, any circumstance or condition (whether or not
the Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including but not
limited to:

                (i)     any amendment or modification of or supplement to the
Services Agreement or any part thereof, or any assignment of transfer of any
part thereof, or any furnishing or acceptance of additional security, or any
release of any security or any failure or inability to perfect any security;

                (ii)    any failure on the part of Consultant to perform or
comply with any term of the Services Agreement;

                                        3

<PAGE>

                (iii)   the occurrence or continuance of any default by
Consultant under the Services Agreement;

                (iv)    any waiver, consent, change, extension, indulgence,
release or other action or inaction under or in respect of the Services
Agreement or any exercise or nonexercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege under or in respect thereof;

                (v)     any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to
Consultant, any affiliate thereof, or any of its respective properties or
creditors, or any action taken by any court, trustee, receiver or liquidating
agent in any such proceeding, including, without limitation, any termination or
