issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the

Registrable Securities. Such registered shares of Common Stock shall be
allocated among the Holders pro rata based on the total number of Registrable
Securities issued or issuable as of each date that a Registration Statement, as
amended, relating to the resale of the Registrable Securities is declared
effective by the Commission. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the
contrary, if the actual number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon

          On or prior to the Filing Date the Company shall prepare and file with
the Commission a "shelf" Registration Statement covering all Registrable
Securities for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule
415. The Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Company is
not then eligible to register for resale the Registrable

                                       -3-
<Page>

Securities on Form S-3, in which case such registration shall be on another
appropriate form in accordance herewith). Except as set forth on SCHEDULE II,
the Company shall (i) not permit any securities other than the Registrable
Securities to be included in the Registration Statement and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the
filing thereof, but in any event prior to the Effectiveness Date, and to keep
such Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act
until such date as is the earlier of (x) the date when all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold or (y) the date
on which the Registrable Securities may be sold without any restriction pursuant
to Rule 144 as determined by the counsel to the Company pursuant to a written
opinion letter, addressed to the Company's transfer agent to such effect (the
"EFFECTIVENESS PERIOD"). If at any time and for any reason, an additional
Registration Statement is required to be filed because at such time the actual
number of shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred Stock is convertible
and the Warrants are exercisable exceeds the number of shares of Registrable
Securities remaining under the Registration Statement, the Company shall have
twenty (20) Business Days to file such additional Registration Statement, and
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such
additional Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as
soon as possible, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after filing.

     3.   REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

          In connection with the Company's registration obligations hereunder,
the Company shall:

          (a)  Prepare and file with the Commission, on or prior to the Filing
Date, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or if the Company is not then
eligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 such
registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith)
including the method or methods of distribution thereof as specified by the
Holders (except if otherwise directed by the Holders) and in accordance with
applicable law, and cause the Registration Statement to become effective and
remain effective as provided herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the filing of the Registration Statement or any
related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Company shall (i)
furnish to the Holders and any Special Counsel, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such
Holders and such Special Counsel, and (ii) cause its officers and directors,
counsel and independent certified public accountants to respond to such
inquiries as shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such
Holders, to conduct a reasonable review of such documents. The Company shall not
file the Registration Statement or any such Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto to which the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities or any Special Counsel shall reasonably object in writing within
three (3) Business Days of their receipt thereof.

          (b)  (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, to the Registration Statement as may be
necessary to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective as to the
applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and
file with the Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to
register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable

                                       -4-
<Page>

Securities; (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by
any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented or amended to be
filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated
under the Securities Act; (iii) respond as promptly as possible, but in no event
later than ten (10) business days, to any comments received from the Commission
with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and as
promptly as possible provide the Holders true and complete copies of all
correspondence from and to the Commission relating to the Registration
Statement; and (iv) comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement during the
applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Holders thereof set forth in the Registration Statement as so amended or in such
Prospectus as so supplemented.

          (c)  Notify the Holders of Registrable Securities and any Special
Counsel as promptly as possible (and, in the case of (i)(A) below, not less than
three (3) days prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person)
confirm such notice in writing no later than two (2) Business Days following the
day (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement is filed; (B) when the Commission
notifies the Company whether there will be a "review" of such Registration
Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration
Statement and (C) with respect to the Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any
request by the Commission or any other Federal or state governmental authority
for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for
additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement covering any or
all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation or threatening of any
Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation of any Proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of
the occurrence of any event that makes any statement made in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that
requires any revisions to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,
as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

          (d)  Use its commercially reasonable best efforts to avoid the
issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of, as promptly as possible,
(i) any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or (ii)
any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of
the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction.

          (e)  If requested by the Holders of a majority in interest of the
Registrable Securities, (i) promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement such information as the
Company reasonably agrees should be included therein and (ii) make all required
filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective

                                       -5-
<Page>

amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received notification of
the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment.

          (f)  If requested by any Holder, furnish to such Holder and any
Special Counsel, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each
Registration Statement and each amendment thereto, including financial
statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference, and all exhibits to the extent requested by
such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated by reference)
promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission.

          (g)  Promptly deliver to each Holder and any Special Counsel, without
charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of
prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may
reasonably request; and subject to the provisions of Section 3(m), the Company
hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement
thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale
of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

          (h)  Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with
the selling Holders and any Special Counsel in connection with the registration
or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such
Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws
of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Holder requests in
writing, to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other
acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in
such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified
or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any
such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or subject the Company to any
material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.

          (i)  Cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold
pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates, to the extent
permitted by the Purchase Agreement and applicable federal and state securities
laws, shall be free of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable
Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any
Holder may request at least two (2) Business Days prior to any sale of
Registrable Securities.

          (j)  Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(c)(v),
as promptly as possible, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a
post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as
thereafter delivered, neither the Registration Statement nor such Prospectus
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required

                                       -6-
<Page>

to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (k)  Use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities relating to such Registration Statement to be listed on
The Nasdaq National Market or any other securities exchange, quotation system or
market, if any, on which similar securities issued by the Company are then
listed as and when required pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

          (l)  Comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and make generally available to its security
holders earning statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 not later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month
period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a
fiscal year) commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the
Company after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which statement
shall conform to the requirements of Rule 158.

          (m)  The Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the
Company information regarding such Holder and the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as is required by law to be disclosed in the Registration
Statement, Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and the Company
may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of any such Holder
who unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time
after receiving such request.

          Each Holder covenants and agrees that (i) it will not sell any
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until it has received
copies of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented as contemplated in
Section 3(g) and notice from the Company that such Registration Statement and
any post-effective amendments thereto have become effective as contemplated by
Section 3(c) and (ii) it and its officers, directors or Affiliates, if any, will
comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as
applicable to them in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement.

          Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Securities
that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event
of the kind described in Section 3(c)(ii), 3(c)(iii), 3(c)(iv), 3(c)(v) or 3(n),
such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement
contemplated by Section 3(j), or until it is advised in writing (the "ADVICE")
by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in
either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that
are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or
Registration Statement.

          (n)  If (i) there is material non-public information regarding the
Company which the Company's Board of Directors (the "BOARD") reasonably
determines not to be in the Company's best interest to disclose and which the
Company is not otherwise required to disclose, or (ii) there is a significant
business opportunity (including, but not limited to, the acquisition or
disposition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business) or any
merger, consolidation,

                                       -7-
<Page>

tender offer or other similar transaction) available to the Company which the
Board reasonably determines not to be in the Company's best interest to
disclose, then the Company may postpone or suspend filing or effectiveness of a
registration statement for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive days, provided
that the Company may not postpone or suspend its obligation under this Section
3(n) for more than 45 days in the aggregate during any 12 month period;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such postponement or suspension shall be permitted
for consecutive 20 day periods, arising out of the same set of facts,
circumstances or transactions.

     4.   REGISTRATION EXPENSES.

          All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance
with this Agreement by the Company, except as and to the extent specified in

                                       -8-
<Page>

principal as a result of a pledge or any failure to perform under a margin call
of Common Stock), investment advisors and employees of each of them, each Person
who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, agents and
employees of each such controlling Person, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, costs of preparation and
attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively, "LOSSES"), as incurred, arising out
of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any form of
prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto), in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statements or omissions arise out of or are based upon information
regarding the Holders or such other Indemnified Party furnished in writing to
the Company by a Holder expressly for use therein, which information was
reasonably relied on by the Company for use therein or to the extent that such
information relates to a Holder or such Holder's proposed method of distribution
of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by
a Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or
such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto. The Company
shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any
Proceeding of which the Company is aware in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b)  INDEMNIFICATION BY HOLDERS. Each Holder shall, severally and not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors, officers,
agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as
incurred, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or any
form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto), in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by
such Holder or other Indemnified Party to the Company expressly for use therein
and that such information was reasonably relied upon by the Company for use
therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such
Holder's proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was
reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in
the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Holders shall be liable under this Section 5(b) for only
that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds to such Holder as a result of
the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

                                       -9-
<Page>

          (c)  CONDUCT OF INDEMNIFICATION PROCEEDINGS. If any Proceeding shall
be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the Person
from whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY) in writing, and the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, including
the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense
thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities
pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have
proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

          An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party
or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to
assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named
parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such parties shall have
been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the
same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
(in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending
or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party
and indemnity has been sought hereunder, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

          All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable
fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or
preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this
Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten (10)
Business Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (regardless of
whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall reimburse
all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).

          (d)  CONTRIBUTION. If indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is
due but unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure or refusal of a
governmental authority to enforce such indemnification in accordance with its
terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party,
in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in

                                      -10-
<Page>

such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions,
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been
taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying,
Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or
omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c), any
reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such
party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been
indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in
this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms.

          The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section
are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the law.

     6.   RULE 144.

          As long as any Holder owns Shares, Conversion Shares, Warrants or
Warrant Shares, the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As long as any Holder owns Shares,
Conversion Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares, if the Company is not required to
file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, it will
prepare and furnish to the Holders and make publicly available in accordance
with Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act annual and quarterly
financial statements, together with a discussion and analysis of such financial
statements in form and substance substantially similar to those that would
otherwise be required to be included in reports required by Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as any other information required thereby, in
the time period that such filings would have been required to have been made
under the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it will take such
further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required
from time to time to enable such Person to sell Conversion Shares and Warrant
Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act,
including providing any legal opinions relating to such sale pursuant to Rule
144. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to

                                      -11-
<Page>

such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether
it has complied with such requirements.

     7.   MISCELLANEOUS.

          (a)  REMEDIES. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder,
of any of their obligations under this Agreement, such Holder or the Company, as
the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by
law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and each
Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for
any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for
specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

          (b)  NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has, as of the date hereof entered into and currently in effect,
nor shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on or after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or
otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE
2.1(c) of the Purchase Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has previously entered into any agreement currently in effect
granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities to any
Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the written
consent of the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding Registrable
Securities, the Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the
Company to register any securities of the Company under the Securities Act
unless the rights so granted are subject in all respects to the prior rights in
full of the Holders set forth herein, and are not otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of this Agreement.

          (c)  NO PIGGYBACK ON REGISTRATIONS. Neither the Company nor any of its
security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto or as
disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.1(c) of the Purchase Agreement) may include securities
of the Company in the Registration Statement, and the Company shall not after
the date hereof enter into any agreement providing such right to any of its
securityholders, unless the right so granted is subject in all respects to the
prior rights in full of the Holders set forth herein, and is not otherwise in
conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

          (d)  PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATIONS. If at any time when there is not an
effective Registration Statement covering (i) Conversion Shares or (ii) Warrant
Shares, the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a
registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the
account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities,
other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities
Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely
in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity
securities issuable in connection with stock option or other employee benefit
plans, or as set forth on Schedule 7(d), the Company shall send to each holder
of Registrable Securities written notice of such determination and, if within
thirty (30)

                                      -12-
<Page>

days after receipt of such notice, or within such shorter period of time as may
be specified by the Company in such written notice as may be necessary for the
Company to comply with its obligations with respect to the timing of the filing
of such registration statement, any such holder shall so request in writing,
(which request shall specify the Registrable Securities intended to be disposed
of by the Purchasers), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities
which the Company has been so requested to register by the holder, to the extent
requisite to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities so to be
registered, provided that if at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company
shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such
securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to such holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination
not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to
pay expenses in accordance with Section 4 hereof), and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any
Registrable Securities being registered pursuant to this Section 7(d) for the
same period as the delay in registering such other securities. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to include in such registration
statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such holder requests to
be registered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be required to
register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 7(d) that are
eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act. In the case of
an underwritten public offering, if the managing underwriter(s) or
underwriter(s) should reasonably object to the inclusion of the Registrable
Securities in such registration statement, then if the Company after
consultation with the managing underwriter should reasonably determine that the
inclusion of such Registrable Securities would materially adversely affect the
offering contemplated in such registration statement, and based on such
determination recommends inclusion in such registration statement of fewer or
none of the Registrable Securities of the Holders, then (x) the number of
Registrable Securities of the Holders included in such registration statement
shall be reduced pro-rata among such Holders (based upon the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration), if the
Company after consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of
fewer Registrable Securities, or (y) none of the Registrable Securities of the
Holders shall be included in such registration statement, if the Company after
consultation with the underwriter(s) recommends the inclusion of none of such
Registrable Securities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Securities are being offered
for the account of other persons or entities as well as the Company, such
reduction shall not represent a greater fraction of the number of Registrable
securities intended to be offered by the Holders than the fraction of similar
reductions imposed on such other persons or entities (other than the Company).

          (e)  FAILURE TO FILE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND OTHER EVENTS. The
Company and the Purchasers agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the
Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date and not
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and
maintained in the manner contemplated herein during the Effectiveness Time. The
Company and the Holders further agree that it would not be feasible to ascertain
the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, if, except as set forth
in Section 3(n), (A) the Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the
Filing Date, or (B) the

                                      -13-
<Page>

Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior
to the 120th day after the Closing Date (or in the event an additional
Registration Statement is filed because the actual number of shares of Common
Stock into which the Preferred Stock is convertible and the Warrants are
exercisable exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock initially registered is
not filed and declared effective with the time periods set forth in Section 2),
or (C) the Company fails to file with the Commission a request for acceleration
in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated under the Securities Act within five (5)
Business Days of the date that the Company is notified (orally or in writing,
whichever is earlier) by the Commission that a Registration Statement will not
be "reviewed," or is not subject to further review, or (D) the Registration
Statement is filed with and declared effective by the Commission but thereafter
ceases to be effective as to all Registrable Securities at any time prior to the
expiration of the Effectiveness Period, without being succeeded immediately by a
subsequent Registration Statement filed with and declared effective by the
Commission in accordance with Section 2 hereof or (E) the Company has breached
Section 3(n), or (F) trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended or if the
Common Stock is delisted from The Nasdaq National Market for any reason for more
than three Business Days in the aggregate without subsequent listing on another
securities exchange, quotation system or market (any such failure or breach
being referred to as an "EVENT," and for purposes of clauses (A) and (B) the
date on which such Event occurs, or for purposes of clause (C) the date on which
such five Business Day period is exceeded, or for purposes of clause (D) after
more than fifteen Business Days, or for purposes of clause (F) the date on which
such three Business Day period is exceeded, being referred to as "EVENT DATE"),
the Company shall pay an amount as liquidated damages to each Holder equal to 3%
for the first calendar month or portion thereof and 1.5% per calendar month
thereafter or portion thereof of the Holder's initial investment in the
Preferred Stock from the Event Date, less any amount of Preferred Stock that has
been converted or redeemed by such Holder (provided that, with respect to the
Event described in clause (B), the "first calendar month" shall be deemed to
commence on the 30th day prior to the Event Date), until the applicable Event is
cured; PROVIDED, THAT, liquidated damages for the first calendar month upon the
occurrence of an Event shall be payable in cash only, and for each calendar
month thereafter shall be payable at the Company's option in cash or shares of
Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (e), if
(I) any of the Events described in clauses (A), (B) or (C) shall have occurred,
(II) on or prior to the applicable Event Date, the Company shall have exercised
its rights under Section 3(n) hereof and (III) the postponement or suspension
permitted pursuant to such Section 3(n) shall remain effective as of such
applicable Event Date, then the applicable Event Date shall be deemed instead to
occur on the second Business Day following the termination of such postponement
or suspension. If the Company elects to pay in shares of Common Stock, the
number of such shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Holders pursuant to
this paragraph (e) shall be based on the liquidated damage amount divided by the
average of the closing bid and asked price of the Common Stock for the five
trading days prior to such Event Date and shall be issuable promptly upon
receipt by the Company of a written demand from a Holder made on or after the
Event Date.

          (f)  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company
and each of the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to
depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates

                                      -14-
<Page>

exclusively to the rights of Holders and that does not directly or indirectly
affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a
majority of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended,
modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence.

          (g)  NOTICES. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing

transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the
facsimile telephone number specified for notice prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on a Business Day, (ii) the Business Day after the date of

City time, on any date and earlier than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on such
date, (iii) the Business Day following the date of mailing, if sent by overnight
delivery by nationally recognized overnight courier service or (iv) actual
receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be given. The addresses

Company, addressed to:

          (h)  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns
and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder and its successors and assigns.
The Company may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Holder. Each Purchaser may
assign its rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as permitted under
the Purchase Agreement.

          (i)  ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The rights of each Holder
hereunder, including the right to have the Company register for resale
Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be
automatically assignable by each Holder to any Affiliate of such Holder or any
other Holder or Affiliate of any other Holder of all or a portion of the
Preferred Stock or the Registrable Securities if: (i) the Holder agrees in
writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of
such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such
assignment, (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or
assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the name

                                      -15-
<Page>

and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the securities with respect
to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, (iii)
following such transfer or assignment the further disposition of such securities
by the transferee or assignees is restricted under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, (iv) at or before the time the Company
receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section, the
transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of
the provisions of this Agreement, (v) such transfer shall have been made in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Purchase Agreement, and (vi)
at least 250,000 shares of Registrable Securities (appropriately adjusted for
any stock dividend, split or combination of the Common Stock) are being
transferred to such transferee or assignee in connection with such assignment of
rights. In addition, each Holder shall have the right to assign its rights
hereunder to any other Person with the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights to assignment shall
apply to the Holders (and to subsequent) successors and assigns.

          (j)  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. In
the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, such
signature shall create a valid binding obligation of the party executing (or on
whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with the same force and effect
as if such facsimile signature were the original thereof.

          (k)  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

          (l)  CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. The remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          (m)  SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable in any
respect, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set
forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their
reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same
or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision,
covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the
intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be
hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

          (n)  HEADINGS. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect
any of the provisions hereof.

          (o)  SHARES HELD BY THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES. Whenever the
consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Registrable
Securities is required hereunder, Registrable Securities held by the Company or
its Affiliates (other than any Holder or transferees or successors or assigns
thereof if such Holder is deemed to be an Affiliate solely by reason of its

                                      -16-
<Page>

holdings of such Registrable Securities) shall not be counted in determining
whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required
percentage.
