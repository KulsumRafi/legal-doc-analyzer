                                                                  EXECUTION COPY


                              SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

         This Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of July
26, 2002, by and among The Williams Companies Inc. ("TWC", and, collectively
with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "TWC Entities"); Williams
Communications Group, Inc. ("WCG" and, collectively with its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, the "Company" or the "WCG Entities") and CG Austria, Inc. ("CG
Austria") each as a debtor and debtor in possession in cases commenced (the
"Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court") the official committee of
unsecured creditors (the "Committee") appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases; and
Leucadia National Corporation ("Leucadia") (collectively, the "Parties").

         WHEREAS, WCG was initially incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TWC;

         WHEREAS, in September 1999, WCG raised approximately $1.5 billion
through an initial public offering and certain private placements of WCG stock;

         WHEREAS, on April 23, 2001, TWC distributed to its shareholders
substantially all of its remaining WCG stock pursuant to a tax-free spin-off
(the "Spin-Off");

         WHEREAS, prior to the Spin-Off, WCG (i) issued certain unsecured senior
redeemable notes in the aggregate amount of $3 billion (the "Senior Redeemable
Notes"), approximately $2.45 billion of which is currently publicly held and
$550 million of which was acquired (and is currently held) by an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of WCG in September and October of 2001; (ii) guaranteed
the obligations of WCG's wholly-owned operating subsidiary and principal asset,
Williams Communications, LLC ("WCL"), under an Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated as of September 8, 1999 (as subsequently amended and restated,
the "WCL Credit Agreement") (iii) issued a promissory note in the amount of $1.5
billion (the "Senior Reset Note") which was pledged to secure payment of $1.4
billion of notes that were issued by subsidiaries of WCG and guaranteed by TWC;
(iv) incurred obligations of approximately $120 million for various
administrative services that were provided by the TWC Entities prior to the
Spin-Off (the "Pre-Spin Services Claim") and (v) agreed to reimburse TWC for all
amounts paid by TWC in respect of WCL's $750 million lease of a portion of the
Company's fiber optic network (the "ADP Claim")

         WHEREAS, in September 2001, following the Spin-Off, TWC provided
additional financing to the Company in the form of a sale/leaseback transaction
(the "Sale/Leaseback") pursuant to which the Company (i) sold to TWC its
headquarters building (the "Headquarters Building"), related real estate, and
certain ancillary assets for approximately $276 million in cash, and (ii) agreed
to lease that property back from TWC for periods ranging from three to ten
years;

         WHEREAS, in the fourth quarter of 2001 and early 2002, as the financial
markets in general and the telecom market in particular experienced significant
deterioration, the Company began discussing a restructuring of its balance sheet
with the lenders (the "Lenders") under the WCL Credit Agreement with the goal of
reducing the overall leverage of the Company in order to enhance its financial
flexibility;

         WHEREAS, in late February, 2002, certain holders of the Senior
Redeemable Notes formed an informal committee ( the "Ad Hoc Committee"),
retained legal and financial advisors, and began negotiating with WCG for a
comprehensive restructuring of WCG's balance sheet. In addition, the Ad



<PAGE>

Hoc Committee's advisors commenced legal and financial diligence with respect to
both the Spin-Off and all other relationships and transactions between TWC and
the Company;

         WHEREAS, the Ad Hoc Committee had informed the Company that it was
essential that a chapter 11 case be commenced within one year of the Spin-Off in
order to preserve all defenses and claims with respect to the Spin-Off and the
claims that TWC was asserting against the Company;

         WHEREAS, the Lenders had asserted their right to set-off their debt
against WCG and WCL and such set-off against the Company's existing cash would
have threatened the future viability of the Company;

         WHEREAS, certain members of the Ad Hoc Committee had prepared an
involuntary chapter 11 filing against the Company in order to prevent the
asserted set-off;

         WHEREAS, all parties worked to negotiate the Restructuring Agreement in
order to prevent a set-off followed by extensive litigation or in the
alternative, an uncontrolled voluntary or involuntary chapter 11 case;

         WHEREAS, it was not until 8:30 p.m. (EDT) on April 22, 2002 that the
Restructuring Agreement was finalized and signed by sufficient parties for it to
become effective thus averting both the threatened set-off and the involuntary
bankruptcy filing and facilitating the voluntary chapter 11 process for WCG only
obviating the necessity for a much more complex WCL bankruptcy case;

         WHEREAS, following extensive negotiations among WCG, the Ad Hoc
Committee, and. the Lenders, those parties entered into a certain agreement
dated as of April 19, 2002 (the "Restructuring Agreement"), pursuant to which
the members of the Ad Hoc Committee and over 90% of the Lenders agreed to
support a chapter 11 plan for WCG that provided for (i) the conversion of all of
WCG's unsecured debt into the common stock of a reorganized WCG ("New WCG");
(ii) the prepayment of $450 million under the WCL Credit Agreement ($200 million
of which was paid upon execution of the Restructuring Agreement, $50 million of
which was paid on July 15, 2002, and $200 million of which must be paid as a
condition to consummation of WCG's chapter 11 plan) so that the Company's
obligations to the Lenders will be reduced to $525 million upon the completion
of the restructuring process; (iii) the continued operation of WCL outside of
bankruptcy, to minimize any negative impact of the Company's balance sheet
restructuring on WCL's customers, vendors, suppliers, employees, or the
communities in which WCL does business;

         WHEREAS, the Restructuring Agreement requires, among other things, that
(i) WCG obtain $150 million in new capital (the "New Investment") to supplement
the Company's cash resources upon emergence from chapter Il, and (ii) the
Debtors have consummated their chapter 11 plan by October 15, 2002;

         WHEREAS, on April 22, 2002, the Debtors commenced these chapter 11
cases for the purposes of restructuring their financial affairs on terms
consistent with the Restructuring Agreement;

         WHEREAS, as of the petition date, the Company's (i) secured
indebtedness consisted of approximately $775 million owed to the Lenders under
the WCL Credit Agreement and (ii) funded unsecured indebtedness owed to third
parties totaled approximately $5.5 billion, including (a) approximately $2.45
billion account of the Senior Redeemable Notes; (b) $1.5 billion owed under the
Senior Reset Note; (c) approximately $750 million owed with respect to the ADP
Claim; (d) approximately $120 million owed with respect to the Pre-Spin Services
Claim; (e) various unliquidated obligations owed to TWC arising from certain
post-Spin-Off arrangements between the Company and TWC; and (1) approximately
$275 million owed to TWC under the Sale/Leaseback;



<PAGE>

         WHEREAS on May 1, 2002, the Committee was appointed (and was comprised
of a majority of members who were former members of the Ad Hoc Committee) and
retained the same legal and financial advisors as had been utilized by the Ad
Hoc Committee;

         WHEREAS, TWC, on behalf of all of the TWC Entities, has asserted
various rights and claims against the Company, including, without limitation,
(i) not less than $2.3 billion in obligations owed by WCG as a consequence of
certain guarantees, services provided, and other financial accommodations,
including the Senior Reset Note, the ADP Claim, and Pre-Spin Services Claim; and
(ii) the right to act on defaults under the Sale/Leaseback that entitle TWC to
evict the Company from the Headquarters Building and repossess those premises
and other assets subject to the Sale/Leaseback

         WHEREAS, the Committee has asserted that the Company and its creditors
may have various claims against TWC, and rights, remedies, defenses, and offsets
with respect to the claims asserted by TWC, which, if successful, could result
in a recovery against TWC or the reduction, disallowance, subordination,
recharacterization, or elimination of some or all of TWC's claims;

         WHEREAS, the litigation of the disputes between and among the Company,
TWC, and the Committee would be complex and expensive and could delay or
otherwise impair the Debtors' ability to emerge from chapter 11 in a timely
fashion;

         WHEREAS, Leucadia is willing to provide $150 million in new equity
capital to satisfy the requirement that the New Investment be obtained and, as
more fully set forth in the Leucadia Claims Purchase Agreement (as such term is
hereinafter defined), to purchase certain of TWC's claims for a cash payment of
$180 million to TWC, so that upon WCG's emergence from chapter 11, (i) TWC will
forego the distribution of the stock of New WCG (the "New WCG Common Stock") to
which TWC otherwise would be entitled on account of its claims against WCG, and
will release all claims and causes of action against the WCG Entities and the
WCG Indemnitees (as such term is hereinafter defined), except those arising
under the Plan and this Agreement; (ii) Leucadia will own 45% of the New Common
Stock; and (iii) WCG's unsecured creditors (other than TWC) will own the
remaining 55% of the New Common Stock (with Leucadia and the unsecured
creditors' ownership shares subject to dilution from the issuance of additional
shares of up to 2% of the New WCG Common Stock to support a portion of a
channeling injunction contained in the Plan (as such term is hereinafter
defined));

         WHEREAS, Leucadia's willingness to make the New Investment and purchase
the TWC claims is conditioned on (i) the Parties' entry into, and the Bankruptcy
Court's approval of, this Agreement, which provides for the settlement of all
disputes between the Company, the Committee, and the TWC Entities, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein and in the related agreements annexed hereto and
made a part hereof; (ii) the implementation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the repurchase of the Headquarters Building and related assets
for $50 million in cash and a $100 million mortgage) and (iii) the confirmation
and consummation of the Plan, including the entry of a channeling injunction as
set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, the Parties wish to settle and compromise the disputes and
issues between and among them on the terms set forth herein in order to avoid
the expense, delay, uncertainty, and risks of litigation, and to enable the New
Investment to be consummated so that the Debtors can emerge successfully from
chapter 11;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby consent and
agree as follows:

                        offset, reduction, objection, subordination,
                        recharacterization, or any other Cause of Action that
                        would reduce, delay, or impede any right of the holder

                        Plan Effective Date;

                        in interest, or any assets or property of such
                        transferee or successor; and

                  (v)   proceeding in any manner that does not conform or comply
                        with the provisions of the Plan (including the
                        Securities Holder Channeling Fund Distribution
                        Procedures), the Approval Order or this Agreement.

                  5. The Settlement Motion: the Plan; TWC Approval Rights.
Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, (a)
the Debtors and the Committee shall (i) file with the Bankruptcy Court a joint
motion seeking entry of the Approval Order, and (ii) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the Approval Order, and (b) the Debtors,
the Committee, and Leucadia shall (i) file with the Bankruptcy Court the Plan,
and (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to confirm and consummate the
Plan. From and upon the execution of this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of TWC (a) the Plan may not be modified or amended (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 8.3 and 8.13 of the Plan), and (b) the
conditions to confirmation of the Plan and the occurrence of the Plan Effective
Date (including, without limitation, those conditions set forth in Article IV of
the Plan) may not be waived.

<PAGE>
                  6. Committee Encouragement Efforts. The Committee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to encourage holders of Claims in Classes 5 and
6 under the Plan to (a) support the Plan; (b) support, and not oppose, entry by
the Bankruptcy Court of the Approval Order; and (c) subject to the Bankruptcy
Court's entry of an order approving a disclosure statement with respect to the
Plan as containing "adequate information" as required by section 1125 of the
Bankruptcy Code, vote to accept the Plan.

                  7. Non-Interference. The Committee, Leucadia, and TWC shall
not (a) take any action that would delay entry of the Approval Order or the
confirmation and consummation of the Plan; (b) solicitor encourage offers or
proposals, or entertain or engage in discussions with respect to any unsolicited
offer or proposal, or enter into any agreements, arrangements, or understandings
relating to any other chapter 11 plan with respect to WCG or enter into any
transaction involving the WCG Entities or their assets that would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with this Agreement, the Plan, or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (c) consent to, support, or participate in any formulation
of a chapter 11 plan for WCG other than the Plan; (d) encourage or support in
any fashion any person to (i) object to the entry of the Approval Order, or (ii)
vote against or object to the Plan; or (e) take any action directly or
indirectly for the purpose of delaying, preventing, frustrating, or impeding
entry of the Approval Order, or acceptance, confirmation, and consummation of
the Plan; provided, however, nothing herein shall prevent the Committee from
taking such actions as it determines in good faith to be necessary under
applicable law to fulfill its fiduciary duties in the event it receives a Notice
Concerning Negotiations; provided further, that nothing herein shall prevent the
Committee from informing itself in connection with the good faith exercise of
its fiduciary duties. Leucadia and the Company each agrees to promptly give
written notice to the Committee with a copy to TWC (with such notice being
herein referred to as a "Notice Concerning Negotiations", and with the giving of
such notice being deemed not to be a breach of the Settlement Agreement or any
related agreement) in the event that, in its good faith judgment (i) the
negotiations with the Lenders to obtain their consents in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement and the Plan are unlikely
to be successful or (ii) neither the negotiations with SBC to obtain its
consent, nor the efforts to obtain a court order providing that SBC does not
have the right to terminate its agreements with the Company, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement and the Plan is likely
to be successful.

                  8. TWC to Accept the Plan. Subject to the Bankruptcy Court's
entry of an order approving a disclosure statement with respect to the Plan as
containing "adequate information" as required by section 1125 of the Bankruptcy
Code, TWC shall vote the TWC Assigned Claims to accept the Plan.

                  9. Authority. Subject only to such approval of the Bankruptcy
Court as is required with respect to the Debtors entry herein, each signatory to
this Agreement warrants that it has the authority to execute this Agreement on
behalf of the Party noted; provided, however, that the Parties hereto
acknowledge that (a) the Company has not obtained such waivers or consents, if
any, that may be required under the WCL Credit Agreement to implement the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (b) none of the Parties hereto
(including the Debtors) will assert or use this Agreement or its approval by the
Bankruptcy Court as waiving or otherwise annulling or satisfying any requirement
under the WCL Credit Agreement that such waivers or consents as are required to
implement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be obtained.

                  10. Binding Effect Subject only to approval of the Bankruptcy
Court with respect to the Debtors' obligations under Section 1, the provisions
of this Agreement are binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement and to each Party's respective successors and assigns.

                  11. Fiduciary Duties. Based on the facts and circumstances
known to WCG and the




<PAGE>

Committee as of the date hereof, WCG and the Committee acknowledge that their
entry into this Agreement and the consummation of the compromises and
settlements contemplated hereby are within the exercise of their respective
fiduciary duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement,
including in Sections 6 or 7 or in the preceding sentence, shall impair or
prevent the Debtors or the Committee from exercising their fiduciary duties and
taking such steps as each may determine in good faith to be necessary under
applicable law to fulfill such duties. Without limiting by implication the
generality of the forgoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Committee has
retained conflicts counsel to advise it with regard to certain issues, and that
the acknowledgment by the Committee in the next preceding sentence is qualified
to the extent of any contrary advice of such counsel with respect to such issues
and that the agreements of the Committee in Sections 6 and 7 of this Agreement
are subject to any actions which the Committee determines in good faith to be
necessary under applicable law to fulfill its fiduciary duties based on the
advice of such counsel with respect to such issues.

                  12. Governing Law: Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts
of laws principles. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) submits and consents in
advance to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court for the purpose of
any action or proceeding in which any WCG Entity is a party arising out of or
relating to this Agreement; (b) agrees that all claims in respect to such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court; and (c)
waives any objection that such Party may have based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens. To the extent that any
action or proceeding among the Parties, other than a WCG Entity, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement is commenced, those Parties (and not the WCG
Entities) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof.

                  13. Entire Agreement This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, and
the applicable provisions in the Plan constitute the complete and entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the matters contained in this
Agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions
between the Parties, with respect thereto; provided, however, that nothing in
this Agreement shall (a) be deemed to have modified or superseded the TWC Plan
Support Agreement and the Restructuring Agreement; or (b) be a waiver or release
of any Party from any disclosure or other obligation or restriction regarding
the sale, purchase, assignment, or other trading in claims against any of the
WCG Entities, which must be the subject of a separate agreement and otherwise
conform to any orders that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court.

                  14. Non-Reliance. Each of the Parties acknowledges that, in
entering into this Agreement, it is not relying upon any representations or
warranties made by anyone other than those terms and provisions expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, and the applicable provisions in
the Plan.

                  15. Amendment. It is expressly understood and agreed that this
Agreement may not be altered, amended, waived, modified or otherwise changed in
any respect or particular whatsoever except by a writing duly executed by
authorized representatives of each of the Parties, and the Parties further
acknowledge and agree that they will make no claim at any time or place that
this Agreement has been orally supplemented, modified, or altered in any respect
whatsoever.

                  16. No Admissions. This Agreement shall in no event be
construed as or be deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession on the
part of the TWC Entities, the WCG Entities, or the WCG Indemnitees of any claim
or any fault or liability or damages whatsoever. Each of them denies any and all
wrongdoing or liability of any kind, and does not concede any infirmity in the
claims or defenses which it has asserted or would assert.



<PAGE>

                  17. Termination. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof (and of the Approval Order), including, without limitation, the allowance
of the TWC Assigned Claims, shall terminate

              (a) automatically if the Plan Effective Date has not occurred on
                  or before February 28, 2003; or

              (b) by written notice of any Party to this Agreement to the other
                  Parties (i) if the Plan is withdrawn pursuant to Section 8.4
                  of the Plan; (ii) if confirmation of the Plan is denied by
                  Final Order, or (iii) if either of the Leucadia Investment
                  Agreement or the Leucadia Claims Purchase Agreement is
                  terminated by its terms.

Upon such termination, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,
nothing in this Agreement shall survive, and all matters, rights, and Causes of
Action between and among the Parties shall be restored as if they had not
negotiated and entered into this Agreement, it being understood that nothing in
this Section 17 is intended to nor shall it (i) alter the rights of the Parties
accruing under other agreements, including but not limited to the Leucadia
Investment Agreement and the Leucadia Claims Purchase Agreement (irrespective of
whether any such other agreements have also been terminated according to their
terms), or (ii) relieve any Party for any breach of this Agreement.
