(iv)&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph 5(C)(v), all determinations
required to be made under this Subparagraph 5(C)(iv), including whether a
Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be
made by IBC&#146;s independent auditors or any nationally recognized accounting firm
selected by IBC (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;), which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations both to IBC and Executive within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business
days of the Date of Termination, if applicable, or at such earlier time as is
reasonably requested by IBC or Executive. For purposes of determining the
amount of the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation applicable to
individuals for the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made,
and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of individual
taxation in the state and locality of Executive&#146;s residence on the Date of
Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could
be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. The initial Gross-Up
Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Subparagraph 5(C)(iv), shall be
paid to Executive within five (5)&nbsp;days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s
determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable
by Executive, the Accounting Firm shall be required to (A)&nbsp;conclude that either
(i)&nbsp;there has not occurred a change in the ownership or effective control of
IBC or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of IBC
(as such terms are defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code) or (ii)&nbsp;no portion of
the Severance Payments constitutes &#147;parachute payments&#148; (within the meaning of
said Section&nbsp;280G), in either case on the basis of &#147;substantial authority&#148;
(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. &#167; 1.6661-3), and (B)&nbsp;provide an opinion to
that effect to both IBC and Executive, including the reasons therefor and an
opinion that Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax
on his federal tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding upon IBC and Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up
Payments which will not have been made should have been made (an
&#147;Underpayment&#148;). In the event that IBC exhausts its remedies pursuant to
Subparagraph 5(C)(v) and Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of
any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the
Underpayment that has occurred, consistent with the calculations required to be
made hereunder, and any such Underpayment, and any interest and penalties
imposed on the Underpayment and required to be paid by Executive in connection
with the proceedings described in Subparagraph 5(C)(v), shall be promptly paid
by IBC to or for the benefit of Executive.
