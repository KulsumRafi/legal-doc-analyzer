extensions of credit to be made to or for the benefit of PEI by Lenders;

            WHEREAS, pursuant to a Master Corporate Guaranty of even date

time, the "Guaranty") among each Grantor, various affiliates of PEI and Grantee,
each Grantor has guaranteed the payment of all obligations of and amounts owing

whether now owned or hereafter created, acquired or arising:

            (i) any copyrights, copyright registrations and copyright

      payable with respect thereto, including, without limitation, damages and

            (iii) licenses of any of the foregoing to or from third parties and
