Loan Requests.</I></B><I></I> To obtain a Loan, Borrower shall make a request to Silicon
by facsimile or telephone. Loan requests received after 12:00 Noon (California time) will
not be considered by Silicon until the next Business Day. Silicon may rely on any
telephone request for a Loan given by a person whom Silicon believes is an authorized
representative of Borrower, and Borrower will indemnify Silicon for any loss Silicon
suffers as a result of that reliance. </FONT></P>

Letters of Credit.</I></B><I></I> At the request of Borrower, Silicon may, in its sole
discretion, issue or arrange for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of
Borrower, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Silicon in its sole
discretion (collectively, &#147;Letters of Credit&#148;). The Borrower agrees that the
aggregate face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit from time to time shall never
exceed the lesser of amount defined in Section 1 of the Schedule as the &#147;Letter of
Credit Sublimit&#148; or the amount of Loans and other extensions of credit which are from
time to time available hereunder, and that the amount of outstanding Letters of Credit
shall be reserved against Loans and other extensions of credit which would otherwise be
available hereunder. If at any time or for any reason the aggregate face amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit shall exceed the foregoing limit, Borrower shall immediately
pay an amount equal to said excess to Silicon, without notice or demand. Borrower shall
pay all bank charges (including charges of Silicon) for the issuance <B>*</B> of Letters
of Credit, together with such additional fees as Silicon&#146;s letter of credit
department shall charge in connection with the issuance of the Letters of Credit. Any
payment by Silicon under or in connection with a Letter of Credit shall constitute a Loan
hereunder on the date such payment is made. Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiry
date no later than thirty days prior to the Maturity Date *<B>*</B>. Borrower hereby
agrees to indemnify, save, and hold Silicon harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or
liability, including payments made by Silicon, expenses, and reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees incurred by Silicon arising out of or in connection with any Letters of Credit.
Borrower agrees to be bound by the regulations and interpretations of the issuer of any
Letters of Credit guarantied by Silicon and opened for Borrower&#146;s account or by
Silicon&#146;s interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Silicon for
Borrower&#146;s account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Silicon shall not be
liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in
following Borrower&#146;s instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any
modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto. Borrower understands that Letters of
Credit may require Silicon to indemnify the issuing bank for certain costs or liabilities
arising out of claims by Borrower against such issuing bank. Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Silicon harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense, or liability
incurred by Silicon under any Letter of Credit as a result of Silicon&#146;s
indemnification of any such issuing bank. The provisions of this Agreement, as it pertains
to Letters of Credit, and any other present or future documents or agreements between
Borrower and Silicon relating to Letters of Credit are cumulative. </FONT></P>

property Collateral and carry such other business insurance, with insurers reasonably
acceptable to Silicon, in such form and amounts as Silicon may reasonably require and that
are customary and in accordance with standard practices for Borrower&#146;s industry and
locations, and Borrower shall provide evidence of such insurance to Silicon. All such
insurance policies shall name Silicon as an additional insured and loss payee, and shall
contain a lenders (or mortgagee) loss payee endorsement in form reasonably acceptable to
Silicon. Upon receipt of the proceeds of any such insurance, Silicon shall apply such
proceeds in reduction of the Obligations as Silicon shall determine in its good faith
business judgment, except that, provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Silicon shall release to Borrower insurance proceeds with respect to
Equipment totaling less than $100,000, which shall be utilized by Borrower for the
replacement of the Equipment with respect to which the insurance proceeds were paid.
Silicon may require reasonable assurance that the insurance proceeds so released will be
so used. If Borrower fails to provide or pay for any insurance, Silicon may, but is not
obligated to, obtain the same at Borrower&#146;s expense. Borrower shall promptly deliver
to Silicon copies of all material reports made to insurance companies. </FONT></P>

are hereby expressly waived by Borrower), may do any one or more of the following: (a)
Cease making Loans or otherwise extending credit to Borrower under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; (b) Accelerate and declare all or any part of the Obligations to be
immediately due, payable, and performable, notwithstanding any deferred or installment
payments allowed by any instrument evidencing or relating to any Obligation; (c) Take
possession of any or all of the Collateral wherever it may be found, and for that purpose
Borrower hereby authorizes Silicon without judicial process to enter onto any of
Borrower&#146;s premises without interference to search for, take possession of, keep,
store, or remove any of the Collateral, and remain on the premises or cause a custodian to
remain on the premises in exclusive control thereof, without charge for so long as Silicon
deems it necessary, in its good faith business judgment, in order to complete the
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided,
however, that should Silicon seek to take possession of any of the Collateral by court
process, Borrower hereby irrevocably waives: (i) any bond and any surety or security
relating thereto required by any statute, court rule or otherwise as an incident to such
possession; (ii) any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action
to recover possession thereof; and (iii) any requirement that Silicon retain possession
of, and not dispose of, any such Collateral until after trial or final judgment; (d)
Require Borrower to assemble any or all of the Collateral and make it available to Silicon
at places designated by Silicon which are reasonably convenient to Silicon and Borrower,
and to remove the Collateral to such locations as Silicon may deem advisable; (e) Complete
the processing, manufacturing or repair of any Collateral prior to a disposition thereof
and, for such purpose and for the purpose of removal, Silicon shall have the right to use
Borrower&#146;s premises, vehicles, hoists, lifts, cranes, and other Equipment and all
other property without charge; (f) Sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any of the
Collateral, in its condition at the time Silicon obtains possession of it or after further
manufacturing, processing or repair, at one or more public and/or private sales, in lots
or in bulk, for cash, exchange or other property, or on credit, and to adjourn any such
sale from time to time without notice other than oral announcement at the time scheduled
for sale. Silicon shall have the right to conduct such disposition on Borrower&#146;s
premises without charge, for such time or times as Silicon deems reasonable, or on
Silicon&#146;s premises, or elsewhere and the Collateral need not be located at the place
of disposition. Silicon may directly or through any affiliated company purchase or lease
any Collateral at any such public disposition, and if permissible under applicable law, at
any private disposition. Any sale or other disposition of Collateral shall not relieve
Borrower of any liability Borrower may have if any Collateral is defective as to title or

agree that a sale or other disposition (collectively, &#147;sale&#148;) of any Collateral
which complies with the following standards will conclusively be deemed to be commercially
reasonable: (i) Notice of the sale is given to Borrower at least ten days prior to the
sale, and, in the case of a public sale, notice of the sale is published at least ten days
before the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the sale is to
be conducted; (ii) Notice of the sale describes the collateral in general, non-specific
terms; (iii) The sale is conducted at a place designated by Silicon, with or without the
Collateral being present; (iv) The sale commences at any time between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00

is required; (vi) With respect to any sale of any of the Collateral, Silicon may (but is
not obligated to) direct any prospective purchaser to ascertain directly from Borrower any

grants to Silicon an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, authorizing
and permitting Silicon (acting through any of its employees, attorneys or agents) at any
time, at its option, but without obligation, with or without notice to Borrower, and at
Borrower&#146;s expense, to do any or all of the following, in Borrower&#146;s name or
otherwise, but Silicon agrees that if it exercises any right hereunder, it will do so in
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner: (a) Execute on behalf of Borrower any
documents that Silicon may, in its good faith business judgment, deem advisable in order
to perfect and maintain Silicon&#146;s security interest in the Collateral, or in order to
exercise a right of Borrower or Silicon, or in order to fully consummate all the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and all other Loan Documents; (b) Execute
on behalf of Borrower, any invoices relating to any Account, any draft against any Account
Debtor and any notice to any Account Debtor, any proof of claim in bankruptcy, any Notice
of Lien, claim of mechanic&#146;s, materialman&#146;s or other lien, or assignment or
satisfaction of mechanic&#146;s, materialman&#146;s or other lien; (c) Take control in any

name of Borrower upon any instruments, or documents, evidence of payment or Collateral
that may come into Silicon&#146;s possession; (d) Endorse all checks and other forms of
remittances received by Silicon; (e) Pay, contest or settle any lien, charge, encumbrance,
security interest and adverse claim in or to any of the Collateral, or any judgment based
thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; (f) Grant
extensions of time to pay, compromise claims and settle Accounts and <B>* </B> General
Intangibles for less than face value and execute all releases and other documents in
connection therewith; (g) Pay any sums required on account of Borrower&#146;s taxes or to
secure the release of any liens therefor, or both; (h) Settle and adjust, and give
releases of, any insurance claim that relates to any of the Collateral and obtain payment
therefor; (i) Instruct any third party having custody or control of any books or records
belonging to, or relating to, Borrower to give Silicon the same rights of access and other
rights with respect thereto as Silicon has under this Agreement; and (j) Take any action
or pay any sum required of Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and any other Loan
Documents. Any and all reasonable sums paid and any and all reasonable costs, expenses,
liabilities, obligations and attorneys&#146; fees incurred by Silicon with respect to the

demand, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the highest interest rate applicable to
any of the Obligations. In no event shall Silicon&#146;s rights under the foregoing power
of attorney or any of Silicon&#146;s other rights under this Agreement be deemed to
indicate that Silicon is in control of the business, management or properties of Borrower. </FONT></P>

or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Silicon shall

partial exercise of any other rights or remedies. The failure or delay of Silicon to
exercise any rights or remedies shall not operate as a waiver thereof, but all rights and

relating to the particular Account); (v) the Account must not be owing from an Affiliate
of Borrower; (vi) the Account must not be owing from an Account Debtor which is subject to
any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, or whose financial condition is not acceptable to
Silicon, or which, fails or goes out of a material portion of its business; (vii) the

an Account Debtor to whom Borrower is or may be liable for goods or services purchased by
Borrower, or third-party intellectual property licensed by Borrower (as licensee), from
such Account Debtor or otherwise (but, in such case, the Account will be deemed not

revenue amount shall be ineligible under this clause (xi), and (xii) the Account must have
been billed to the Account Debtor. Accounts owing from one Account Debtor will not be
deemed Eligible Accounts to the extent they exceed 25% of the total Eligible Accounts
outstanding. In addition, if more than 50% of the Accounts owing from an Account Debtor
are outstanding for a period longer than their Eligibility Period (without regard to
unapplied credits) or are otherwise not Eligible Accounts, then all Accounts owing from
that Account Debtor will be deemed ineligible for borrowing. Silicon may, from time to
time, in its good faith business judgment, revise the Minimum Eligibility Requirements,
upon written notice to Borrower. </FONT></P>

Waivers; Indemnity.</I></B><I></I> The failure of Silicon at any time or times to require
Borrower to strictly comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall not waive or diminish any right of Silicon later to demand and receive
strict compliance therewith. Any waiver of any default shall not waive or affect any other
default, whether prior or subsequent, and whether or not similar. None of the provisions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to have been waived by any
act or knowledge of Silicon or its agents or employees, but only by a specific written
waiver signed by an authorized officer of Silicon and delivered to Borrower. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower waives the benefit of all statutes of
limitations relating to any of the Obligations or this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of protest and notice of default or
dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, release, compromise, settlement, extension or
renewal of any commercial paper, instrument, account, General Intangible, document or
guaranty at any time held by Silicon on which Borrower is or may in any way be liable, and
notice of any action taken by Silicon, unless expressly required by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Silicon and its affiliates,
subsidiaries, parent, directors, officers, employees, agents, and attorneys, and to hold
them harmless from and against any and all claims, debts, liabilities, demands,
obligations, actions, causes of action, penalties, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees), of every kind, which they may sustain or incur based
upon or arising out of any of the Obligations, or any relationship or agreement between
Silicon and Borrower, or any other matter, relating to Borrower or the Obligations;
provided that, with respect to any indemnitee, this indemnity shall not extend to damages
proximately caused by the indemnitee&#146;s own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnity agreement
set forth in this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall for
all purposes continue in full force and effect. <B>*</B> </FONT></P>

reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and all filing, recording, search, title insurance,
appraisal, audit, and other reasonable costs incurred by Silicon, pursuant to, or in
connection with, or relating to this Agreement (whether or not a lawsuit is filed),
including, but not limited to, any reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs Silicon
incurs in order to do the following: prepare and negotiate this Agreement and all present
and future documents relating to this Agreement; obtain legal advice in connection with
this Agreement or Borrower; enforce, or seek to enforce, any of its rights; prosecute
actions against, or defend actions by, Account Debtors; commence, intervene in, or defend
any action or proceeding; initiate any complaint to be relieved of the automatic stay in
bankruptcy; file or prosecute any probate claim, bankruptcy claim, third-party claim, or
other claim; examine, audit, copy, and inspect any of the Collateral or any of
Borrower&#146;s books and records; protect, obtain possession of, lease, dispose of, or
otherwise enforce Silicon&#146;s security interest in, the Collateral; and otherwise
represent Silicon in any litigation relating to Borrower. In satisfying Borrower&#146;s
obligation hereunder to reimburse Silicon for attorneys fees, Borrower may, for
convenience, issue checks directly to Silicon&#146;s attorneys, Levy, Small &amp; Lallas,
but Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Levy, Small &amp; Lallas is representing only
Silicon and not Borrower in connection with this Agreement. If either Silicon or Borrower
files any lawsuit against the other predicated on a breach of this Agreement, the
prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and
attorneys&#146; fees, including (but not limited to) reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and
costs incurred in the enforcement of, execution upon or defense of any order, decree,
award or judgment. All attorneys&#146; fees and costs to which Silicon may be entitled
pursuant to this Section shall immediately become part of Borrower&#146;s Obligations,
shall be due on demand, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the highest interest
rate applicable to any of the Obligations. </FONT></P>

consent of Silicon, and any prohibited assignment shall be void. No consent by Silicon to

matter, cause or thing whatsoever, occurred, done, omitted or suffered to be done by
Silicon, its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants or attorneys, shall be

thereof, is based, and the service of a summons and complaint on an officer of Silicon, or
on any other person authorized to accept service on behalf of Silicon, within thirty (30)

time for Borrower to investigate and act upon any such claim or cause of action. The
one-year period provided herein shall not be waived, tolled, or extended except by the
written consent of Silicon in its sole discretion. This provision shall survive any

Act shall be that percent per annum resulting from multiplying the Contract Rate or the

Factor (as defined below). For purposes of this Section 2 of the Schedule, the term &#147;Conversion
Factor&#148; shall mean: (a) for any year other than a leap year (i.e., a year with 365
