<B>Plan Objectives</B>

          -    Meet the competitive need for a long-term incentive plan based on our success in building PXP's
               value

          -    Provide the ability to attract and retain capable staff with a competitive compensation
               opportunity

          -    Provide assurance to The Phoenix Companies shareholders that PXP associates are incented to
               maximize PXP's profitability

          -    Demonstrate to external constituents our commitment to the long-term success of PXP

<B>Plan Concept</B>

          -    The plan is designed to provide a long-term incentive based on the success of PXP.

          -    Option value will be based on a formula that incorporates changes in  operating income (before
               amortization of intangibles) and revenue.  Weighting for valuation purposes will be 2/3
               operating income and 1/3 revenue.

<B>Vesting</B>
          -    33 1/3% on the first three anniversaries of each grant

<B>Term</B>
          -    January 1, 2002 through March 31, 2007

<B>Valuation</B>
          -    Phantom Option valuations will be calculated and published quarterly.

<B>Cash Out</B>
          -    Vested Phantom Options may be cashed out only during the open window period from March 1 through
               March 31 each year

          -    The immediately preceding December 31 share value will be used to calculate the option value for
               the open window period
<B>Tax</B>
          -    Federal, state, local and FICA taxes (as applicable) will be withheld at the ordinary income tax
               rate when Phantom Options are cashed out
