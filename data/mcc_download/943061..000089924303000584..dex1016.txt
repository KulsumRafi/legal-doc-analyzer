             DEFINITIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE; NO ADVERSE INTERPRETATION

         1.1 Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings set forth in the Participation Agreement. The rules of
usage set forth in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement shall apply herein.
In the case of any conflict between the provisions of this Amendment and the
provisions of the Operative Agreements, the provisions of this Amendment shall
control construction of the terms; provided, however, that all of the terms and
provisions of this Amendment are in all respects subject to the provisions of
Section 12.16 of the Participation Agreement and the other usury savings
provisions set forth in the Operative Agreements.

         1.2 The amendments to the Operative Agreements as set forth in Section
2 of this Amendment shall only be effective from and after the date that all
conditions precedent set forth in Section 4 are satisfied or waived in writing
by the Majority Secured Parties; provided, however, that the Majority Secured
Parties shall not have the right or power to waive the condition precedent set
forth in Section 4(c)(iv) of this Amendment; and further provided, however, to

modifications and changes with respect to certain terms of the Operative
Agreements are implemented at the request of and as an accommodation to the
Credit Parties. Except as expressly set forth herein, the use of such
amendments, modifications and changes shall not be interpreted or construed in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights or remedies or would result in
any cost or expense to any party to any Operative Agreement other than a Credit
Party, or that would limit the responsibility of the Credit Parties under the
Operative Agreements, and the Credit Parties agree to indemnify and hold
harmless each such party from any such adverse effect, cost or expense.

             be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor) of such
             payment and the amount thereof. Each such payment shall reduce the
             Property Cost of each Property on a ratable basis based on a
             comparison of the then current individual Property Cost of each
             Property to the then current aggregate Property Cost of all
             Properties."

             ordinary course, (B) is then intending to transact business in the
             ordinary course and/or (C) previously transacted business in the
             ordinary course and (ii) to any physician, physician practice group
