         NOW, THEREFORE, this letter agreement, in accordance with Section 7.4

to the Asset Purchase Agreement regarding certain post-closing changes thereto
and hereby amends, modifies and supplements the Asset Purchase Agreement as

         (a)      The Company hereby grants to the Acquiror the option (the

                  those Encumbrances under Acquiror's senior credit facility, if
                  any, which may have attached on February 8, 2003 and which
                  Acquiror covenants it will obtain applicable releases if
                  required), all of Acquiror's right, title and interest in and
                  to all of the real estate leases and fixtures (together, the
                  "RETURNED ASSETS") located at or associated with the Acquired
                  Store located at 12042 East Main Street, Wolcott, NY 14590
                  (the "WOLCOTT STORE"). Acquiror hereby acknowledges that (i)
                  the Option will expire at the close of business on August 31,
                  2004, and (ii) it will be responsible for rent on the Wolcott
                  Store until such time as Acquiror exercises the Option.

         (b)      The Company hereby agrees that, should the Acquiror exercise
                  the Option, then as of the date of exercise of the Option, the
                  Company shall assume and agree to pay, perform, discharge, and
                  satisfy any and all of those Assumed Liabilities related to
                  the Returned Assets previously assumed by Acquiror on the
                  Closing Date, effective as of the date of the exercise of the
                  Option.
