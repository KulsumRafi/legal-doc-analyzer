executed by any Grantors party to such Government Contract in compliance with
the Assignment of Claims Act (or analogous state applicable Law), and (b) all
applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other
documents and papers the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and as may
be required by law in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval,
registration, qualification, or authorization of any Person deemed necessary or
appropriate for the effective exercise of any rights under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                               REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

         5.01 GENERAL REMEDIES. If an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise, in
addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and
in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the
Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any
other applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand,
presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby
waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and
realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell,
lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and
deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the
foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, broker's board or office of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or
elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such
prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without
assumption of any credit risk. The Administrative Agent may disclaim any
warranties of title, possession and quiet enjoyment. The Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall have the right upon any such public



                                       16
<PAGE>

sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale
or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of
any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is
hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative
Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may
acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the
exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims,
damages, or demands result solely from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in each case against whom
such claim is asserted. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of
Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and
proper if given at least ten (10) days before such sale or other disposition.

         5.02 SPECIFIC REMEDIES.

         (a) The Administrative Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect
such Grantor's Accounts, under the Administrative Agent's direction and control;
provided that, the Administrative Agent may curtail or terminate such authority
at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default.

         (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default:

                  (i) the Administrative Agent may communicate with Account
Debtors of any Account subject to a Security Interest and upon the request of
the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall notify (such notice to be in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) its Account Debtors that
such Accounts have been assigned to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable
benefit of itself and the Lenders;

                  (ii) each Grantor shall forward to the Administrative Agent,
on the last Business Day of each week, deposit slips related to all cash, money,
checks or any other similar items of payment received by the Grantor during such
week, and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, copies of such checks or
any other similar items of payment, together with a statement showing the
application of all payments on the Collateral during such week and a collection
report with regard thereto, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent;

                  (iii) whenever any Grantor shall receive any cash, money,
checks or any other similar items of payment relating to any Collateral
(including any Proceeds of any Collateral), such Grantor agrees that it will,
within one (1) Business Day of such receipt, deposit all such items of payment
into the Collateral Account or in a Deposit Account at Controlled Depositary,
until such Grantor shall deposit such cash, money, checks or any other similar
items of payment in the Collateral Account or in a Deposit Account at a
Controlled Depositary, such Grantor shall hold such cash, money, checks or any
other similar items of payment in trust for the Administrative Agent and Lenders
and as property of the Administrative Agent and Lenders, separate from the other
funds of such Grantor, and the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
transfer or direct the transfer of the balance of each Deposit Account to the
Collateral



                                       17
<PAGE>

Account. All such Collateral and Proceeds of Collateral received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent in the
Collateral Account as collateral security for all the Obligations and shall not
constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 5.04.

                  (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive
any and all cash dividends, payments or distributions made in respect of any
Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests or other Proceeds paid in
respect of any Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests, and any or all
of any Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests shall be registered in
the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative
Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (A) all voting, corporate and other
rights pertaining to such Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests at
any meeting of shareholders, partners or members of the relevant Issuers and (B)
any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other
rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Investment Property, or
Partnership/LLC Interests as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including,
without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the
Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests upon the merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in
the corporate, partnership or company structure of any Issuer or upon the
exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or
option pertaining to such Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests, and
in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the
Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests with any committee,
depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms
and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability
except to account for property actually received by it; but the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or
option and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be responsible for
any failure to do so or delay in so doing. In furtherance thereof, each Grantor
hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer with respect to any Collateral
consisting of Investment Property and Partnership/LLC Interests to (i) comply
with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing
that (A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B)
is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other
or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each
Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) except as otherwise
expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends, distributions or other payments
with respect to any Investment Property, or Partnership/LLC Interests directly
to the Administrative Agent; and

                  (v) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to (but shall
not be required to): (A) do all acts which the Administrative Agent may deem
necessary or proper to protect its Security Interest granted hereunder, provided
such acts are not inconsistent with or in violation of the terms of any of the
Credit Agreement, of the other Loan Documents or applicable Law, and (B) sell,
assign or otherwise transfer any Collateral in accordance with the Credit
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and applicable Law.

         (c) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice to the relevant Grantor of
the Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant
to Section 5.02(b), each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash
dividends, payments or other distributions made in respect of any



                                       18
<PAGE>

Investment Property and Partnership/LLC Interests, in each case paid in the
normal course of business of the relevant Issuer and consistent with past
practice, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all
voting and other corporate, company and partnership rights with respect to any
Investment Property and Partnership/LLC Interests; provided that, no vote shall
be cast or other corporate, company and partnership right exercised or other
action taken which, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, would
impair the Collateral or which would result in a Default or Event of Default
under any provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

         5.03 REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

         (a) [RESERVED.]

         (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable
to effect a public sale of any or all the Restricted Securities Collateral, by
reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or
more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be
obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own
account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may
result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public
sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The
Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the
Restricted Securities Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the
Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities
Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree
to do so.

         (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be
done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all
or any portion of the Restricted Securities Collateral valid and binding and in
compliance with any and all other applicable Laws. Each Grantor further agrees
that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 5.03 will cause
irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no adequate remedy at law in respect
of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in
this Section 5.03 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and
such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an
action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no
Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.

         5.04 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. At such intervals as may be agreed upon
by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, or, if an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative Agent's
election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of the Collateral
or any Proceeds of the Collateral in payment in whole or in part of the
Obligations (after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind
incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any
of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) in accordance with Section 9.03 of
the Credit Agreement. Any balance of such Proceeds remaining



                                       19
<PAGE>

after shall be paid over to the Borrower, on behalf of the Grantors, or to
whomsoever (if such Person is not a Grantor) may be lawfully entitled to receive
the same. Only after (i) the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other
amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section
9-610 and Section 9-615 of the UCC and (ii) the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments, shall the Administrative
Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor, or to whomever may be
lawfully entitled to receive the same (if such Person is not a Grantor).

         5.05 WAIVER, DEFICIENCY. Except to the extent prohibited under
applicable Law (including Section 9-602 of the UCC), each Grantor waives and
agrees not to assert any rights or privileges which it may acquire under
Sections 9-210, 9-607, 9-608, 9-610, 9-615, 9-620, 9-621, 9-623, 9-624, 9-625 or
9-627 of the UCC. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to
pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.

                                   ARTICLE VI.
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         6.01 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S APPOINTMENT AS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.

         (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of
such Grantor or in its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of
this Agreement, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all
documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the
purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and
right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor,
to do any or all of the following upon the occurrence and continuation of an
Event of Default:

                  (i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise,
take possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes,
acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Account
or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other
action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed
appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and
all such moneys due under any Account or with respect to any other Collateral
whenever payable;

                  (ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and
deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and
papers as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the Administrative
Agent's and the Lenders' security interest in_ such Intellectual Property and
the goodwill and General Intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or
represented thereby;



                                       20

therefor and the costs thereof,

                  (iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in this
Agreement, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or
transfer with respect to the Collateral; and

                  (v) (A) direct any party liable for any payment under any of
the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due
thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative Agent
shall direct; (B) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt
for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any
time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (C) sign and indorse any
invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse
receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other
documents in connection with any of the Collateral; (D) commence and prosecute
any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent
jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any
other right in respect of any Collateral; (E) defend any suit, action or
proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (F)
settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in
connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative
Agent may deem appropriate; (G) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along
with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright, Patent or
Trademark pertains), for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such
manner, as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and
(H) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or
otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the
Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do,
at the Administrative Agent's option and such Grantor's expense, at any time, or
from time to time, all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems
necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the
Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' Security Interests therein and to effect
the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might
do.

         (b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its
agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but
without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause
performance or compliance, with such agreement in accordance with the provisions
of Section 6.01(a).

         (c) The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection
with actions taken pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate for Base Rate
Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Administrative
Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such
Grantor to the Administrative Agent on demand.

         (d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully
do or cause to be done by virtue hereof in accordance with Section 6.01(a). All
powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with
an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the
Security Interests created hereby are released.

<PAGE>

         6.02 DUTY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent's sole duty
with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the
Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall
be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with
similar property for its own account. Neither the Administrative Agent, any
Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents
shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the
Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell
or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any
other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the
Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agent's and
the Lenders' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be accountable only for amounts that
they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither
they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         6.03 AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Grantor acknowledges that
the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement
with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or
non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request,
judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising
out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with
respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the
Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid
authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any
obligation, or entitlement to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in
accordance with Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement.

Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner
provided for in Section 11.02 of the Credit Agreement.

Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written
instrument pursuant to Section 7.01), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise
be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in
any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in
exercising on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver by the Administrative



                                       22
<PAGE>

Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall
not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent
or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently
and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

         7.04 ENFORCEMENT EXPENSES, INDEMNIFICATION.

connection with any workout, restructuring, bankruptcy or other similar
proceeding) including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent.

         (b) Each Grantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent
