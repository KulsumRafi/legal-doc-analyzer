                                       I.
                                     SUMMARY

          The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more
detailed information contained in the Plan and elsewhere in this Disclosure
Statement. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings given to such terms in the Plan.

          Conseco, Inc. ("CNC") is the top tier holding company for our two
operating businesses: insurance and finance. Our insurance business is operated
through subsidiaries owned directly and indirectly by CIHC, Incorporated
("CIHC"), an intermediate holding company that is controlled by CNC. Our finance
business is operated through Conseco Finance Corp. ("CFC"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CIHC, and its subsidiaries. We sometimes collectively refer to
CNC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "Conseco" or the
"Company."

          Our insurance subsidiaries develop, market and administer supplemental
health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance
products. Our finance business has historically provided a variety of finance
products including manufactured housing and floor plan loans, home equity
mortgages, home improvement and consumer product loans and private label credit
cards.

          On December 17, 2002 (the "Petition Date"), CNC, CIHC, CTIHC, Inc.,
Partners Health Group, Inc., CFC and Conseco Finance Servicing Corp.
(collectively, the "Debtors") filed petitions for reorganization and liquidation
under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois. CNC, CIHC, CTIHC, Inc. and Partners Health Group, Inc. are
sometimes referred to collectively as the "Reorganizing Debtors" and
individually as a "Reorganizing Debtor." CFC and Conseco Finance Servicing Corp.
are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Liquidating Debtors" and
individually as a "Liquidating Debtor."

          This Disclosure Statement is being furnished by the Debtors as
proponents of the Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan," a [court approved] summary
of which is set forth in Section VI), pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy
Code and in connection with the solicitation of votes (the "Solicitation") for
the acceptance or rejection of the Plan, as it may be amended or supplemented
from time to time in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy
Rules. You can view a copy the Plan in its entirety at www.bmccorp.net/conseco.

          This Disclosure Statement describes certain aspects of the Plan,
including the treatment of Holders of Claims against and Equity Interests in the
Debtors, and also describes certain aspects of the Company's operations, the
Company's projections and other related matters.

Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases

          Since commencing operations in 1982, CNC pursued a strategy of growth
through acquisitions. Primarily as a result of these acquisitions and the
funding requirements necessary to operate and expand the acquired businesses,
CNC amassed outstanding indebtedness of approximately $6.0 billion as of June
30, 2002. During the past two years, we undertook a series of steps designed to
reduce and extend the maturities of our parent company debt. Notwithstanding
these efforts, the Company's financial position continued to deteriorate,
principally due to our leveraged condition, losses experienced by our finance
business and losses in the value of our investment portfolio.

          As a result of these developments, on August 9, 2002, we announced
that we would seek to fundamentally restructure the Company's capital, and
announced that we had retained legal and financial advisors to assist us in
these efforts.

          Shortly after our August 9 announcement, the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") halted trading in CNC's common stock and other listed securities, and
we experienced a number of ratings downgrades with respect to our outstanding
securities. In addition, we experienced a further downgrade with respect to the
financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and have been operating
under increased scrutiny from insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled.

          In October 2002, we announced that we had engaged financial advisors
to pursue various alternatives with respect to our finance business and that
CNC's board of directors had approved a plan to sell or seek new investors for
our finance business. On December 19, 2002, CFC entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with CFN Investment Holdings LLC ("CFN"), an affiliate of Fortress
Investment Group LLC, J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC and Cerberus Capital Management,
L.P., pursuant to which CFC would, subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, sell all or substantially all of its assets in a

<PAGE>

sale pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code as part of CFC's chapter 11
proceedings. However, CFN has the right to exclude certain assets from its
purchase. In accordance with section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement, CFC is permitted and will continue to seek
alternative transactions that may provide greater value to CFC and its creditors
than the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

The Purpose of the Plan

          The purpose of the Plan is to provide the Company with a capital
structure that can be supported by cash flows from operations. To this end, the
Plan will reduce CNC's debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations by more
than $5.0 billion and its future annual interest expense and distributions on
Trust Preferred Securities by approximately $380 million. The Debtors believe
that the reorganization contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of
their creditors and equity holders. If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors
believe that they will be forced to either file an alternate plan of
reorganization or liquidate under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In either
event, the Debtors believe that the Company's unsecured creditors (including the
holders of public debt) and equity holders would realize a less favorable
distribution of value, or, in certain cases, none at all, for their Claims or
Equity Interests. See Section II.I hereof and the Liquidation Analysis set forth
in Exhibit A attached hereto.

Treatment of Claims and Equity Interests

          The Plan is comprised of several Subplans. The following tables
summarize the Classes of Claims and Equity Interests under each Subplan,
projected aggregate amounts of such Classes, the treatment of such Classes, and
the projected recoveries of such Classes both in connection with the Plan. The
amounts in the column entitled "Projected Claims/Equity Interests" represents
amounts outstanding on the Petition Date.(1) The projected recoveries (if the
Plan is approved) are based upon certain assumptions contained in the Valuation
Analysis developed by Lazard Freres & Co. LLC set forth in Section II.J hereof.

          Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Lenders will receive (x) New
Bank Debt, (y) New CNC Preferred Stock and (z) New CNC Warrants in respect of
their claims for principal and interest through the Effective Date ("Total Bank
Debt Balance"). In the context of a consensual plan, the Lenders' distribution
are intended to reflect their structural seniority to creditors of CNC by virtue
of their claims against CIHC, as well as contractual subordination provisions
requiring the Lenders be paid in full in cash prior to any distributions in
respect of any Exchanged Note Claims and other contractually subordinated
Claims. In addition, certain of the Lenders' Claims are secured by various
collateral, including a pledge of the stock of CIHC and certain intercompany
notes, on a pari passu basis with the Secured Note Claims.

          In the context of a consensual Plan, the Holders of Claims
subordinated to the Lender Claims would receive the recoveries set forth in the
Plan even in the absence of the payment in full in cash of the Lender Claims on
the Effective Date.

          CNC Common Stock will have a value equal to Reorganized CNC's
enterprise value of approximately $3.8 million, less the Total Bank Debt Balance
(the "Equity Value").

          Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the New CNC Common Stock will be
distributed to holders of (i) Class 6B Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims against CIHC, (ii) Class 5A Exchanged Note Claims (on account of such
Claims and their related Class 5B Guarantee Claims), (iii) Class 6A Original
Note Claims, (iv) Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims against
CNC, (v) Class 10A Trust Related Claims, (vi) Class 11A Old CNC Preferred Stock
Interests, and (vii) Class 12A CNC Old Common Stock Interests. In addition, the
Holders of Class 4A Secured Note Claims may receive New CNC Common Stock. As
discussed below, Holders of Class 6B Claims and the Exchanged Note Claims (by
virtue of their related Guarantee Claims) have Claims against CIHC which are
structurally senior to all Claims against CNC. Holders of Secured Note Claims
have Claims against CNC which are secured by various collateral, including a
pledge of the stock of CIHC. As a result of such pledge, the Secured Note Claims
are structurally senior to all other Claims solely against CNC to the extent of
the value of this pledge.

          As discussed below, under the compromise embodied by the Plan, the
Holders of Claims at the CNC level are receiving not only more than they would
receive in a liquidation of the Debtors, they are also receiving more than they
would have received pursuant to a chapter 11 plan that strictly applied
contractual and structural subordination principles (the "Absolute Priority
Alternative").

     Does not give effect to dilution from equity issued to management or
     issuance of New CNC Warrants.

          Under the Plan, Holders of Class 6B Claims (Reorganizing Debtor
General Unsecured Claims against CIHC) will receive shares of Reorganized CNC
Common Stock representing their pro rata share of the Equity Value. The holders
of Secured Note Claims will receive either New Secured Notes or New CNC Common
Stock having an Equity Value equal to the Allowed amount of such Secured Note
Claims.

          Holders of Exchanged Note Claims, by virtue of their Class 5B
Guarantee Claims, under an Absolute Priority Alternative would be entitled to
receive property equal in value to the full amount of their Allowed Claims
before any value would be distributed to CNC (or any Holders of Claims against
CNC) as a result of CNC's equity ownership of CIHC. However, under the Plan,
Holders of Exchange Claims and the related Class 5B Guarantee Claims would allow
value to be distributed to Holders of Claims against CNC in an amount that is
significantly greater than the value to what such CNC Claims would be entitled
in an Absolute Priority Alternative. Such incremental value is being provided to
the Holders of Claims against CNC to ensure that the Debtors' reorganization
efforts are completed consensually and as expeditiously as possible. In
addition, such incremental recovery is also being provided to the Holders of
Claims against CNC in full and complete settlement of any claims or Causes of
Actions that may exist with respect to the Claims against CIHC (including,
without limitation, any claims or causes of action related to the Class 5B
Guarantee).

          Specifically, under the Plan, instead of the Exchange Note Claims
being paid in full prior to any distribution to the Holders of Claims against
CNC, the Exchange Note Claims will share the recovery they would be entitled to
on a pro rata basis at the CIHC level, together with any remaining Equity Value,
with the Original Note Claims, and the Reorganized Debtors General Unsecured
Claims against CNC on a pro rata basis; provided that for purposes of such pro
rata allocation the amount of the Exchange Note Claims will be increased by a
multiple of 1.7 to partially reflect their structural seniority. In addition,
the distributions to the Holders of the Exchange Note Claims and the Original
Note Claims reflects the benefit of the contractual subordination to which such
Claims are entitled with respect to the Trust Related Claims. Specifically,
under the Plan, the Total Bank Debt Balance upon which Holders of Lender Claims
receive their distributions includes post-petition interest. The subordination
language with respect to the Exchange Notes provides that Holders of the Lender
Claims will receive postpetition interest. The amount of postpetition interest
paid to the Lenders proportionally reduces the recovery to the Exchanged Notes
and Holders of Claims against CNC (a significant portion of whose recovery is
being provided as a result of the consent of Holders of the Exchange Notes). The
recoveries by Holders of Class 6B (Reorganized Debtors General Unsecured Claims
against CIHC) and Senior Notes will not be affected by the payment of
post-petition interest paid to the Banks.

          The formulation above results in a significantly higher recovery to
Holders of Claims against CNC than such Holders would receive in an Absolute
Priority Alternative. As set forth in table below, in an Absolute Priority
Alternative, Holders of (w) the Exchange Note Claims would receive a recovery of
approximately __%, (x) Original Note Claims would receive a recovery of
approximately __%, (y) Reorganized Debtors General Unsecured Claims would
receive a recovery of approximately __%, (z) Trust Related Claims would receive
a recovery of approximately 0%. As set forth in table __ below, under the Plan,
Holders of (i) the Exchanged Note Claims receive a recovery of approximately
__%, (ii) Original Note Claims receive a recovery of approximately __%, (iii)
Reorganized Debtors General Unsecured Claims would receive a recovery of
approximately __%, (iv) Trust Related Claims would receive a recovery of
approximately __%

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

A.        DESCRIPTION OF CONSECO'S BUSINESS

          1.   Corporate Structure

          CNC is the top tier holding company for our two operating businesses:
insurance and finance. Our insurance business is operated through subsidiaries
owned directly and indirectly by CIHC, an intermediate holding company that is
controlled by CNC. Our finance business is operated through CFC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CIHC, and its subsidiaries. An organizational chart of CNC and its
subsidiaries as of the Petition Date is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

          2.   The Company's Business

Insurance Business
------------------

          Our insurance subsidiaries develop, market and administer supplemental
health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance
products. We sell these products through three primary distribution channels:
career agents, professional independent producers and direct marketing. We had
over $5.4 billion of annual premium and asset accumulation product collections
during 2001 and $3.7 billion of collections during the nine months ended
September 30, 2002.

          Supplemental health products include Medicare supplement, long-term
care and specified-disease insurance products. During 2001, we collected
Medicare supplement premiums of $975.1 million, long-term care premiums of
$888.3 million, specified-disease premiums of $371.8 million, and other
supplemental health premiums of $109.3 million. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2002, we collected Medicare supplement premiums of $759.0 million,
long-term care premiums of $680.4 million, specified-disease premiums of $276.4
million, and other supplemental health premiums of $78.6 million. Supplemental
health premiums represented 49% of our total premiums collected from continuing
lines of business in 2001 and 54% of our total premiums collected from
continuing lines of business during the first nine months of 2002.

          Annuity products include equity-indexed annuity, traditional fixed
rate annuity and market value-adjusted annuity products. During 2001, we
collected annuity premiums of $1,223.7 million, or 26% of our total premiums
collected from continuing lines of business. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2002, we collected annuity premiums of $804.1 million, or 24% of
our total premiums collected from continuing lines of business.

          Life products include traditional life, universal life and other life
insurance products. During 2001, we collected life product premiums of $839.6
million, or 18% of our total premiums collected from continuing lines of
business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, we collected life
product premiums of $483.9 million, or 15% of our total premiums collected from
continuing lines of business.

          Conseco Capital Management, Inc. ("CCM"), a registered investment
adviser and wholly owned subsidiary of CNC, manages the investment portfolios of
our insurance subsidiaries. CCM had approximately $26.8 billion of assets (at
fair value) under management at September 30, 2002, of which $22.0 billion were
assets of Conseco's subsidiaries, $3.9 billion were assets held by registered
and structured products and $0.9 billion were assets owned by other parties. Our
investment philosophy is to maintain a largely investment-grade fixed-income
portfolio, provide adequate liquidity for expected liability durations and other
requirements and maximize total return through active investment management. As
of September 30, 2002, the average yield of our portfolio of fixed maturity
securities, computed on the cost basis, was approximately 6.9%. We are subject
to the risk that our investments will decline in value. This has occurred in the
past and may occur again. During the first nine months of 2002, we recognized
net realized investment losses of $524.9 million, compared to net realized
investment losses of $302.7 million during the comparable period of 2001. The
net realized investment losses during the first nine months of 2002 included:
(i) $489.8 million of writedowns of fixed maturity investments, equity

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

securities and other invested assets as a result of conditions which caused us
to conclude a decline in fair value of the investment was other than temporary
and (ii) $35.1 million of net losses from the sales of investments (primarily
fixed maturities) which generated proceeds of $15.6 billion.

          In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold Conseco Variable Insurance
Company, a company engaged in the variable annuity business. During 2001, we
decided to discontinue a large block of major medical business by non-renewal of
policies. Unless otherwise noted, the foregoing financial information and other
financial information in this Disclosure Statement excludes amounts related to
the business of Conseco Variable Insurance Company and the Company's major
medical line of business that is in run-off.

Finance Business
----------------

          Our finance business has historically provided a variety of finance
products, including manufactured housing and floor plan loans, home equity
mortgages, home improvement and consumer product loans and private label credit
cards. At September 30, 2002, we had managed receivables of $38.2 billion.

          CFC has historically provided financing for consumer purchases of
manufactured housing and floor plan loans to manufactured housing dealers. A
manufactured home is a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
designed to be a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation. During 2001,
we originated $2.5 billion of consumer contracts for manufactured housing
purchases, or 22% of our total finance company originations, and $2.1 billion of
floor plan loans. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables included $23.9
billion of contracts for manufactured housing purchases, or 63% of total managed
receivables, and $0.2 billion of floor plan loans. On November 25, 2002, CFC
discontinued the origination of manufactured housing loans as a result of CFC's
recent funding constraints and the unprofitable nature of these loans under
CFC's current financial condition and prevailing market conditions.

          Mortgage services products include home equity and home improvement
loans. During 2001, we originated $3.0 billion of contracts for these products,
or 27% of our total originations. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables
included $10.0 billion of contracts for home equity and home improvement loans,
or 26% of total managed receivables. During 2001, we originated $3.6 billion of
private label credit card receivables, primarily through our bank subsidiaries,
or 32% of our total originations. At September 30, 2002, our managed receivables
included $2.9 billion of contracts for credit card loans, or 7% of total managed
receivables. Private label credit card programs are offered to select retailers
with a core focus on the home improvement industry. We offer consumer finance
products through 90 home equity offices, approximately 1,280 home improvement
dealers and approximately 3,700 private label retail outlets.

          As described in "Planned Sale of CFC," we have agreed to sell all or
substantial portions of our finance business.

Government Regulation
---------------------

          Our insurance and finance subsidiaries are subject to extensive
regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they operate. This
regulation and supervision is primarily for the benefit and protection of our
customers and policyholders, and not for the benefit of our investors or
creditors.

          Insurance

          State laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad
regulatory authority, including the power to: (i) grant and revoke business
licenses; (ii) regulate and supervise trade practices and market conduct; (iii)
establish guaranty associations; (iv) license agents; (v) approve policy forms;
(vi) approve premium rates for some lines of business; (vii) establish reserve
requirements; (viii) prescribe the form and content of required financial
statements and reports; (ix) determine the reasonableness and adequacy of
statutory capital and surplus; (x) perform financial, market conduct and other
examinations; (xi) define acceptable accounting principles; (xii) regulate the
type and amount of permitted investments; and (xiii) limit the amount of
dividends and surplus debenture payments that can be paid without obtaining
regulatory approval.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>


          Since the August 9, 2002 announcement of our restructuring efforts, we
have been working closely with insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, New
York, Pennsylvania and Texas) in connection with their monitoring of the
operations and financial status of our insurance subsidiaries. The Commissioner
of Insurance for the State of Texas has acted as the lead regulator among these
states and has coordinated the oversight and monitoring efforts associated with
our financial restructuring.

          On October 30, 2002, Bankers National Life Insurance Company and
Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), our two insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas, each entered
into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas.
See "Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases -- Insurance Ratings and Regulatory
Issues" for a more complete discussion of the heightened regulatory scrutiny we
have experienced in connection with our restructuring.

          In addition to the limitations imposed by the laws described above and
the Texas consent orders, most states have also enacted laws or regulations with
respect to the activities of insurance holding company systems, including
payment of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by insurance companies, the
terms of transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates, and
other related matters. Various notice and reporting requirements generally apply
to transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates within an
insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the
transactions. These requirements may include prior regulatory approval or prior
notice for certain material transactions. Currently, the Company and its
insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to
such laws and regulations in the domiciliary states of the insurance
subsidiaries, and they routinely report to other jurisdictions.

          Most states have also enacted legislation or adopted administrative
regulations that affect the acquisition (or sale) of control of insurance
companies. The nature and extent of such legislation and regulations vary from
state to state. Generally, these regulations require an acquirer of control to
file detailed information concerning such acquirer and the plan of acquisition,
and to obtain administrative approval prior to the acquisition of control.
"Control" is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is rebuttably
presumed to exist if a person or group of affiliated persons directly or
indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another
person.

          The affiliated party transaction and change of control laws and
regulations described in the preceding two paragraphs may require notices to
and/or prior approvals by certain of our insurance regulators before the Plan of
Reorganization may be consummated. The specific required filings, notices and
approvals have not yet been determined, but are expected to be made or obtained
concurrently with the other voting and confirmation procedures required for the
Plan of Reorganization. See "Voting and Confirmation Procedure."

          On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state
regulators annually, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
("NAIC") calculates certain financial ratios to assist state regulators in
monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. A "usual range" of
results for each ratio is used as a benchmark. In the past, variances in certain
ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have resulted in inquiries from insurance
departments, to which we have responded. Such inquiries did not lead to any
restrictions affecting our operations.

          In addition, the NAIC issues model laws and regulations, many of which
have been adopted by state insurance regulators, relating to: (i) investment
reserve requirements; (ii) risk-based capital ("RBC") standards; (iii)
codification of insurance accounting principles; (iv) additional investment
restrictions; (v) restrictions on an insurance company's ability to pay
dividends; and (vi) product illustrations. The RBC Model Act provides for
different levels of regulatory attention based on the ratio of an insurance
company's total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital,
surplus, asset valuation reserve and certain other adjustments) to its required
RBC (such ratio is referred to herein as the "RBC ratio"). RBC standards are
designed to help identify insurance companies which are undercapitalized and
require specific regulatory actions in the event an insurer's RBC ratio falls
below specified levels.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>


          Most states mandate minimum benefit standards and loss ratios for
accident and health insurance policies. We are generally required to maintain,
with respect to our individual long-term care policies, minimum anticipated loss
ratios over the entire period of coverage of not less than 60 percent. With
respect to our Medicare supplement policies, we are generally required to attain
and maintain an actual loss ratio, after three years, of not less than 65
percent. We provide to the insurance departments of all states in which we
conduct business annual calculations that demonstrate compliance with required
minimum loss ratios for both long-term care and Medicare supplement insurance.
These calculations are prepared utilizing statutory lapse and interest rate
assumptions. In the event that we fail to maintain minimum mandated loss ratios,
our insurance subsidiaries could be required to provide retrospective refunds
and/or prospective rate reductions. We believe that our insurance subsidiaries
currently comply with all applicable mandated minimum loss ratios.

          During recent years, the health insurance industry has experienced
substantial changes, including those caused by healthcare legislation. Recent
federal and state legislation and legislative proposals relating to healthcare
reform contain features that could severely limit or eliminate our ability to
vary our pricing terms or apply medical underwriting standards with respect to
individuals which could have the effect of increasing our loss ratios and
adversely affecting our financial results. In particular, Medicare reform and
legislation concerning prescription drugs could affect our ability to price or
sell our products.

          In addition, proposals currently pending in Congress and some state
legislatures may also affect our financial results. These proposals include the
implementation of minimum consumer protection standards for inclusion in all
long-term care policies, including: guaranteed premium rates; protection against
inflation; limitations on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions; setting
standards for sales practices for long-term care insurance; and guaranteed
consumer access to information about insurers, including lapse and replacement
rates for policies and the percentage of claims denied. Enactment of any of
these proposals could affect our financial results.

          The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued
regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
("HIPAA") relating to standardized electronic transaction formats, code sets and
the privacy of member health information. These regulations and any
corresponding state legislation will affect the Company's administration of
health insurance.

          A number of states have passed or are considering legislation that
would limit the differentials in rates that insurers could charge for health
care coverages between new business and renewal business for similar demographic
groups. State legislation has also been adopted or is being considered that
would make health insurance available to all small groups by requiring coverage
of all employees and their dependents, by limiting the applicability of
pre-existing conditions exclusions, by requiring insurers to offer a basic plan
exempt from certain benefits as well as a standard plan, or by establishing a
mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees to all small group insurers.
Congress and various state legislators have from time to time proposed changes
to the health care system that could affect the relationship between health
insurers and their customers, including external review. We cannot predict with
certainty the effect that any proposals, if adopted, or legislative developments
could have on our insurance business.

          The asset management activities of CCM are subject to federal and
state securities, fiduciary (including ERISA) and other laws and regulations.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, state securities commissions and the Department of Labor are the
principal regulators of our asset management operations.

          Finance

          Our finance operations are subject to regulation by certain federal
and state regulatory authorities. A substantial portion of our consumer loans
and assigned sales contracts are originated or purchased by finance subsidiaries
licensed under applicable state law. The licensed entities are subject to
examination by, and reporting requirements of, the state administrative agencies
issuing these licenses. Our finance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and
regulations, which in certain states: (i) limit the amount, duration and charges
for such loans and contracts; (ii) require disclosure of certain loan terms and
regulate the content of documentation; (iii) place limitations on collection
practices; and (iv) govern creditor remedies.

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

The licenses granted are renewable and may be subject to revocation by the
respective issuing authority for violation of such state's laws and regulations.
Some states have adopted or are considering the adoption of consumer protection
laws or regulations that impose requirements or restrictions on lenders who make
certain types of loans secured by real estate.

          In addition to the finance companies licensed under state law, Mill
Creek Bank, Inc. ("Mill Creek Bank", formerly known as Conseco Bank, Inc.) and
Green Tree Retail Services Bank, Inc. ("Retail Bank"), both of which are wholly
owned subsidiaries of CFC, are regulated and subject to examination by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mill Creek Bank is also regulated and
examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Retail Bank is also
supervised and examined by the South Dakota Department of Banking. The ownership
of these entities does not subject the Company to regulation by the Federal
Reserve Board as a bank holding company. Mill Creek Bank has the authority to
engage generally in the banking business and may accept all types of deposits,
other than demand deposits. Retail Bank is limited by its charter to engage in
the credit card business and may issue only certificates of deposit in
denominations of $100,000 or greater. Mill Creek Bank and Retail Bank are
subject to regulations relating to capital adequacy, leverage, loans, loss
reserves, deposits, consumer protection, community reinvestment, payment of
dividends and transactions with affiliates.

          A number of states have usury and other consumer protection laws which
may place limitations on the amount of interest and other charges and fees
charged on loans originated in such state. Generally, state law has been
preempted by federal law under the Depositary Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980 (the "DIDA") which deregulates the rate of
interest, discount points and finance charges with respect to first lien
residential loans, including manufactured home loans and real estate secured
mortgage loans. As permitted under the DIDA, a number of states enacted
legislation timely opting out of coverage of either or both of the interest rate
and/or finance charge provisions of the DIDA. States may no longer opt out of
the interest rate provisions of the DIDA, but could in the future opt out of the
finance charge provisions. To be eligible for federal preemption for
manufactured home loans, our licensed finance companies must comply with certain
restrictions providing protection to consumers.

          Our finance operations are subject to regulation under other
applicable federal laws and regulations, the more significant of which include:
the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Home Owner Equity Protection Act, and certain rules and
regulations of the Federal Trade Commission.

          Our commercial lending operations are not subject to material
regulation in most states, although certain states do require licensing. In
addition, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act apply to
commercial loans to small businesses.

          We have internal controls designed to manage the risks associated with
our finance activities. However, there is a risk that one or more employees may
circumvent these controls, as has occurred at other financial institutions.

Competition
-----------

          Each of the markets in which we operate is highly competitive, and our
highly leveraged position has had a material adverse impact on our ability to
compete in these markets. The financial services industry consists of a large
number of companies, some of which are larger and have greater capital,
technological and marketing resources, access to capital and other sources of
liquidity at a lower cost, broader and more diversified product lines and larger
staffs than Conseco. An expanding number of banks, securities brokerage firms
and other financial intermediaries also market insurance products or offer
competing products, such as mutual fund products, traditional bank investments
and other investment and retirement funding alternatives. We also compete with
many of these companies and others in providing services for fees. In most
areas, competition is based on a number of factors, including pricing, service
provided to distributors and policyholders and ratings. Conseco's subsidiaries
must also compete with their competitors to attract and retain the allegiance of
dealers, vendors, contractors, manufacturers, retailers and agents.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>


          An important competitive factor for life insurance companies is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. Agents,
insurance brokers and marketing companies who market our products and
prospective purchasers of our products use the ratings of our insurance
subsidiaries as one factor in determining which insurer's products to market or
purchase. Ratings have the most impact on our annuity and interest-sensitive
life insurance products. Insurance financial strength ratings are opinions
regarding an insurance company's financial capacity to meet the obligations of
its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. They are not directed
toward the protection of investors, and such ratings are not recommendations to
buy, sell or hold securities.

          In July 2002, A.M. Best Company, a nationally recognized insurance
company ratings organization, lowered the financial strength ratings of our
primary insurance subsidiaries from "A- (excellent)" to "B++ (very good)" and
placed the ratings "under review with negative implications." In August 2002,
A.M. Best further downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B (fair)". These ratings downgrades caused sales of
our insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase, which had a material adverse impact on our financial results. In some
cases, the ratings downgrades also caused defections among our sales force of
agents and/or increases in the commissions we had to pay to retain them. The
effect of these ratings downgrades is further discussed in "Events Leading to
the Chapter 11 Cases - Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues."

          Conseco's leveraged condition and liquidity difficulties also have
severely impacted the operations of our finance business. For a more complete
discussion of the effect of our leveraged condition and liquidity difficulties
on our finance business, see "Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases - Status of
CFC; Strategic Alternatives Considered."

Employees
---------

          At December 31, 2002, CNC and its subsidiaries had approximately
10,100 employees, including: (i) 4,300 employees supporting our insurance
operations; (ii) 5,400 employees supporting our finance operations; and (iii)
400 employees supporting our holding company and shared services. None of our
employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

          For additional information about the Company's business operations,
refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2001 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2002. These filings are available by visiting the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov.

B.        EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF CNC AND CIHC

          1.   CNC

               (a)  Bank Debt

          CNC has a $1.5 billion credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility")
with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and various other lending
institutions (the "Bank Group"). The Senior Credit Facility was scheduled to
mature on December 31, 2003 and is currently fully drawn. Approximately $38
million of accrued and unpaid interest was added to the outstanding principal
amount of the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a waiver dated September 8,
2002. In addition, as of the Petition Date, there was an aggregate of
approximately $6.1 million of unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facility.

               (b)  Guarantee of D&O Facilities

          Beginning in 1996, certain officers and directors of Conseco borrowed
money to purchase common stock of CNC under credit facilities provided by Bank
of America, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank and various other lending institutions
(individually, a "D&O Facility", and collectively, the "D&O Facilities"). Until
the fall of 2000, there were three D&O Facilities: the $245 million D&O Facility
entered into in 1997 (which included the original purchasers in 1996 plus new
purchasers in 1997); the $181 million D&O Facility entered into in 1998; and the
$144 million D&O Facility entered into in 1999.

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

The aggregate amount of the D&O Facilities guaranteed as of the Petition Date
was approximately $481.3 million. In addition, as of the Petition Date, CNC owed
approximately $4.0 million of waiver consideration and approximately $9.6
million in interest with respect to the D&O Facilities.

          In May 2000, the 1999 D&O Facility was refinanced to add additional
collateral in the form of pledges of stock of CIHC, CFC and CCM and certain
intercompany notes. In the fall of 2000, most of the borrowers refinanced the
existing facilities to extend the maturity date of the obligations to December
31, 2003 (the scheduled maturity date of the Senior Credit Facility). Certain of
the officers and directors who are borrowers under the 1998 D&O Facility chose
not to refinance (by not signing the agreement), thereby creating, in effect, an
additional tranche: the 1998 non-refinanced facility.

               (c)  The Secured Notes

          In 1993, CNC issued $200,000,000 of 8.125% senior notes due February
15, 2003 (the "8.125% Secured Notes"). In 1994, CCP Insurance, Inc. ("CCP")
issued $200,000,000 of 10.5% senior notes due December 15, 2004 (the "10.5%
Secured Notes"). CNC acquired CCP by merger on August 31, 1995 and assumed CCP's
obligations under the 10.5% Secured Notes in connection with the merger.

          We sometimes refer to the 8.125% Secured Notes and the 10.5% Secured
Notes collectively as the "Secured Notes." The Secured Notes are secured by the
stock of CIHC, CCM, CFC and certain of its subsidiaries and certain intercompany
notes. It is anticipated that substantially all of CFC's assets will be sold in
connection with the Company's reorganization. If certain of these assets have
been pledged to the holders of the Secured Notes, and if proceeds of these
pledged assets are used to pay the Secured Notes, then CFC may assert, by
subrogation, the rights of such holders against the Reorganizing Debtors. As of
the Petition Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Secured
Notes was approximately $88 million and there was an aggregate of approximately
$5.7 million of unpaid interest on the Secured Notes.

               (d)  The Original Notes

          Between 1998 and 2001, CNC issued the following series of senior
notes: (i) $450,000,000 of 8.5% senior notes due October 15, 2002 (the "8.5%
Original Notes"); (ii) $250,000,000 of 6.4% senior notes due February 10, 2003
(the "6.4% Original Notes"); (iii) $800,000,000 of 8.75% senior notes due
February 9, 2004 (the "8.75% Original Notes"); (iv) $250,000,000 of 6.8% senior
notes due June 15, 2005 (the "6.8% Original Notes"); (v) $550,000,000 of 9.0%
senior notes due October 15, 2006 (the "9.0% Original Notes"); and (vi)
$400,000,000 of 10.75% senior notes due June 15, 2008 (the "10.75% Original
Notes").

          We sometimes refer to the foregoing series of senior notes
collectively as the "Original Notes." As of the Petition Date, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Original Notes was approximately $1.17
billion, and there was an aggregate of approximately $72.2 million of unpaid
interest on the Original Notes.

               (e)  The Exchange Notes

          In connection with an exchange offer completed in April 2002, CNC
issued: (i) $991,000 of 8.5% senior notes due October 15, 2003, in exchange for
an equal amount of 8.5% Original Notes due October 15, 2002 (the "8.5% Exchange
Notes"); (ii) $14,936,000 of 6.4% senior notes due February 10, 2004 in exchange
for an equal amount of 6.4% Original Notes due February 10, 2003 (the "6.4%
Exchange Notes"); (iii) $364,294,000 of 8.75% senior notes due August 9, 2006 in
exchange for an equal amount of 8.75% Original Notes due February 9, 2004 (the
"8.75% Exchange Notes"); (iv) $150,783,000 of 6.8% senior notes due June 15,
2007 in exchange for an equal amount of 6.8% Original Notes due June 15, 2005
(the "6.8% Exchange Notes"); (v) $399,200,000 of 9.0% senior notes due April 15,
2008 in exchange for an equal amount of 9.0% Original Notes due October 15, 2006
(the "9.0% Exchange Notes"); and (vi) $362,433,000 of 10.75% senior notes due
June 15, 2009 in exchange for an equal amount of 10.75% Original Notes due June
15, 2008 (the "10.75% Exchange Notes").


                                      -15-
<PAGE>


          We sometimes refer to the foregoing series of senior notes
collectively as the "Exchange Notes." The Exchange Notes are guaranteed by CIHC
and are otherwise identical to the corresponding series of Original Notes in all
material respects but for the fact that they bear a CIHC guarantee and their
respective maturity dates. As of the Petition Date, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Exchange Notes was approximately $1.29 billion, and
there was an aggregate of approximately $78.3 million of unpaid interest on the
Exchange Notes.

               (f)  Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debentures

          The following securities have been issued by subsidiary trusts of CNC:
9.16% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "9.16% TOPrS"); 8.70% Trust
Pass-Through Securities (the "8.70% TRuPS"); 8.796% Capital Securities (the
"8.796% Capital Securities"); 6.75% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the
"6.75% TOPrS"); 8.70% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "8.70% TOPrS");
9% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (the "9% TOPrS"); and 9.44% Trust
Originated Preferred Securities (the "9.44% TOPrS"). We sometimes refer to the
9.16% TOPrS, 8.70% TRuPS, 8.796% Capital Securities, 6.75% TOPrS, 8.70% TOPrS,
9.00% TOPrS and 9.44% TOPrS collectively as the "Trust Preferred Securities."

          Each trust used the proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Preferred
Securities to purchase subordinated debentures from CNC (the "Subordinated
Debentures"). The interest rate and other terms of each series of Trust
Preferred Securities mirror the terms of the applicable underlying Subordinated
Debentures issued by CNC. The holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are
entitled to preferred dividend payments from the trust, payable from the
interest payments received from CNC on the underlying Subordinated Debentures.
CNC provides a guarantee to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities of the
amounts due on such Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent that the
trust has received interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures. As of the
Petition Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated
Debentures was approximately $1.9 billion, and there was an aggregate of
approximately $89.1 million of unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures.

               (g)  Preferred Stock and Common Stock

          CNC has two outstanding series of preferred stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Common-Linked Convertible Preferred Stock, and has committed
to authorize a third series of preferred stock, Series G Preferred Stock. As of
December 31, 2002, there were: (i) 90,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock,
$10,000 stated value per share, issued and outstanding (the "Series E Preferred
Stock"); (ii) 2,855,502 shares of Series F Common-Linked Convertible Preferred
Stock, $192.50 stated value per share, issued and outstanding (the "Series F
Preferred Stock"); and (iii) no shares of Series G Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding (the "Series G Preferred Stock").

          As of December 31, 2002, CNC had 346.0 million shares of common stock,
no par value, issued and outstanding. The common stock (and all other listed
securities of CNC) was delisted from the NYSE effective September 25, 2002. See
"Events Leading to the Chapter 11 Cases - Delisting of Common Stock and Other
Listed Securities."

          2.   CIHC

               (a)  Guarantees of CNC and CFC Debt

          Although CIHC has no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money
(other than for intercompany notes), it is the guarantor of CNC's Senior Credit
Facility. The Senior Credit Facility currently fully drawn, and approximately
$38 million of accrued and unpaid interest has been added to the outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to a waiver dated
September 8, 2002. As of the Petition Date, there was an aggregate of
approximately $6.1 million of unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facility.
CIHC is the guarantor of an aggregate principal amount of $125 million in
respect of CFC's residual and warehouse facilities with Lehman Brothers, Inc.
and certain of its affiliates ("Lehman"). CIHC is the guarantor of an aggregate
principal amount of $125 million in respect of CFC's swingline debt and cash
management facility with U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank"). CIHC is

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

the secondary guarantor on an aggregate principal amount of approximately $481.3
million in respect of the D&O Facilities, for which CNC is the primary
guarantor. CIHC is the guarantor of an aggregate principal amount of $1.29
billion of Exchange Notes issued by CNC.

               (b)  Preferred Stock and Common Stock

          CIHC has authorized three series of preferred stock: (i) 1994 Series
Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value per share (the "1994 Series Preferred
Stock"); (ii) $2.32 Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock, $0.01 stated value
per share (the "$2.32 Preferred Stock"); and (iii) 1998 Series Redeemable
Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value per share (the "1998 Series Preferred
Stock"). As of December 31, 2002, there were 151,531.319 shares of 1994 Series
Preferred Stock, 1,200,000 shares of $2.32 Preferred Stock and 90,000 shares of
1998 Series Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.

          As of December 31, 2002, CIHC had 1,001.041 shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding, 1,000 shares of which were
held by CNC and 1.041 shares of which were held by Conseco Annuity Assurance
Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CIHC.

C.        EVENTS LEADING TO THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

          1.   Background to the Restructuring

          Conseco commenced operations in 1982 and grew rapidly through
acquisitions, including the acquisition of 19 separate insurance groups and
related businesses and the acquisition of Green Tree Financial Corporation in
1998. The acquisition of Green Tree (renamed "Conseco Finance Corp.") served as
the platform for Conseco's entry into the consumer finance business.

          In order to fund these acquisitions and grow its businesses, CNC, our
parent holding company, incurred substantial indebtedness through borrowings
under bank credit facilities and the issuance of securities in public capital
markets. CIHC, our intermediate holding company, also incurred significant
indebtedness in the form of guarantees. See "Existing Capital Structure of CNC
and CIHC." Between 1998 and 2000, CNC incurred $3.6 billion in new debt and
trust preferred obligations, primarily to fund the business of CFC following its
acquisition. In addition to increased indebtedness levels, we also began to
recognize impairment charges because the actual performance of CFC's securitized
loan portfolios did not meet the assumptions that were used in establishing the
value of the interest-only securities and servicing rights.

          During the past two years, we undertook efforts to reduce our parent
company debt. These efforts primarily focused on the sale of non-strategic
assets to meet principal and interest payment obligations. We also took a number
of other actions designed to reduce parent company debt and increase the
efficiency of our business operations. The actions with respect to our finance
business included: (i) the sale, closing or runoff of several business units
(including asset-based lending, vendor leasing, bankcards, transportation, park
construction and floorplan lending); (ii) monetization of certain on-balance
sheet financial assets through sales or as collateral for additional borrowings;
(iii) cost savings and restructuring of ongoing businesses such as streamlining
of credit origination operations in the manufactured housing and home equity
divisions; and (iv) substantial decreases in the origination of certain lines of
products in certain business segments, particularly in the manufactured housing
segment. The actions with respect to our insurance business included: (i) the
sale of our variable annuity business; (ii) reinsurance transactions of various
insurance blocks; and (iii) the division of our insurance segment into two, more
efficient, operating groups.

          In addition to these measures, in April 2002, we extended the
maturities of approximately $1.29 billion in principal amount of our senior
notes by one year to two and one-half years through an exchange offer in an
effort to improve our financial flexibility and enhance our ability to refinance
our public debt.

          Notwithstanding these initiatives, the Company's financial position
continued to deteriorate. For the six months ended June 30, 2002, CNC suffered a
net loss applicable to common stock of $4,380.1

                                      -17-


<PAGE>

million, including the cumulative effect of an accounting charge for a goodwill
impairment of $2,949.2 million and the establishment of a deferred tax valuation
reserve of $1,003.0 million. This loss reduced CNC's shareholders' equity to
$533.0 million. The reduction in shareholders' equity negatively impacted the
financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the capital market
ratings of our outstanding parent company securities, and effectively precluded
us from raising significant amounts of additional capital in the public markets.
The net loss for the second quarter, including the establishment of a deferred
tax valuation reserve, resulted in a breach of the debt to capitalization ratio
covenant in the Senior Credit Facility, although we did obtain temporary waivers
from the relevant lenders. These developments also made it significantly more
difficult to obtain regulatory approvals of dividend payments from our insurance
subsidiaries.

          2.   Announcement of Restructuring Plan; Events of Default

          As a result of these developments, on August 9, 2002, we announced
that we had engaged legal and financial advisors to begin discussions with
creditors in order to effectuate a fundamental restructuring of the Company's
capital structure. We also announced that we did not make the August 2002
interest payments on the 6.4% Original Notes, 6.4% Exchange Notes, 8.75%
Original Notes and 8.75% Exchange Notes. Since the August 9, 2002 announcement,
we have not made any interest or principal payments on any of our direct
corporate obligations, nor have we made any distributions on our Trust Preferred
Securities. The failure to make the interest payments on these notes within the
30-day grace period constituted an event of default under the notes, which gave
the holders of the notes the right to accelerate the maturity of all principal
and past due interest. We did not pay the $224.9 million of principal (plus
accrued interest) that was due on October 15, 2002 under the 8.5% Original
Notes. Our default with respect to the payment of principal on these notes also
resulted in defaults under approximately $4.0 billion principal amount of debt
obligations, approximately $481.3 million of obligations under the D&O
Facilities and approximately $1.9 billion of Subordinated Indentures (and the
corresponding Trust Preferred Securities) through cross-default provisions
contained in the respective governing instruments. If the holders of such
indebtedness or preferred securities had exercised their rights to accelerate
the maturity of all principal and interest due, we would not have been able to
satisfy these obligations.

          On September 9, 2002, Conseco received temporary waivers of the
covenant violations with respect to the Senior Credit Facility and the D&O
Facilities from the relevant lenders. These waivers expired on October 17, 2002.
On that date, Conseco obtained forbearance agreements from the relevant lenders
pursuant to which the lenders agreed to temporarily refrain from exercising
default-related remedies with respect to certain specified events of default
under the Senior Credit Facility and the guarantees of the D&O Facilities. These
forbearance agreements were scheduled to expire on November 27, 2002, but were
extended on that date to January 11, 2003, subject to various conditions. Upon
filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the forbearance agreements terminated and were
superseded by the automatic stay provisions under section 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

          3.   Delisting of Common Stock and Other Listed Securities

          After the issuance of our press release on August 9, 2002, the NYSE
halted trading in CNC's common stock and other listed securities. On August 12,
2002, the NYSE issued a public announcement of the suspension of trading. The
Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently granted the NYSE's application
for removal from listing and registration with respect to the following CNC
securities: (i) common stock, (ii) 8 1/8% Secured Notes, (iii) 10 1/2% Secured
Notes, (iv) 9.16% TOPrS, (v) 8.70% TOPrS, (vi) 9% TOPrS and (vii) 9.44% TOPrS,
effective on the opening of the trading session on September 25, 2002.

          4.   Ratings Downgrades of CNC Securities

          As a result of the events leading up to our August 9, 2002
announcement and subsequent events, we have experienced a number of ratings
downgrades with respect to our outstanding securities. On September 9, 2002, our
senior debt ratings were lowered from "C" to "D" by Fitch IBCA. Fitch employs a
system of 12 national ratings, ranging from "AAA" to "D" with pluses and minuses
used to indicate the relative position of a credit within a ratings category.

                                      -18-

<PAGE>


          On October 4, 2002, Standard & Poor's lowered our senior debt rating
from "CC" to "D". Standard & Poor's maintains 10 ratings categories, ranging
from "AAA (Extremely strong)" to "D (Defaulted)" with pluses and minuses used to
indicate relative positions within each category.

          On October 25, 2002, the credit rating for our senior notes was
downgraded to "Ca" by Moody's, which said its ratings outlook for us is
developing. Moody's employs a system of nine national ratings, ranging from
"Aaa" to "C" with modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to indicate the relative strength or
weakness within each rating. "Ca" is the eighth best rating out of nine. In its
October 25, 2002 release, Moody's stated that "the Ca senior unsecured rating
reflects the heightened uncertainty surrounding Conseco's liquidity and
financial flexibility, and the residual value of the company, a key determinant
of the recovery value for debtholders."

          Immediately prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, our Trust
Preferred Securities were rated "D" by Standard & Poor's, "D" by Fitch and "C"
by Moody's. The ratings of our securities made it impossible for Conseco to
issue additional securities in the public markets.

          5.   Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues

          An important competitive factor for our insurance subsidiaries is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. See
"Description of Conseco's Business - The Company's Business - Competition". In
July 2002, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B++ (Very Good)" and placed the ratings "under review
with negative implications." On August 14, 2002, A.M. Best further lowered the
financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries from "B++ (very
good)" to "B (fair)." A.M. Best ratings for the industry currently range from
"A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)" and some companies are not rated. An
"A++" ranking indicates superior overall performance and a strong ability to
meet obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The "B" rating is
assigned to companies which have, on balance, fair balance sheet strength,
operating performance and business profile, when compared to the standards
established by A.M. Best, and have an ability in A.M. Best's opinion to meet
their current obligations to policyholders, but their financial strength is
vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions. The
rating reflects A.M. Best's view of the uncertainty surrounding our
restructuring initiatives and the potential adverse financial impact on the
subsidiaries if negotiations are protracted and execution of the restructuring
plan is delayed. Standard & Poor's has given our insurance subsidiaries a
financial strength rating of "B+". Rating categories from "BB" to "CCC" are
classified as "vulnerable," and pluses and minuses show the relative standing
within a category. In Standard & Poor's view, an insurer rated "B" has the
capacity to meet its financial commitments but adverse business conditions could
lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments.

          These ratings downgrades caused sales of our insurance products to
decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to increase. In some cases, the
downgrades also caused defections among our independent agent sales force and
increases in the commissions we had to pay to retain them. These events have had
a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further downgrades by A.M.
Best or Standard & Poor's would likely have further material and adverse effects
on our financial results and liquidity.

          Since the announcement of our restructuring efforts on August 9, 2002,
we have been working closely with insurance regulators in each of the states in
which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled (Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, New
York, Pennsylvania and Texas) in connection with their monitoring of the
operations and financial status of our insurance subsidiaries. The Commissioner
of Insurance for the State of Texas has acted as the lead regulator among these
states and has principally coordinated the oversight and monitoring efforts
associated with our financial restructuring.

          On October 30, 2002, Bankers National Life Insurance Company and
Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), our two insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas, each entered
into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas
whereby they agreed: (i) not to request any dividends or other distributions
before January 1, 2003 and, thereafter, not to pay any dividends or other
distributions to parent companies outside of the insurance system without

                                      -19-

<PAGE>


the prior approval of the Texas Insurance Commissioner; (ii) to continue to
maintain sufficient capitalization and reserves as required by the Texas
Insurance Code; (iii) to request approval from the Texas Insurance Commissioner
before making any disbursements not in the ordinary course of business; (iv) to
complete any pending transactions previously reported to the proper insurance
regulatory officials prior to and during Conseco's restructuring, unless not
approved by the Texas Insurance Commissioner; (v) to obtain a commitment from
CNC and CIHC to maintain their infrastructure, employees, systems and physical
facilities prior to and during Conseco's restructuring; and (vi) to continue to
permit the Texas Insurance Commissioner to examine its books, papers, accounts,
records and affairs. The consent orders do not prohibit the payment of fees in
the ordinary course of business pursuant to existing administrative, investment
management and marketing agreements with our non-insurance subsidiaries.

          6.   Status of CFC; Strategic Alternatives Considered

          During the course of the recent economic slowdown, loans originated by
our finance subsidiaries have suffered a sustained period of increased
delinquencies, foreclosures and losses and our finance subsidiaries have
incurred increased costs in servicing these loans, all of which have had a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
These conditions, coupled with our leveraged condition and liquidity
difficulties, have severely impacted the operations of CFC, and eliminated CFC's
access to the securitization markets. The securitization markets historically
have been CFC's main source of funding. The loss of access to the securitization
markets has severely affected CFC's ability to originate, purchase and sell
loans. It has also affected the value of the retained interests CFC holds in
securitization manufactured housing trusts, since CFC relied on the
securitization markets to finance the sale of repossessed manufactured housing
units owned by those trusts, which often helped to minimize the loss on
defaulted loans (compared to liquidating those assets through a manufactured
housing wholesale channel).

          On October 22, 2002, CNC announced that its board of directors
approved a plan to sell or seek new investors for the finance businesses and
that the investment banking firms of Lazard Freres & Co., LLC and Credit Suisse
First Boston had been engaged to pursue various alternatives, including securing
new investors and/or selling CFC's three lines of business: (i) manufactured
housing; (ii) mortgage and home equity services; and (iii) consumer finance
(including a potential sale, joint venture or similar transaction with respect
to CFC's servicing platforms). For a discussion of the sale process, see
"Planned Sale of CFC."

          As of the Petition Date, CFC's remaining liquidity sources were a
warehouse facility (the "Warehouse Facility") and a residual facility ("Residual
Facility") with Lehman and a bank credit facility with U.S. Bank (the "U.S. Bank
Facility," and together with the Warehouse Facility and Residual Facility, the
"CFC Facilities"). The direct borrower under (i) the Warehouse Facility is CFC's
non-debtor subsidiary Green Tree Finance Corp. - Five ("GTFC"), and (ii) the
Residual Facility is CFC's non-debtor subsidiary Green Tree Residual Finance
Corp. I ("GTRFC"). The Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility are fully
guaranteed by CFC and, up to an aggregate of $125 million, by CIHC. CFC was the
direct borrower under the U.S. Bank Facility, which was also guaranteed by CIHC
up to an aggregate of $125 million.

          Prior to the Petition Date, CFC was in default under the CFC
Facilities as a result of (i) cross-defaults triggered by CNC's defaulting on
its debt obligations, (ii) cross-defaults among the U.S. Bank Facility, the
Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility, (iii) failure to make payment of
guarantees on the B-2 securities issued in connection with securitizations of
manufactured housing receivables; and (iv) breaches of several financial
covenants under the CFC Facilities. CFC entered into forbearance agreements with
Lehman with respect to the Warehouse Facility and Residual Facility and with
U.S. Bank with respect to U.S. Bank Facility, pursuant to which Lehman and U.S.
Bank agreed to temporarily refrain from exercising any rights arising from
events of default that occurred under each CFC Facility prior to the Petition
Date.

          The Warehouse Facility is a repurchase facility under which primarily
newly originated manufactured housing, home equity, home improvement and
recreational vehicle loans originated by CFC or affiliates of CFC and
transferred to GTFC are sold by GTFC to Lehman with an agreement to repurchase
those loans at a later date and at a higher price. The price differential
reflects the cost of financing. The

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

Warehouse Facility provides funding to CFC for new loan origination. The
Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility are cross-collateralized.

          The Residual Facility is collateralized by retained interests in
securitizations. CFC is required to maintain collateral based on current
estimated fair values in accordance with the terms of such facility. Due to the
decrease in the estimated fair value of its retained interests, CFC's collateral
was $128.9 million deficient at September 30, 2002 (as calculated in accordance
with the relevant transaction documents). Pursuant to the forbearance agreement
entered into with Lehman on December 20, 2002, Lehman agreed not to accelerate
the repayment of the Residual Facility based on the collateral deficiency
through June 1, 2003. Under the terms of this forbearance agreement, Lehman
retains the cash flows from CFC's retained interests pledged under this facility
and applies those cash flows to the margin deficit. As mentioned above, this
forbearance agreement is subject to a number of conditions that may cause it to
terminate prior to June 1, 2003.

          The filing by CNC, CIHC and CFC of a Chapter 11 petition triggered
additional defaults under the CFC Facilities.

          On December 19, 2002, shortly after the filing of the Chapter 11
Cases, the U.S. Bank Facility was paid-off with the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court with a portion of the proceeds of the debtor-in-possession ("DIP")
financing provided by U.S. Bank and FPS DIP LLC, an affiliate of Fortress
Investment Group LLC ("Fortress"), J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC. ("Flowers") and
Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. ("Cerberus"). The DIP financing is for up to
$125,000,000. The DIP financing motion was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on
January 14, 2003.

          On December 20, 2002, CFC, GTFC, and GTRFC, entered into several
agreements with Lehman: (i) providing that Lehman temporarily refrain from
exercising any rights arising from events of default that occurred under each
relevant CFC Facility (including, but not limited to, those arising out of CNC,
CIHC and CFC filing for chapter 11 relief) until June 1, 2003; (ii) indirectly
providing CFC with up to $25,000,000 in post-petition financing by allowing GTFC
to provide intercompany loans to CFC with cash flows obtained from the Warehouse
Facility; (iii) decreasing the capacity of the Warehouse Facility to a maximum
of $250,000,000; and (iv) otherwise amending the Warehouse Facility and the
Residual Facility. These agreements are subject to a number of conditions that
may cause them to terminate prior to June 1, 2003.

          As a result of CFC's defaults and the agreements entered into with
Lehman on December 20, 2002, CFC may not draw funds from the Residual Facility.

          7.   Recent Financial Results

          On November 19, 2002, CNC reported a net loss of $1,769.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2002. This loss was primarily the result
of: (i) impairment charges related to our interest-only securities and servicing
rights held by our finance subsidiary of $701.3 million; (ii) impairment charges
related to goodwill of $500.0 million; (iii) realized investment losses related
to our investment portfolio of $271.7 million; (iv) an increase to our reserves
with respect to long-term care insurance products for changes in estimates of
$110.0 million; and (v) a loss on the sale of Conseco Variable Insurance Company
of $139.9 million. As a result of this loss, CNC's shareholders' deficit was
$811.8 million at September 30, 2002.

          8.   The Prepetition Committees

          In the fall of 2002, we commenced discussions with a committee
representing the Bank Group with respect to the financial condition of the
Company and the proposed restructuring (the "Prepetition Bank Committee"). The
members of the Prepetition Bank Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Bank of
America, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank and Angelo, Gordon & Co. Bank of America, as
administrative agent for the Senior Credit Facility and some of the D&O
Facilities, retained Davis Polk & Wardwell as its legal advisor and Ernst &
Young and Greenhill & Co., LLC as its financial advisors.

          In August 2002, the Debtors commenced discussions with certain holders
of the Secured Notes, Original Notes and Exchange Notes with respect to the
financial condition of the Company and the proposed restructuring (the
"Prepetition Noteholder Committee"). The members of the Prepetition Noteholder
Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC,
First Pacific Advisors, Appaloosa Management Company, Barclays Bank, PLC,
Calvert Group, Ltd., HSBC Bank USA (as indenture trustee) and Whippoorwill
Associates, Inc. The Prepetition Noteholder Committee retained Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson as its legal advisor and Houlihan Lokey Howard &
Zukin LLP as its financial advisor.

          In October 2002, the Debtors commenced discussions with certain
holders of the Trust Preferred Securities with respect to the financial
condition of the Company and the proposed restructuring (the "Prepetition Trust
Preferred Securities Committee"). The members of the Prepetition Trust Preferred
Securities Committee, as of the Petition Date, were Oppenheimer Capital, United
Capital Markets, Marion Polk Real Estate and Smith Hayes Financial. The
Prepetition Trust Preferred Securities Committee retained Saul Ewing LLP as its
legal advisor and Raymond James as its financial advisor.

          The Debtors entered into extensive arms' length negotiations with the
Prepetition Bank Committee, Prepetition Noteholder Committee and the Prepetition
Trust Preferred Securities Committee regarding the terms of a consensual
restructuring of the Debtors. Shortly before the Petition Date, the Debtors
reached a non-binding agreement in principle with respect to the general terms
of a restructuring with the Prepetition Bank Committee and Prepetition
Noteholder Committee.(1) The Debtors, and not the members of any of the
foregoing committees, are the proponents of the Plan.

D.        PLANNED SALE OF CFC

          On December 19, 2002, CFC and certain of its subsidiaries entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with CFN, an
affiliate of Fortress, Flowers and Cerberus, pursuant to which CFC has agreed to
sell substantially all of its businesses and assets (the "CFC Assets") in a sale
pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition to other conditions
customary to transactions of this kind, the Asset Purchase Agreement is subject
to the following conditions: (i) CFN shall be the servicer or successor servicer
with respect to all of CFC's servicing rights; (ii) the servicing fees that CFC
receives as servicer of the securitized pools of manufactured housing
receivables must have been (A) increased to at least 125 basis points per annum
of each relevant pool and (B) granted seniority in payment priority in the
related securitization payment waterfalls; (iii) the Bankruptcy Court shall have
entered an order authorizing and approving the sale of the CFC Assets, which
order shall (A) provide (among other things) that the buyer is entitled to the
protections provided to a good faith purchaser under Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code, (B) provide that (except as expressly permitted by the Asset
Purchase Agreement) all persons and entities holding interests or claims of any
kind and nature with respect to the CFC Assets shall be enjoined from asserting,
prosecuting or otherwise pursuing such interests and claims of any kind and
nature against CFN, its successors or assigns, or the CFC Assets, and (C) exempt
the sale of the CFC Assets from the imposition and payment of any and all
recording taxes, stamp taxes, transfer taxes, or similar taxes pursuant to
section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (iv) the outstanding amount of the
indebtedness with Lehman shall not exceed $975 million during any time from the
execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement until the date of the closing of the
sale of the CFC Assets ("Closing Date").

          The CFC Assets do not include any businesses or assets that CFN
identifies as excluded businesses or assets during the period prior to the
Closing Date. With certain limited exceptions, such exclusions would not result
in a purchase price adjustment. However, in accordance with the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, CFN has given irrevocable notice to CFC that, subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth above, it will acquire
CFC's Manufactured Housing business (including, without limitation, the
Manufactured Housing servicing platform).

---------------
1    The Official Committee continues to review the Plan and this Disclosure
     Statement to ensure that they accurately reflect the agreement in
     principal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Official
     Committee has advised the Debtors that it does not support the release and
     indemnification provisions in the current form.



                                      -22-
<PAGE>


          The purchase price for the CFC Assets will be the sum of (i) the
amount owed by CFC under the Warehouse Facility and the Residual Facility to
Lehman; (ii) the outstanding amount under CFC's DIP facility as of the Closing
Date up to a maximum of $125 million; and (iii) certain liabilities assumed by
CFN. The purchase price is subject to adjustment if CFN elects to exclude the
stock of Mill Creek Bank from the transaction.

          The Debtors believe that, considering all surrounding facts and
circumstances, the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement
maximize the value obtainable from the CFC Assets for all relevant
constituencies. However, there can be no assurance that these transactions will
be completed, or if completed, that they will satisfy the Debtors' expectations.
Even assuming that the sale of the CFC Assets is completed and CFC receives the
proceeds from the sale of the CFC Assets in the amount and as otherwise set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, such proceeds will be applied entirely to
satisfy CFC's existing creditors, and, accordingly, such proceeds will not be
available to Reorganized CNC through its ownership of CFC's equity or to Holders
of Claims against or Equity Interests in Reorganized CNC. In accordance with
section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, CFC is permitted and will continue to seek alternative transactions
that may provide greater value to CFC and its creditors than the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, CFN may be entitled
to receive certain termination fees and expense reimbursements under certain
circumstances pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.

          CFC is also undertaking efforts to restructure its manufactured
housing business by reducing the negative cash flows that currently result from
this portfolio by: (i) increasing the amount and payment priority of the
servicing fee (the "MH Servicing Fee") it receives as compensation for servicing
the securitized manufactured housing portfolios (which, as explained above, is a
condition precedent for the transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase
Agreement), and (ii) restructuring the guarantees on the B-2 securities issued
in connection with securitizations of manufactured housing receivables. CFC has
not made any such guarantee payments due on or after November 15, 2002.

          On December 18, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order
granting the joint motion of CFC, Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. ("CFSC") and
U.S. Bank, as trustee for CFC's securitization trusts (the "Trustee"),
providing, for 30 business days, (i) for an increase of the MH Servicing Fee to
125 basis points per annum (the "Revised Servicing Fee") of the principal amount
outstanding of each manufactured housing securitization trust where the Trustee
acts as trustee; (ii) that the MH Servicing Fee be paid as an expense prior to
the distribution of any amounts in respect of certificates issued by each such
securitization trust; and (iii) for a senior security interest in CFC's
Manufactured Housing servicing platform and a junior security interest in CFC's
other assets in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of itself and the
corresponding certificateholders, to secure (a) the continued payment of certain
of the Trustee's fees and expenses; (b) the amount, if any, by which the Revised
Servicing Fee exceeds the original servicing fee at the contractual level of
priority during the period of the interim order; and (c) any losses to the
securitization trusts relating to manufactured housing, home equity and home
improvement loans, credit card receivables and recreational vehicle loans
resulting from any misappropriation, misapplication or other diversion of funds
by the servicer.

          A hearing seeking final resolution of the matters covered by this
joint motion was held on January 29, 2003. The Trustee, the Official Committee
of Unsecured Creditors of CFC and CFSC and the Ad Hoc Securitization Holders'
Committee in advance of the hearing filed objections or otherwise requested that
the hearing be continued to a later date to allow the relevant parties to reach
a consensual solution to the issues regarding the MH Servicing Fee. This hearing
has been rescheduled for February 12, 2003. See "Summary of Significant Motions
- Motion to Increase CFC's Manufactured Housing Securitization Servicing Fee."

          Overall, CFC intends to maximize the value obtainable from all
restructuring transactions it contemplates as part of its chapter 11 filing.
However, there can be no assurance that any transaction in connection therewith
will be completed, or if completed, that any proceeds resulting therefrom will
be available to satisfy any creditors other than creditors of CFC or parties
with a security interest in CFC's assets.

E.        PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

          The purpose of the Plan is to provide the Debtors with a capital
structure that can be supported by cash flows from operations. To that end, the
Plan will reduce CNC's debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations by more
than $5.0 billion and its future annual interest expense and distributions on
Trust Preferred Securities by approximately $380 million. The Debtors believe
that the reorganization contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of
their creditors and equity holders. If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors
believe that they will be forced to either file an alternate plan of
reorganization or liquidate under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In either
event, the Debtors believe that their creditors would realize a less favorable
distribution of value, or in certain cases, no value at all, for their claims
and equity interests. See the Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit A.

F.        THE BUSINESS OF REORGANIZED CNC

          As a result of our efforts to divest our finance operations, we expect
that upon emergence from bankruptcy, or soon thereafter, we will be engaged
exclusively in the insurance business. For a description of our insurance
operations, see "Description of Conseco's Business -- The Company's Business."

          Following confirmation of the Plan, Reorganized CNC intends to operate
two distinct and separate insurance businesses, Conseco Insurance Group ("CIG")
and Bankers Life and Casualty Company ("Bankers Life").

          CIG combines the unique strengths of several insurance companies that
serve over 3 million policyholders. CIG offers a complete portfolio of
supplemental health insurance (long term care, Medicare supplement, specified
disease and group disability), life, and annuity solutions in three of the
highest growth customer markets: senior citizens, the Hispanic community and
employer sponsored voluntary benefits programs. CIG intends to grow by expanding
its products and services, and its 20,000 independent agent distribution
network, as well as its 750 captive agent distribution network in these target
markets. Additionally, CIG is moving forward on a path to achieve a low cost,
high performance service platform through consolidation and simplification of
its processes.

          Bankers Life is a 120-year-old health, life and annuity company
primarily focused on the needs of middle income senior citizens, the fastest
growing market segment in the U.S. Bankers Life offers this market a
comprehensive insurance product portfolio including long term care, Medicare
supplement, senior life and fixed annuities. Bankers Life distributes its
products through an exclusive career agency sales force of more than 3,500
agents and sales managers. Bankers Life is committed to become the nation's
leading provider of financial security for seniors. Its growth strategy is based
on leveraging its two well known highly regarded brands (Bankers Life and
Colonial Penn), increasing the productivity and size of its well-established,
broad-based career distribution organization, leveraging its core product
offerings by building or insourcing additional senior market insurance and
non-insurance products, and implementing key strategic technologies to increase
efficiency and productivity.

          We also expect that by virtue of certain reorganization transactions
described below in the section entitled "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences to CNC - Transfer of Assets to Reorganized CNC," our corporate
structure will be simplified upon confirmation of the Plan. An organization
chart depicting the anticipated corporate structure of Reorganized CNC and its
subsidiaries as of the Confirmation Date is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

G.        TERMS OF NEW SECURITIES AND NEW BANK DEBT TO BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE
          PLAN

          On the Effective Date, Reorganized CNC will issue for distribution, in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan, (i) the New CNC Common Stock, (ii)
the New CNC Preferred Stock, (iii) the New CNC Warrants and (iv) the New Secured
Notes (collectively, the "New CNC Securities"). Reorganized CNC will also enter
into a new senior secured credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent,
and the other lenders party thereto (the "New Credit Facility"), on the
Effective Date. For purposes of determining the accrual of interest, dividends
or rights in respect of any other payment from and after the Effective

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

Date, the New CNC Securities and the New Credit Facility shall be deemed issued
as of the Effective Date regardless of the date on which they are actually
dated, authenticated or distributed; provided that the Reorganized CNC shall
withhold any actual payment until such distribution is made and no interest
shall accrue or otherwise be payable on any such withheld amounts.

          Summarized below are the material provisions of the New CNC Securities
and the New Credit Facility. This summary does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of Reorganized CNC, the New CNC Warrant Agreement, the
indenture governing the New Secured Notes (if any) and the credit agreement
governing the New Credit Facility. A term sheet more completely setting forth
the anticipated terms of the New Credit Facility is attached hereto as Exhibit
E. Any inconsistency between the following summary of the New Credit Facility
and the terms set forth in Exhibit E will be resolved in favor of the terms set
forth in Exhibit E. A term sheet more completely setting forth the anticipated
terms of the New CNC Preferred Stock and the New CNC Warrants is attached hereto
as Exhibit F. Any inconsistency between the following summaries of the New CNC
Preferred Stock and the New CNC Warrants and the terms set forth in Exhibit F
will be resolved in favor of the terms set forth in Exhibit F.

                              synthetic purchase agreements, (xiv) prohibition
                              on other agreements that restrict Reorganized
                              CNC's or its subsidiaries' ability to incur liens
                              or certain debt or pay dividends (other than
                              certain permitted exceptions), and (xv)
                              prohibition on swap or other hedging transactions,
                              other than in the ordinary course of business.


Events of Default:            The occurrence of a any event of default will
                              entitle the agent (or oblige the agent on the
                              instructions of an instructing group of lenders):
                              (a) to require the immediate repayment of all
                              amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facility,
                              and/or (b) to declare all such amounts due and
                              payable on demand and/or (c) to enforce or direct
                              the enforcement of the security. Such events of
                              default include: (i) failure to pay principal,
                              interest or fees, (ii) material breaches of
                              representations or warranties, (iii) breaches of
                              covenants, (iv) cross defaults to material
                              indebtedness of Reorganized CNC and its
                              subsidiaries, (v) bankruptcy or insolvency, (vi)
                              ERISA or judgment defaults above certain
                              thresholds, (vii) certain changes of control of
                              Reorganized CNC, (viii) occurrence of a material
                              adverse regulatory event with respect to a
                              Material Insurance Subsidiary (defined to include
                              the Active Material Insurance Subsidiaries and
                              other subsidiaries above a percentage to be agreed
                              upon of total statutory assets), (ix) inability of
                              any insurance subsidiary to make payments on
                              surplus notes, pays fees to affiliates or make
                              distributions to its stockholders as a result of
                              regulatory action, (x) invalidity or
                              unenforceability of guarantees, (xi) loss of lien
                              perfection or priority, (xii) downgrade by A.M.
                              Best on or after a Rating Testing Date (defined to
                              include each date when any portion of preferred
                              stock is disqualified as permanent equity or
                              Reorganized CNC takes a charge to write off any
                              goodwill, provided that in each case no event of
                              default will be deemed to have occurred until the
                              first date on which Reorganized CNC would not have
                              been in compliance with the debt to total
                              capitalization ratio or the minimum EBITDA
                              covenant).

Mandatory Prepayments:        Reorganized CNC is required to make prepayments
                              under the New Credit Facility with all or a
                              portion of the proceeds from the following
                              transactions or events: (i) incurrence of certain
                              indebtedness, (ii) issuance of equity interests by
                              Reorganized CNC or its subsidiaries, (iii) certain
                              asset sales by Reorganized CNC or its
                              subsidiaries, (iv) recovery of collateral by
                              Reorganized CNC or its subsidiaries securing
                              certain existing indebtedness, (v) repayments of
                              the D&O Facilities, and (vi) receipt of cash flows
                              above certain levels. The priority and order of
                              application of such prepayments will be as set
                              forth in the credit agreement governing the New
                              Credit Facility.

H.        EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF REORGANIZED CNC

          It is anticipated that the board of directors of Reorganized CNC will
consist of seven members, including two members from senior management and five
outside members selected by the Conseco Creditors Committee. The board of
directors of Reorganized CNC will appoint the board of directors of Reorganized
CIHC. In accordance with section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors
will file and serve a notice setting forth the officers and Directors of the
Reorganized Debtors no later than ten (10) calendar days before the Confirmation
Date. The Debtors will serve the notice upon: (i) the US Trustee, (ii) the Core
Group (as defined in the then current Case Management Procedures approved by the
Bankruptcy Court, and (iii) parties who have requested notice pursuant to Rule
2002 of the Bankruptcy Rules. Notice will be served in the manner set forth in
the then current Case Management Procedures.

I.        LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS

          Pursuant to section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code (sometimes
called the "Best Interests Test"), each Holder of an Impaired Claim or Impaired
Equity Interest must either (a) accept the Plan or (b) receive or retain under
the Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than
the value such Holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on the Effective Date. The first step in
meeting this test is to determine the proceeds that would be generated from the
hypothetical liquidation of the Debtors' assets and properties in the context of
a chapter 7 liquidation case. This "liquidation value" would consist primarily
of the proceeds from a forced sale of the Debtors' assets by a chapter 7
trustee. The gross amount of cash and cash equivalents ("Cash") available would
be the sum of the proceeds from the disposition of the Debtors' assets and the
Cash held by the Debtors at the time of the commencement of the chapter 7 case.
Such amount is reduced by the amount of any Claims secured by such assets, the
costs and expenses of the liquidation, and such additional administrative
expenses and priority claims that may result from the termination of the
Debtors' business and the use of chapter 7 for the purposes of a hypothetical
liquidation. Any remaining net Cash would be allocated to creditors and
stockholders in strict priority in accordance with section 726 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

          The Debtors believe that the Plan will produce a greater recovery for
Holders of Claims and Equity Interests than would be achieved in a chapter 7
liquidation. The Company has prepared a liquidation analysis (the "Liquidation
Analysis"), set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, to assist Holders of Claims
and Equity Interests to reach a determination as to whether to accept or reject
the Plan. This Liquidation Analysis estimates the proceeds to be realized if CNC
were to be liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This Liquidation
Analysis does not take into account CFC or include estimated proceeds, if any,
from a sale or liquidation of the Company's investment in CFC. The Liquidation
Analysis is based upon projected assets and liabilities of CNC as of June 1,
2003 and incorporates estimates and assumptions developed by CNC which are
subject to potentially material changes with respect to economic and business
conditions, as well as uncertainties not within its control.

          As noted above, the Company believes that under the Plan each holder
of Impaired Claims and Equity Interests will receive distributions with a value
not less than the value such holder would receive in a liquidation under chapter
7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This belief is based primarily upon (i) consideration
of the effects that a chapter 7 liquidation would have on the ultimate proceeds
available for distribution to creditors including, but not limited to, (a) the
increased costs and expenses of a liquidation under chapter 7 arising from fees
payable to a chapter 7 trustee and advisors to the trustee, (b) any erosion in
value of assets in a chapter 7 case in the context of the rapid liquidation
required under chapter 7 and the "forced sale" atmosphere that would prevail,
(c) any adverse effects on the Company's businesses as a result of the likely
departure of key employees, (d) any reduction of value associated with a chapter
7 trustee's operation of the Company's businesses, and (e) any substantial delay
in distributions to Holders in connection with a chapter 7 liquidation, and (ii)
the Liquidation Analysis. Holders of Impaired Claims and Interests should note
that the Liquidation Analysis does not reflect any delay in distributions to
creditors in a liquidation scenario, which, if considered, would only further
reduce the present value of any liquidation proceeds. Insurance regulatory
authorities have broad regulatory and supervisory powers over CNC's insurance
subsidiaries, including their operations and transactions with affiliates. This
regulation and supervision is primarily for the benefit and protection of
policyholders, and it includes the authority to take control of these assets if
deemed necessary to protect policyholders. In such an event, the existing
claimants of CNC may not receive any recovery on their Claims or Equity
Interests or may experience significant time delays in receiving a recovery.

          The Debtors believe that any liquidation analysis is speculative
because such an analysis is necessarily premised upon assumptions and estimates
that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many
of which would be beyond their control. Thus, there can be no assurance as to
values that would actually be realized or that a sale could, in fact, be
consummated in a chapter 7 liquidation, nor can there be any assurance that the
Bankruptcy Court would accept the conclusions set forth in the Liquidation
Analysis or concur with assumptions made therein for purposes of section
1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, the Liquidation Analysis
necessarily contains an

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

estimate of the amount of Claims that will ultimately become Allowed Claims.
This estimate is based solely upon the a review of the Company's books and
records and estimates as to additional Claims, if any, that may be filed in the
Chapter 11 Case(s) or that would arise in the event of a conversion of the
case(s) from chapter 11 to chapter 7. No order or finding has been entered by
the Bankruptcy Court fixing the amount of Claims at the projected amounts of
Allowed Claims set forth in the Liquidation Analysis. In preparing the
Liquidation Analysis, the Company has projected an amount of Allowed Claims that
is at the lower end of a range of reasonableness such that, for purposes of the
Liquidation Analysis, the largest possible liquidation dividend to holders of
Allowed Claims can be assessed. The estimate of the amount of Allowed Claims set
forth in the Liquidation Analysis should not be relied upon for any other
purpose, including, without limitation, any determination of the value of any
distribution to be made on account of Allowed Claims or Interests under the
Plan. The Liquidation Analysis is provided solely to disclose to holders the
effects of a hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation of CNC, subject to the
assumptions set forth therein.

          To the extent that confirmation of the Plan requires the establishment
of amounts for the chapter 7 liquidation value of CNC, funds available to pay
Claims, and the reorganization value of CNC, the Bankruptcy Court will determine
those amounts at the Confirmation Hearing. Accordingly, the annexed Liquidation
Analysis is provided solely to disclose to Holders the effects of a hypothetical
chapter 7 liquidation of CNC, subject to the assumptions set forth therein.

          The Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto does
not speculate as to the outcome of any potential causes of action the Debtors or
Holders of Claims may have nor does it, therefore, include any estimate of the
necessary expenses to litigate such claims.

J.        FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND VALUATION ANALYSIS

          In conjunction with the allocation of distributions under the Plan,
the Company determined that it was necessary to estimate post-confirmation
reorganization values of Reorganized CNC to provide for equitable distribution
among Holders of Allowed Claims and Equity Interests. Accordingly, the Company's
management developed a set of financial projections, summarized below and in
Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Projections"). The Company has also directed
Lazard to prepare a valuation analysis of Reorganized CNC. The Projections,
prepared by the Company's management as set forth in Exhibit B and the valuation
set forth below are based on a number of significant assumptions, including,
among other things, the successful reorganization of the Company, the successful
sale or liquidation of the Company's investment in CFC, an assumed Effective
Date of June 1, 2003, the Company's ability to achieve the operating and
financial results set forth in the Projections, the Company's ability to obtain
satisfactory ratings for its insurance subsidiaries from A.M. Best, and the
assumption that capital and equity market conditions remain consistent with
current conditions.

          THE PROJECTIONS ARE BASED UPON A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS.
ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS AND VALUES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PROJECTIONS.

          1. Financial Projections

          As a condition to confirmation of a plan, the Bankruptcy Code
requires, among other things, the Bankruptcy Court to determine that
confirmation is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further
reorganization of the debtor. In connection with the development of the Plan and
for purposes of determining whether the Plan satisfies this feasibility
standard, the Company's management, together with Lazard, has analyzed (taking
into account the Projections) the ability of Reorganized CNC to meet its
obligations under the Plan to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital
resources to conduct its business. The Projections were also prepared by the
Company's management to assist each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest in determining whether to accept or reject the Plan.

          The Projections should be read in conjunction with the assumptions,
qualifications and footnotes to tables containing the Projections set forth
herein and in Exhibit B, the historical consolidated financial information
(including the notes and schedules thereto) and the other information set forth
in Conseco's

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and
Conseco's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2002,
June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, the full texts of which are incorporated
herein by reference. The Projections were prepared in good faith based upon
estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Projections were
prepared by the Company's management in December 2002, and were based in part on
economic, competitive and general business conditions prevailing at that time.
Any future changes in these conditions may materially impact the ability of the
Company to achieve the Projections.

          THE PROJECTIONS WERE NOT PREPARED WITH A VIEW TOWARDS COMPLIANCE WITH
GUIDELINES FOR PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN
INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS. THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR HAS
NEITHER COMPILED NOR EXAMINED THE ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION
TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS THEREOF AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS NOT EXPRESSED AN
OPINION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT THERETO.

          THE COMPANY DOES NOT, AS A MATTER OF COURSE, PUBLISH ITS Projections.
ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER THE Debtors NOR REORGANIZED debtors INTEND TO, AND EACH
DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO, (I) FURNISH UPDATED PROJECTIONS TO HOLDERS OF
ALLOWED CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OR TO HOLDERS OF
NEW preferred stock, NEW COMMON STOCK or NEW CNC WARRANTS OR ANY OTHER PARTY
AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, (II) INCLUDE SUCH UPDATED INFORMATION IN ANY DOCUMENTS
THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR
(III) OTHERWISE MAKE SUCH UPDATED INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

          The projections provided in this disclosure statement and the exhibits
hereto have been prepared exclusively by the company's management. These
projections, while presented with numerical specificity, are necessarily based
on a variety of estimates and assumptions which, though considered reasonable by
management, may not be realized, and are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of
which are beyond the company's control. The company cautions that no
representations can be made as to the accuracy of these projections and related
information or as to the Company's ability to achieve the projected results.
Some assumptions may not materialize and events and circumstances occurring
subsequent to the date on which these projections were prepared may be different
from those assumed or may be unanticipated, and thus may affect financial
results in a material and possibly adverse manner. The projections and related
information, therefore, may not be relied upon as a guaranty or other assurance
of the actual results that will occur.

          Finally, the projections include assumptions as to the enterprise
value of reorganized CNC, the fair value of its assets and its liabilities as of
the effective date. reorganized cnc will be required to make such estimations as
of the effective date. Such determination will be based upon the fair values as
of that date, which could be materially greater or lower than the values assumed
in the estimates contained herein.

2.        Valuation Methodologies

          The value range for Reorganized CNC was estimated using certain
financial analyses including: Selected Comparable Companies Analysis and
Actuarial Analysis. In preparing the valuation of Reorganized CNC, Lazard
performed a variety of analyses and considered a variety of factors. The
Selected Comparable Companies Analysis, performed by Lazard, calculates certain
financial information, ratios and public market multiples relating to a group of
publicly traded companies engaged in businesses

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

generally similar to those conducted by the Company and compares them to certain
financial information and ratios relating to Reorganized CNC. The Actuarial
Analysis, which was developed by the Company's actuaries and outside consulting
actuaries, Milliman USA, derives a value based on the adjusted net worth and the
discounted projected future cash flows of Reorganized CNC's underlying insurance
businesses. The actuarial appraisal of the insurance company subsidiaries of
CNC, prepared by the Company's outside consulting actuaries, is available for
viewing at www.bmccorp.net. In order to fully comprehend this report, any user
of this report should be advised by an actuary with a substantial level of
expertise in areas relevant to this analysis to appreciate the significance of
the underlying assumptions and the impact of those assumptions on the
illustrated results. This report must be read in its entirety to be understood.

3.        Reorganization Value

          THE ESTIMATES OF THE REORGANIZATION VALUE PREPARED BY LAZARD REPRESENT
THE HYPOTHETICAL REORGANIZATION ENTERPRISE VALUE OF REORGANIZED CNC. SUCH
ESTIMATES REFLECT COMPUTATIONS OF THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATED REORGANIZATION
ENTERPRISE VALUE OF REORGANIZED CNC THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS VALUATION
TECHNIQUES AND DO NOT PURPORT TO REFLECT OR CONSTITUTE APPRAISALS, LIQUIDATION
VALUES OR ESTIMATES OF THE ACTUAL MARKET VALUE THAT MAY BE REALIZED THROUGH THE
SALE OF ANY SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE PLAN, WHICH MAY BE
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH HEREIN.

          The Company has been advised by Lazard, its financial advisor, with
respect to the reorganization value of Reorganized CNC on a going concern basis.
Solely for purposes of the Plan, the estimated range of enterprise value of
Reorganized CNC was assumed to be approximately $3,700 million to $3,900 million
(with a midpoint value of $3,800 million) as of an assumed Effective Date of
June 1, 2003. After deducting from Reorganized CNC's enterprise value the
assumed long-term indebtedness of Reorganized CNC at the assumed Effective Date,
consisting of $1,388 million of new long-term indebtedness, the estimated range
of total equity value of Reorganized CNC was assumed to be approximately $2,312
million to $2,512 million (with a midpoint value of $2,412 million). After
deducting from Reorganized CNC's total equity value the assumed value of the New
CNC Preferred Stock at the assumed Effective Date of $808 million (which amount
gives effect to accrued interest on the Senior Credit Facility and the 1999 D&O
Facility through the assumed Effective Date that would be satisfied in the form
of New CNC Preferred Stock), the estimated range of common equity value of
Reorganized CNC was assumed to be approximately $1,504 million to $1,704 million
(with a midpoint value of $1,604 million). This analysis assumes that the
approximately $88 million of Secured Note Claims will be reinstated as long-term
indebtedness; in the event that the Secured Notes receive equity in satisfaction
of their claims versus debt, the assumed equity value ranges assumed herein
would increase accordingly. This analysis also does not take into account the
Company's investment in CFC, which the Company intends to sell or liquidate, or
include estimated proceeds, if any, from such sale or liquidation. Additionally,
this analysis does not take into account the value of the New CNC Warrants that
are to be issued under the Plan.

          The assumed range of the reorganization value as of an assumed
Effective Date of June 1, 2003, reflects work performed by Lazard on the basis
of information with respect to the business and certain assets and liabilities
of Reorganized CNC available to Lazard as of December 2002. Lazard does not have
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its analysis or its estimated total
enterprise value for Reorganized CNC.

          Lazard's analyses did not address any other aspect of the proposed
restructuring or any related transactions or constitute a recommendation to any
holder of outstanding securities of the Debtors as to how such security holder
should vote or act on any matter relating to the restructuring or any related
transaction. In addition, neither Lazard's valuation analysis nor its estimated
total enterprise value for Reorganized CNC constitute an opinion as to the
fairness to holders of outstanding securities of the Debtors from a financial
point of view of the consideration to be received by such security holders
pursuant to the Plan.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

          In preparing its analyses, Lazard, among other things: (i) reviewed
certain historical financial information of the Company for the recent years and
interim periods; (ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating data of
the Company including financial projections prepared and provided by the
Company's management relating to its business and its prospects; (iii) met with
certain members of senior management of the Company to discuss the Company's
operations and future prospects; (iv) reviewed certain publicly available
financial data and considered the market value of certain public companies
believed to be generally comparable to Reorganized CNC in one or more respects;
(v) considered certain economic and industry information relevant to the
operating business; and (vi) reviewed such other information and conducted such
other studies, analyses, inquiries, and investigations as Lazard deemed
appropriate. Although Lazard conducted a review and analysis of the Company's
business, operating assets and liabilities and Reorganized CNC's business plans,
it assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all: (i) financial and
other information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Company, including
without limitation, information provided by the Company's actuaries and outside
consulting actuaries; and (ii) publicly available information. In addition,
Lazard assumed and relied upon the reasonableness and accuracy of management's
projections, and no independent valuations or appraisals of the Company were
sought or obtained in connection herewith. In addition, Lazard is not an actuary
and Lazard's services and analyses referenced herein do not constitute actuarial
determinations or evaluations or any evaluation of actuarial assumptions. In
addition, and not withstanding the foregoing, the Company's outside consulting
actuaries would only provide its materials to Lazard on the condition that
Lazard agree not to rely upon them in a manner that created a legal duty from
the outside consulting actuaries to Lazard or bring any claim against the
outside consulting actuaries. As a result, there can be no assurance with
respect to any actuarial information or information derived therefrom.

          The value of an operating business is subject to numerous
uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult to predict, and will
fluctuate with changes in factors affecting the financial condition and
prospects of such a business. As a result, the estimate of the range of the
reorganization enterprise value of Reorganized CNC set forth herein is not
necessarily indicative of actual outcomes, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those set forth herein. Since such estimates are inherently
subject to uncertainties, neither the Company, Lazard, nor any other person
assumes responsibility for their accuracy. In addition, the valuation of
newly-issued securities is subject to additional uncertainties and
contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict. Reorganized CNC intends to
apply to list the New CNC Preferred Stock, the New CNC Common Stock and the New
CNC Warrants on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. There can be no
assurance, however, that these securities will be so listed and, if so listed,
that an active trading market would develop. Actual market prices of these
securities at issuance will depend upon, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, conditions in the financial markets, the anticipated initial securities
holdings of prepetition creditors, some of which may prefer to liquidate their
investment rather than hold it on a long-term basis, and other factors which
generally influence the prices of securities.



                                      III.
        INTERCOMPANY RELATIONSHIPS AND PROPOSED TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY
                             CLAIMS UNDER THE PLAN

          The Debtors have a number of intercompany arrangements and
relationships, including the following:

A.        SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS

          Conseco Services, LLC, an affiliate of the Reorganizing Debtors
("Conseco Services"), provides the Reorganizing Debtors with administrative
services under various service agreements (the "Service Agreements"). Pursuant
to the Service Agreements, Conseco Services provides the Reorganizing Debtors
with administrative services needed for the conduct of the Debtors' businesses
and incurs expenses and costs associated therewith, including, among others,
salaries, bonuses, payroll and other taxes, employee benefits, reimbursements,
consulting and professional fees, vendor payments and insurance premiums. The
Reorganizing Debtors pay Conseco Services an amount equal to such costs and
expenses plus a 10%

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

service fee. The Reorganizing Debtors advance Conseco Services approximately $2
million per month in the aggregate under the Service Agreements. Conseco
Services provides certain benefits to employees of the Liquidating Debtors and
services to the Liquidating Debtors. Any claims between Conseco Services and the
Liquidating Debtors would be resolved under the setoff provision of the Plan.

B.        Intercompany Obligations

          Unless otherwise indicated, all intercompany amounts owed by the
Debtors to other Debtors or non-Debtors in respect of loans, notes, and
intercompany cash transfers will be cancelled under the Plan. The intercompany
claims that will be reinstated under the Plan are set forth on Exhibit L
attached hereto. See "The Plan of Reorganization - Classification and Treatment
of Claims and Equity Interests."

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries and CCM must maintain minimum
capitalization levels under various regulatory requirements. Accordingly,
certain intercompany amounts owing to the insurance subsidiaries and CCM by the
Debtors will not be cancelled. The intercompany claims that will be cancelled
under the Plan are set forth on Exhibit K attached hereto. Specifically, the
Debtors will not cancel the intercompany amounts they owe to the following
entities:

          1. Conseco Capital Management

          CCM is the primary manager of the assets and investments of CNC's
insurance subsidiaries. As such, it is critical that CCM continue to qualify as
a "qualified professional asset manager" (a "QPAM") under U.S. Department of
Labor's Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14, which allows CCM to engage
in transactions on account of its benefit plan clients that would otherwise be
prohibited by ERISA. One requirement of such exemption is that CCM must either
(i) have in excess of $750,000 in shareholders or partners equity as of the last
day of its most recent fiscal year or (ii) have all of its obligations
unconditionally guaranteed by an affiliate that has in excess of $750,000 in
shareholders or partners equity as of the last day of its most recent fiscal
year.

          As of December 31, 2002, CNC owed approximately $20.8 million to CCM
on account of cash previously distributed from CCM to CNC (the "CCM
Receivable"), net of amounts payable to CNC pursuant to a tax sharing agreement.
The CCM Receivable is valued as an asset on the balance sheet of CCM. Without
the CCM Receivable, CCM would have shareholder's equity of approximately $1.2
million. Accordingly, the CCM Receivable will be reinstated as an obligation of
CNC in order to ensure CCM's continued compliance with QPAM restrictions and
requirements.

          2. The Insurance Subsidiaries

          CNC and CIHC owe intercompany obligations to five insurance company
subsidiaries: Conseco Life Insurance Company ("Conseco Life"), Conseco Annuity
Assurance Company ("Conseco Annuity"), Bankers Life, Bankers National Life
Insurance Company ("Bankers National") and Washington National Insurance Company
("Washington National") (collectively, the "Insurance Subsidiaries").

          As described in the Section entitled "General Information -
Description of Conseco's Business - Government Regulation," insurance companies
are subject to extensive regulation. CNC and CIHC have issued the Insurance
Subsidiaries several series of preferred stock, some of which positively affects
the Insurance Subsidiaries' RBC ratios and capitalization.

          CNC has issued $900 million principal amount Series E Preferred Stock
to Bankers National. Because the Series E Preferred Stock is not listed as an
admitted asset on the statutory balance sheet of Bankers National, this stock
will be cancelled under the Plan.

          CIHC has issued three series of preferred stock to the Insurance
Subsidiaries: (i) the 1994 Series Preferred Stock, held by Bankers Life, Conseco
Annuity and Conseco Life; (ii) the 1998 Series Preferred Stock, held by Bankers
Life, Conseco Life, and Washington National; and (iii) the $2.32 Preferred
Stock, held by Conseco Life. The foregoing series of preferred stock are
collectively referred to herein as the "Regulated CIHC Preferred Stock". The
Regulated CIHC Preferred Stock constitutes admitted assets on

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

the statutory balance sheets of each Insurance Subsidiary holding such stock.
Accordingly, this stock together with any accrued and unpaid dividends in
respect of this stock, will be reinstated under the Plan with the same admitted
values as existed immediately prior to the Petition Date.

C.        SETOFF BETWEEN LIQUIDATING DEBTORS AND REORGANIZING DEBTORS

          As of the Petition Date, CFC owed CIHC $277,376,671 (the "CFC/CIHC
Intercompany Note"), and CIHC owed CFC $315,030,986 (the "CIHC/CFC Intercompany
Note").

          Except as expressly provided for herein, each Reorganizing Debtor and
Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code or applicable non-bankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant hereto on
account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is
made on account of such Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor as the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests,
rights or Causes of Action against such Holder have not been compromised or
settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise); provided that, neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims,
Equity Interests, rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distribution contemplated by this Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note shall be offset against (i) the CFC/CIHC Intercompany
Note, (ii) all other prepetition amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all postpetition
amounts owed by CFC that are not repaid in full in Cash by CFC, including,
without limitation, health and welfare benefits, insurance, other direct CFC
expenses and an appropriate allocation of the postpetition professional fees
paid by CIHC. Any balance of the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note remaining after
giving effect to all the setoffs in the preceding sentence will be Class 6B
Claims.

          In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Liquidating
Debtors all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Liquidating Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts owing under the
prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) amounts owing as a result of payments
made on behalf of the Liquidating Debtors to ExlServices.com, Inc. ("Exl"),
(iii) an appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees incurred by the
Debtors in connection with restructuring of the Debtors and the preparation for
these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv) prepetition amounts owing by the Liquidating
Debtors to Conseco Services, LLC or CIHC, and (y) postpetition amounts owing by
the Liquidating Debtors to the Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full
in Cash, including without limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments
owed by the Liquidating Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the
postpetition professional fees incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors during these
Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) any postpetition payments by the Reorganizing Debtors to
Exl pursuant to the guarantee by CNC of a transition services agreement between
Exl and CFC, and (iv) postpetition amounts owed by the Liquidating Debtors to
Conseco Services or CIHC.

                                      IV.
                 SUMMARY OF OTHER DEBTORS AND REASONS FOR FILING

          In addition to CNC and CIHC, certain of their affiliates filed for
chapter 11 on the Petition Date. CTIHC, Inc. and Partners Health Group, Inc.
filed for chapter 11 to address certain liabilities against them. In addition,
CFC and Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. ("CFSC") also filed chapter 11
petitions. CFC and CFSC filed for chapter 11 to (i) facilitate the sale of
substantially all of their assets and (ii) liquidate any remaining assets, in
each case under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court.

                              THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

          On December 17, 2002 (the "Petition Date"), the Debtors filed
voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. At such
time, all actions and proceedings against the Debtors and all acts to obtain
property from the Debtors were stayed under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Debtors will continue to conduct their businesses and manage their
properties as debtors in possession pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

A.        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT MOTIONS

          The following summarizes significant motions that have been filed in
the Chapter 11 Cases. You can view these motions at www.bmccorp.net/conseco.

          1.   Applications for Retention of Debtors' Professionals

          On January 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors'
request to retain certain professionals to represent and assist them in
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. These professionals were intimately
involved with the negotiation and development of the Plan. These professionals
include, among others: (a) Kirkland & Ellis, as counsel for the Debtors, (b)
Lazard Freres & Co., LLC as financial advisor for the Debtors, (c) Bankruptcy
Management Corporation, as notice agent for the Debtors and (d) Bridge
Associates, LLC as crisis managers for the Liquidating Debtors. The Bankruptcy
Court also approved the Debtors' request to retain other professionals to assist
them in other ongoing matters. These professionals include, but are not limited
to: (i) Baker Botts, LLC as special SEC counsel to the Debtors; (ii)
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as accountants to the Debtors; (iii) Gregory P.
Joseph Law Offices, LLC as special litigation counsel to the Debtors; (iv)
Milliman USA Inc. to provide actuarial and valuation services to the
Reorganizing Debtors, (v) Baker & Daniels, as special corporate counsel to the
Reorganizing Debtors and (vi) Dorsey & Whitney LLP, as special corporate and
securitization counsel to the Liquidating Debtors.

          2.   Motions to Approve Manner of Notice of the Disclosure Statement
               and Confirmation Hearing, and to Schedule Disclosure Statement
               Hearing and Confirmation Hearing

          The Bankruptcy Court scheduled a hearing on this Disclosure Statement
for March 5, 2003 at 2:00 p.m. (prevailing central time). In addition, the
Bankruptcy Court scheduled a Confirmation Hearing on the Plan for _________,
2003. On January 31, 2003, the Debtors filed a motion to establish solicitation
procedures, which will be heard on March 5, 2003.

          3.   Motion to Continue Using Existing Bank Accounts and Business
               Forms

          The Bankruptcy Court has authorized the Debtors' continued use of
their respective bank accounts. Additionally, the Reorganizing Debtors have
historically received services from their subsidiary Conseco Services pursuant
to the Service Agreements. Pursuant to the Service Agreements, Conseco Services
provides the Reorganizing Debtors with administrative services needed for the
conduct of the Reorganizing Debtors' businesses and incurs expenses and costs
including salaries, bonuses, payroll and other taxes, employee benefits,
reimbursements, consulting and professional fees, vendor payments and insurance
premiums. The Reorganizing Debtors pay Conseco Services an amount equal to such
costs and expenses plus a 10% service fee. The Bankruptcy Court has authorized
the Reorganizing Debtors to continue using Conseco Services in this manner.

          4.   Motion to Pay Employee Wages and Associated Benefits

          The Debtors believe that their employees are a valuable asset and that
any delay in paying prepetition or postpetition compensation or benefits to
their employees would destroy the Debtors' relationship with employees and
irreparably harm employee morale at a time when the dedication, confidence and
cooperation of the Debtors' employees is most critical. The Bankruptcy Court
granted the

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

Reorganizing Debtors' request for authority to pay all compensation and benefits
owed to employees through Conseco Services. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court
granted the Liquidating Debtors' request for authority to pay all compensation
and benefits to their employees. The authority granted allows the Debtors to
compensate their employees for obligations payable as of the Petition Date, as
well as obligations that come due after the Petition Date.

          5.   Motion to Increase CFC's Manufactured Housing Securitization
               Servicing Fee

          The Debtors filed this motion jointly with U.S. Bank, as trustee
("Trustee") for certain manufactured housing securitization trusts (the "MH
Securitization Trusts"), on the Petition Date. The joint motion requested the
Bankruptcy Court to order a temporary increase, for a period of thirty (30)
business days, in the amount of the monthly servicing fee paid to CFC or CFSC as
servicers of the MH Securitization Trusts to 1/12 of 125 basis points per annum
and the priority of such payments (the "Revised Servicing Fee") as an expense
prior to the distribution of any amounts in respect of certificates issued by
the MH Securitization Trusts.

          Pursuant to the joint motion, CFC and CFSC have granted a senior
security interest in CFC's Manufactured Housing platform and a junior security
interest in CFC's other assets in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of itself
and the corresponding certificateholders, to secure (i) the continued payment of
certain of the Trustee's fees and expenses; (ii) the amount, if any, by which
the Revised Servicing Fee exceeds the original servicing fee at the contractual
level of priority during the period of the requested interim order; and (iii)
any losses to the securitization trusts relating to manufactured housing, home
equity and home improvement loans, credit card receivables and recreational
vehicle loans resulting from any misappropriation, misapplication or other
diversion of funds by the servicer.

          The Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order granting the requested
relief, with the final hearing scheduled for February 12, 2003.

          6.   Motions for Authority to Continue the Key Employee Retention
               Program

          The Debtors believe that it is imperative to stabilize their workforce
at this critical juncture of the Chapter 11 Cases to ensure that the necessary
complement of employees required to proceed with the Debtors' reorganization are
in place. On January 14, 2003 (with respect to the Liquidating Debtors and on
January 29, 2003 (with respect to the Reorganizing Debtors), the Bankruptcy
Court granted the Debtors' request for authority to continue, and approved the
terms of, an enhanced key employee retention program. In addition, on or about
January 31, 2003, the Reorganizing Debtors filed a motion to implement a key
employee retention program for their senior management (the "Senior Management
KERP"). The Senior Management KERP requests authority for the Reorganizing
Debtors to implement a key employee retention program for certain senior
management that has two components: (i) an annual incentive bonus and (ii)
severance.

          7.   Motion for Authority to Prohibit Trading of Equity Securities

          The Reorganizing Debtors filed this motion on the Petition Date,
requesting the Bankruptcy Court institute procedures to prohibit, without the
consent of the Reorganizing Debtors or the Bankruptcy Court, sales and other
transfers of equity securities of CNC by holders of the outstanding CNC common
stock on a fully diluted basis (a "Substantial Equityholder"), to prohibit,
without the consent of the Reorganizing Debtors or the Bankruptcy Court, the
acquisition of CNC equity securities by Substantial Equityholders or by persons
who would become a Substantial Equityholder as a result of that acquisition, and
to impose certain notification requirements on persons who are or become
Substantial Equityholders. The Reorganizing Debtors requested this relief in
order to guard against an unplanned change in control for purposes of section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could limit the Reorganizing Debtors'
ability to use net operating losses in the future. Such equity interest trading
could also adversely impact the Reorganizing Debtors by resulting in inadvertent
"changes in control" under state insurance regulations. The Bankruptcy Court
granted this motion and entered an amended final order on January 21, 2003.

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

          8.   Bar Date Order

          The Bankruptcy Court set a claims bar date of February 21, 2003 for
all creditors holding Claims against the Reorganizing Debtors. The Bankruptcy
Court also set June 17, 2003 as the bar date for governmental entities. If
creditors and governmental entities do not file any claims by the bar date, they
will be barred from asserting any claims against the Reorganizing Debtors or
receiving distributions under the Plan.

          9.   Schedules and Statements

          The Reorganizing Debtors filed their respective schedules of assets
and liabilities and statement of financial affairs (the "Schedules") with the
Bankruptcy Court. The Schedules can be reviewed at the office of the Clerk of
the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Everett McKinley
Dirksen Building, 219 S. Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60604, or can be obtained
on the website www.bmccorp.net/conseco. The Liquidating Debtors will file their
respective schedules of assets and liabilities and statement of financial
affairs no later than February 3, 2003.

          10.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction Extending the Automatic Stay to
               Certain Directors and Officers

          Conseco, Inc. v. Carolyn Porter, et al. In this adversary action, CNC
is seeking an injunction barring plaintiffs in nine actions from pursuing claims
against certain current and former directors and officers of CNC, as well as its
non-debtor subsidiary, Conseco Services. On January 6, 2003, the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order staying all nine actions until April 6, 2003. The court
ruled that the automatic stay would not bar the plaintiffs in several of the
actions from perfecting the consolidation of those actions and selecting lead
counsel and a lead plaintiff. The action has been continued until the next
omnibus hearing after April 2, 2003. The stay in this action also has been
applied by stipulation to Roderick Russell, et al. v. Conseco, Inc., et al., an
adversary action involving claims against CNC, certain current and former
directors and officers of CNC, and Conseco Services.

          Conseco, Inc. v. Royal Insurance Company, et al. In this adversary
action, CNC is seeking a declaration that an action pending in Indiana state
court is subject to the automatic stay, as well as an injunction barring further
proceedings in that action. CNC's motion for a preliminary injunction was set
for hearing on January 6, 2003, but was carried over until January 14, 2003 at
11:00 a.m. On January 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the parties to
engage in additional briefing and suggested a ruling would be forthcoming.

          11.  Estimation Procedures

          On February 19, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court will hear the Reorganizing
Debtors' request for an order instituting procedures whereby claims against the
Reorganizing Debtors (other than claims relating to securities or shareholder
derivative litigation) may be estimated. Estimation of disputed claims is
required in order to establish appropriate reserves under the Plan.

B.        APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES

          On January 3, 2003, the Office of the United States Trustee appointed
three official committees in the Chapter 11 Cases (collectively, the "Official
Committees"): (i) Official Committee of the Reorganizing Debtors (the "Conseco
Creditors Committee"); (ii) Official Committee of the Liquidating Debtors (the
"CFC Creditors Committee") and (iii) Official Committee of the Trust Preferred
Securities (the "TOPrS Creditors Committee").

          The members of the Conseco Creditors Committee are The Bank of New
York, Bank of America, N.A., Angelo, Gordon & Co., L.P., Appaloosa Mgmt., L.P.,
HSBC Bank USA, Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC and First Pacific
Advisors, Inc. The Conseco Creditors Committee retained Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver & Jacobson and Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw as its legal advisors and
Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin LLP and Greenhill & Co, LLC as its financial
advisors.

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

          The members of the CFC Creditors Committee are U.S. Bank National
Association, Millenium Partners, L.P., Prudential Insurance Company,
Commonwealth Advisors, Inc., Deutsche Asset Management, Jefferson Pilot
Financial Insurance Company and Morgan Keegan. The CFC Creditors Committee
retained Becker & Poliakoff and Greenberg Traurig as its legal advisors and
Huron Consulting Group LLC as its financial advisors.

          The members of the TOPrS Creditors Committee are Paul Floto, United
Capital Markets, Inc. and Oppenheimer Capital. The TOPrS Creditors Committee
retained Saul Ewing LLP and Jenner & Block as its legal advisors and Raymond
James as its financial advisors.

          Since the formation of the Official Committees, the Debtors have
consulted with the Official Committees concerning the administration of the
Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors have kept the Official Committees informed about
the Debtors' operations and have sought the concurrence of the Official
Committees to the extent their respective constituencies would be affected by
actions and transactions taken outside of the ordinary course of the Debtors'
businesses. The Official Committees have participated actively, together with
the Debtors' management and professionals, in among other things, reviewing the
Debtors' business plan and operations. The Debtors and their respective
professionals have met with the Official Committees and their respective
professionals on numerous occasions in connection with the negotiation of the
Plan.

                                      VI.
             [COURT-APPROVED] SUMMARY OF THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

A.        OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 11

          Chapter 11 is the principal business reorganization chapter of the
Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is authorized
to reorganize its business for the benefit of itself, its creditors and interest
holders. Another goal of chapter 11 is to promote equality of treatment for
similarly situated creditors and similarly situated interest holders with
respect to the distribution of a debtor's assets.

          The commencement of a chapter 11 case creates an estate that is
comprised of all of the legal and equitable interests of the debtor as of the
filing date. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the debtor may continue to
operate its business and remain in possession of its property as a
"debtor-in-possession."

          The consummation of a plan of reorganization is the principal
objective of a chapter 11 case. A plan of reorganization sets forth the means
for satisfying claims against and interests in a debtor. Confirmation of a plan
of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court makes the plan binding upon the
debtor, any issuer of securities under the plan, any person or entity acquiring
property under the plan and any creditor of or equity holder in the debtor,
whether or not such creditor or equity holder (a) is impaired under or has
accepted the plan or (b) receives or retains any property under the plan.
Subject to certain limited exceptions and other than as provided in the plan
itself or the confirmation order, the confirmation order discharges the debtor
from any debt that arose prior to the date of confirmation of the plan and
substitutes therefor the obligations specified under the confirmed plan.

          A chapter 11 plan may specify that the legal, contractual and
equitable right of the holders of claim or interests in classes are to remain
unaltered by the reorganization effectuated by the plan. Such classes are
referred to as "unimpaired" and, because of such favorable treatment, are deemed
to accept the plan. Accordingly, it is not necessary to solicit votes from the
holders of claims or equity interests in such classes. A chapter 11 plan also
may specify that certain classes will not receive any distribution of property
or retain any claim against a debtor. Such classes are deemed not to accept the
plan and, therefore, need not be solicited to vote to accept or reject the plan.
Any classes that are receiving a distribution of property under the plan but are
not "unimpaired" will be solicited to vote to accept or reject the plan.

          Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan of
reorganization shall classify the claims of a debtor's creditors and equity
interest holders. In compliance therewith, the Plan divides Claims and Equity
Interests into various Classes and sets forth the treatment for each Class. The
Debtors also are

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

required, as discussed above, under section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code, to
classify Claims and Equity Interests into Classes that contain Claims and Equity
Interests that are substantially similar to the other Claims and Equity
Interests in such Classes. The Debtors believe that the Plan has classified all
Claims and Equity Interests in compliance with the provisions of section 1122 of
the Bankruptcy Code, but it is possible that a Holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest may challenge the classification of Claims and Equity Interests and
that the Bankruptcy Court may find that a different classification is required
for the Plan to be confirmed. In such event, the Debtors intend, to the extent
permitted by the Bankruptcy Court and the Plan, to make such reasonable
modifications of the classifications under the Plan to permit confirmation and
to use the Plan acceptances received in this solicitation for the purpose of
obtaining the approval of the reconstituted Class or Classes of which the
accepting Holder is ultimately deemed to be a member. Any such reclassification
could adversely affect the Class in which such Holder was initially a member, or
any other Class under the Plan, by changing the composition of such Class and
the vote required of that Class for approval of the Plan.

          The Debtors (and each of their respective Affiliates, agents,
directors, officers, employees, advisors and attorneys), the Unofficial
Noteholders' Committee, the Unofficial Lenders' Committee, and the Official
Committees, and each of the members of such committees (and each of their
respective Affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees, advisors, and
attorneys) have, and upon confirmation of the Plan will be deemed to have,
participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code with regard to the distributions of the securities under the
Plan, and therefore are not, and on account of such distributions will not be,
liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation
governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or such
distributions made pursuant to the Plan.

THE REMAINDER OF THIS SECTION PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURE AND MEANS FOR
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND THE CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND
EQUITY INTERESTS UNDER THE PLAN, AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO THE PLAN (AS WELL AS THE EXHIBITS THERETO AND DEFINITIONS THEREIN)

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT INCLUDE SUMMARIES OF THE
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PLAN AND IN THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN. THE
STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT DO NOT PURPORT TO BE PRECISE
OR COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF ALL THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN OR DOCUMENTS

THE FULL AND COMPLETE STATEMENT OF SUCH TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN OR
DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN, AND REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE PLAN AND TO SUCH
DOCUMENTS FOR THE FULL AND COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF SUCH TERMS AND PROVISIONS.

THE PLAN ITSELF AND THE DOCUMENTS THEREIN CONTROL THE ACTUAL TREATMENT OF CLAIMS
AGAINST AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS UNDER THE PLAN AND WILL, UPON THE
OCCURRENCE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE, BE BINDING UPON ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AGAINST
AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS, THE DEBTORS' ESTATES, THE REORGANIZED
DEBTORS, ALL PARTIES RECEIVING PROPERTY UNDER THE PLAN, AND OTHER PARTIES IN
INTEREST. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, ON THE
ONE HAND, AND THE PLAN OR ANY OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
TERMS OF THE PLAN AND/OR SUCH OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT SHALL CONTROL.

</TABLE>

          The Debtors believe that the Plan provides the best and most prompt
possible recovery to Holders of Claims and Equity Interests. Under the Plan,
Claims against and Equity Interests in the Debtors are divided into different
classes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, claims and equity interests are classified
beyond mere "creditors" or "shareholders" because such entities may hold claims
or equity interests in more than one class. For purposes of this Disclosure
Statement, the term Holder refers to the holder of a Claim or Equity Interest in
a particular Class under the Plan. If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court and consummated, on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Debtors will make distributions in respect of certain Classes of
Claims and Equity Interests as provided in the Plan. The Classes of Claims
against and Equity Interests in the Debtors created under the Plan, the
treatment of those Classes under the Plan and distributions to be made under the
Plan are described below.

C.        SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION

          The estates of the Debtors have not been substantively consolidated.
The Claims held solely against one of the Debtors will be satisfied solely from
the cash and assets of such Debtor except as provided in the Plan. Except as
specifically set forth herein, nothing in the Plan or the Disclosure Statement
shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an admission that one of the Debtors
is subject to or liable for any Claim against any other Debtor. Except as
provided in the Plan, the Claims of Creditors that hold Claims against multiple
Debtors will be treated as separate Claims with respect to each Debtor's estate
for all purposes (including, but not limited to, distributions and voting), and
such Claims will be administered as provided in the Plan. Any Claims against the
Debtors will be satisfied according to the terms of the Plan.

D.        SEVERABILITY OF PLAN PROVISIONS

          The Plan is comprised of a number of Subplans of reorganization, one
for each Reorganizing Debtor and one for each Liquidating Debtor. The
confirmation requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code must be
satisfied separately with respect to each Subplan. If any Subplan(s) is not
confirmed, then the Debtors reserve the right, with the prior written consent of
the Official Unsecured Committee, to either (a) request that the other Subplans
be confirmed or (b) withdraw some or all Subplans; provided that (i) the Subplan
for CIHC may not be confirmed unless the Subplan for CNC is confirmed and (ii)
the Subplan for CNC may not be confirmed unless the Subplan for CIHC is
confirmed. Subject to the preceding provision, the Debtors' inability to confirm
or election to withdraw any Subplan(s) shall not impair the confirmation of any
other Subplan(s).

E.        CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS

          1.   Summary of Claims against all Debtors

               (a)  Administrative Claims

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

          Administrative Claims are Claims for costs and expenses of
administration of the Chapter 11 Cases that are entitled to priority pursuant to
section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Such Claims include (1) any actual and
necessary costs and expenses incurred after the Petition Date of preserving the
Debtors' estates and operating the businesses of the Debtors (such as wages,
salaries, commissions for services, leased equipment and premises), and Claims
of governmental units for taxes (including tax audit Claims related to tax years
commencing after the Petition Date, but excluding Claims relating to tax
periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Petition Date) and (2) all
fees and charges assessed against the Debtors' Estates under Section 1930,
Chapter 123 of Title 28, United States Code.

          Subject to sections 328, 330(a) and 331 of the Bankruptcy Code, each
Holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim will be paid the full unpaid amount of
such Allowed Administrative Claim in Cash (i) on the Effective Date or as soon
thereafter as is practicable, (ii) or if such Administrative Claim is Allowed
after the Effective Date, on the date such Administrative Claim is Allowed, or
as soon thereafter as is practicable, or (iii) upon such other terms as may be
agreed upon by such Holder and the respective Reorganized Debtor or otherwise
upon an order of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that Allowed Administrative
Claims representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business or
otherwise assumed by the Debtors pursuant to the Plan will be assumed on the
Effective Date and paid or performed by the respective Reorganized Debtor when
due in accordance with the terms and conditions of the particular agreements
governing such obligations. The Reorganizing Debtors (and the Reorganized
Debtors) are not obliged to pay Administrative Claims on behalf of any
Liquidating Debtors.

               (b)  Priority Tax Claims

          Priority Tax Claims are Claims for taxes entitled to priority in
payment under sections 502(i) and 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code. On the
Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Holder of an Allowed
Priority Tax Claim due and payable on or prior to the Effective Date shall be
paid, at the option of the respective Debtor, (a) Cash in an amount equal to the
amount of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim, or (b) Cash over a six-year period
from the date of assessment as provided in section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the
Bankruptcy Code, with interest payable at a rate of [__%] per annum or such
other rate as may be required by the Bankruptcy Code. The amount of any Priority
Tax Claim that is not an Allowed Claim or that is not otherwise due and payable
on or prior to the Effective Date, and the rights of the Holder of such Claim,
if any, to payment in respect thereof shall (x) be determined in the manner in
which the amount of such Claim and the rights of the Holder of such Claim would
have been resolved or adjudicated if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been
commenced, (y) survive the Effective Date and Consummation of the Plan as if the
Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced, and (z) not be discharged pursuant to
section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code. Reorganizing Debtors (and the Reorganized
Debtors) are not obliged to pay Priority Tax Claims Allowed against any
Liquidating Debtor.

          2.   Summary of the Claims and Equity Interests against the
               Reorganizing Debtors

          The categories of Claims and Equity Interests listed below classify
Claims and Equity Interests for all purposes, including voting, confirmation and
distribution pursuant hereto and pursuant to sections 1122 and 1123(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code. A Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed classified in a
particular Class only to the extent that the Claim or Equity Interest qualifies
within the description of that Class and shall be deemed classified in a
different Class to the extent that any remainder of such Claim or Equity
Interest qualifies within the description of such different Class. A Claim or
Equity Interest is in a particular Class only to the extent that such Claim or
Equity Interest is Allowed in that Class and has not been paid or otherwise
settled prior to the Effective Date. Any default with respect to any Allowed
Claim that existed immediately prior to the Petition Date shall be deemed cured
upon the Effective Date.

</TABLE>


               (i) Class 1A--Other Priority Claims (Unimpaired)

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder
of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and CNC, each Holder of an Allowed Class 1A
Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed Class 1A
Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CNC:

               (a)  The Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1A Claim
                    in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter
                    as is practicable; provided that, Class 1A Claims
                    representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
                    business will be paid in full in Cash when such Class 1A
                    Claims become due and owing in the ordinary course of
                    business; or

               (b)  The Distribution Agent will treat such Claim in any other
                    manner so that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered
                    Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 1A is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, Holders of Class 1A Claims are not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii) Class 2A--Other Secured Claims (Unimpaired)

                                      -45-
<PAGE>


               (b) Other CNC Secured Claims are Claims that are secured by a
lien on property in which CNC has an interest, or that is subject to setoff
under section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent of the value of the
Claim holder's interest in CNC's interest in such property, or to the extent of
the amount subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section
506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553
of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the
Holders of Class 2A Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to
by the Holder of the Allowed Class 2A Claim and CNC, each Holder of an Allowed
Class 2A Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed
Class 2A Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CNC:

               (a)  the Allowed Class 2A Claims shall be reinstated as an
                    obligation of Reorganized CNC;

               (b)  CNC shall surrender all collateral securing such Claim to
                    the Holder thereof, without representation or warranty by or
                    further recourse against CNC or Reorganized CNC; provided
                    that, such surrender must render such Claim Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

               (c)  such Claim will be otherwise treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

         Class 2A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2A are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii) Class 3A--Reinstated Intercompany Claims (Unimpaired)

          Reinstated Intercompany Claims are those intercompany claims which,
from a regulatory perspective, cannot be cancelled or otherwise impaired under
the Plan. A list of such Reinstated Intercompany Claims is attached hereto as
Exhibit L. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of Allowed
Class 3A Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of such Claim and CNC, each Allowed Class 3A Claim shall be reinstated by
Reorganized CNC in full and final satisfaction of such Class 3A Claim.

          Class 3A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 3A Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126 (f) of
the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 3A are not
entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iii) Class 4A--Secured Note Claims (Impaired)

          Class 4A consists of any Claim against CNC for principal or interest
through the Petition Date under the Secured Senior Notes. On or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of a Class 4A Claim will
receive in respect of its Allowed Class 4A Claim, in full and final satisfaction
of all such Allowed Class 4A Claims, a Pro Rata share of the 93/94 Senior Notes
Distribution. In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Date, but subject
in all respects to the immediate occurrence of the Effective Date, the Holders
of Class 4A Claims shall be deemed to release all pre-petition liens on, and all
security interests they may have held in or against the Debtors or any of the
Debtors' Subsidiaries as of the Petition Date, including, but not limited to
their security interests in the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note.

          Class 4A is Impaired under the Plan. The Holders of Claims in Class 4A
are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iv) Class 5A--Lender Claims (Impaired)

          Class 5A consists of two subclasses of the Lender Claims against CNC:
Lender Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O Credit Facility (Class 5A-1),
which are partially Secured Claims, and all other

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

Lender Claims (Class 5A-2). The respective Class 5A Claims are Allowed for all
purposes of the Chapter 11 Cases, without the need to File proofs of claim in
the amount of the Allowed Lender Claims, but due to the contractual
subordination of certain other Allowed Claims, distributions will be made on
account of the Total Bank Debt Balance, and such Allowed Class 5A Claims and the
distributions under the Plan in respect thereof shall not be subject to offset,
reduction or counterclaim in any respect.

          On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, (x) each Holder
of an Allowed Class 5A-1 Claim shall receive on account of its Allowed Class
5A-1 Claim and its related Allowed Class 4B-1 Claim, the treatment as set forth
for Class 4B-1 in Article III.C.4 of the Plan and (y) each Holder of an Allowed
Class 5A-2 Claim shall receive on account of its Allowed Class 5A-2 Claim and
its related Allowed Class 4B-2 Claim, the treatment as set forth for Class 4B-2
set forth below. Such treatments shall be in full and final satisfaction of all
Class 5A Claims. In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Date, but
subject in all respects to the immediate occurrence of the Effective Date, the
Holders of Class 5A Claims shall be deemed to release all pre-petition liens on
and security interests in the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note. Classes 5A-1 and 5A-2
are Impaired Classes and Holders of Class 5A-1 and 5A-2 Claims are entitled to
vote separately to accept or reject the Plan.

               (v) Class 6A--Exchange Notes Claims Against CNC (Impaired)

          Class 6A consists of the Exchange Notes Claims against CNC. The Class
6A Claims are Allowed for all purposes under the Plan, without the need to file
proofs of claim, in the amounts as set forth in the Plan Supplement, and such
Allowed Class 6A Claims and the distributions under the Plan in respect thereof
shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any respect. On or
as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class
6A Claim shall receive in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class
6A Claims, in respect of its Allowed Class 6A Claim and its related Allowed
Class 5B Claim, the treatment set forth for Class 5B in Article III.B.5 of the
Plan.

               (vi) Class 7A--Original Note Claims (Impaired)

          Class 7A consists of Original Note Claims against CNC. The Class 7A
Claims are Allowed for all purposes under the Plan, without the need to file
Proofs of Claim, in the amounts as set forth in the Plan Supplement, and such
Allowed Class 7A Claims and the distributions under the Plan in respect thereof
shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any respect. On or
as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class
7A Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class
7A Claims, its pro rata share of the Original Note Distribution. Class 7A is
Impaired and Holders of Class 7A Claims are entitled to vote to accept or reject
the Plan.

               (vii) Class 8A--Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
                     (Impaired)

          Class 8A consists of the Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
against CNC. On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder
of an Allowed Class 8A Claim will receive, in full and final satisfaction of all
such Allowed Class 8A Claims, its Pro Rata share of the CNC Unsecured
Distribution. Class 8A is Impaired and Holders of Class 8A Claims are entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (viii) Class 9A--Convenience Class Claims (Unimpaired)

          Class 9A consists of the Convenience Class Claims against CNC. CNC
will treat such Allowed Class 9A Claims in a manner that will render such Claims
Unimpaired by the Bankruptcy Code. Each holder of an Allowed Class 8A Claim may
elect to be treated as a Holder of an Allowed Class 9A Convenience Class Claim.
Any such election must be made on the Ballot, and no Creditor can elect Class 9A
Claim treatment after the Voting Deadline. Each Holder of an allowed Class 9A
Claim shall receive the lesser of (a) $5,000 or (b) the amount of their Allowed
Class 8A Claim. Any Allowed Class 8A Claim that exceeds $5,000, but whose Holder
elects to be treated as a Class 9A Claim shall be automatically reduced in
complete satisfaction of such Class 8A Claim to the amount of distribution made
on account of such Convenience Class Claim. Class 9A is Unimpaired and the
Holders of Class 9A Claims are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. However, the

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

votes of Holders of Claims in Class 8A who have elected to be treated as Holders
of Class 9A Claims shall be solicited in case such elections to be treated as a
Class 9A Claim are cancelled as set forth in the Plan (in which case such votes
shall be attributed to such Claim's original Class).

               (ix) Class 10A--Trust Related Claims (Impaired)

          Class 10A consists of the Trust Related Claims. On or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class 10A Claim
shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of all such Allowed Trust Related
Claims, a portion of the Junior Recovery to be allocated by the Debtors.
Pursuant to its terms, the CNC Guarantee of the Subordinated Debenture Claims is
limited to the extent the Trusts have funds available for distribution. As of
the Petition Date, the Trusts had no funds available for distribution and,
therefore, the CNC Guarantee of Trust Originated Preferred Instrument Claims are
Allowed in the amount of $0.

          Restriction on recovery: The Junior Recovery being provided to Class
10A is subject to contractual subordination between the Holders of the
Subordinated Debenture Claims and the Lender Claims and the Senior Notes Claims
and is being provided by the Holders of the Lender Claims and the Senior Notes
in order to facilitate a consensual Plan. The Junior Recovery is being provided
with the consent of the Holders of the Lender Claims and the Senior Notes
Claims. If Class 10A fails to accept the Plan, Holders of Class 10A, 11A and 12A
Claims or Interests will not receive a distribution under the Plan, and the
distributions that are reserved for Class 10A under this paragraph shall instead
be included in the Senior Notes CNC Distribution. The Debtors reserve the right
(i) to request that the Bankruptcy Court confirm the Plan in accordance with
section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and/or (ii) to modify the Plan in
accordance with the terms hereof.

               (i) Class 1B--Other Priority Claims (Unimpaired)

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of Allowed
Class 1B Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and CIHC, each Holder of an Allowed
Class 1B Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed
Class 1B Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CIHC:

               (a)  The Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1B Claim
                    in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter
                    as is practicable; provided that, Class 1B Claims
                    representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
                    business will be paid in full in Cash when such Claim
                    becomes due and owing in the ordinary course of business;

               (b)  such Claim will otherwise be treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 1B is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1B Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, Holders of Class 1B Claims are not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii) Class 2B--Secured Claims (Unimpaired)

               (e) Other Secured Claims are Claims that are secured by a lien on
property in which CIHC has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under
section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent of the value of the Claim
holder's interest in CIHC's interest in such property, or to the extent of the
amount subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section
506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553
of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the
Holders of Class 2B Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed
to by the Holder of the Allowed Class 2B Claim and CIHC, each Holder of an
Allowed Class 2B Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such
Allowed Class 2B Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion
of CIHC:

               (a)  the Allowed Class 2B Claims shall be reinstated as an
                    obligation of Reorganized CIHC;

               (b)  CIHC shall surrender all collateral securing such Claim to
                    the Holder thereof, without representation or warranty by or
                    further recourse against CIHC or Reorganized CIHC provided
                    that, such surrender must render such Claim Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

               (c)  such Claim will be otherwise treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 2A is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2B Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2A are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

          Reinstated Intercompany Claims are those intercompany claims which,
from a regulatory perspective, cannot be cancelled or otherwise impaired under
the Plan. A list of such Reinstated Intercompany Claims is attached hereto as

Class 3B Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of such Claim and CIHC, each Allowed Class 3B Claim shall be reinstated
by Reorganized CIHC in full and final satisfaction of such Class 3B Claim. Class
3B is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 3B Claims are conclusively deemed to

               (iii) Class 4B--Lender Claims (Impaired)

          Class 4B consists of two subclasses of the Lender Claims against CIHC:
Lender Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O Credit Facility (Class 4B-1),
which are partially Secured Claims, and all other Lender Claims (Class 4B-2).
The Class 4B Claims are deemed Allowed for all purposes of the Chapter 11 Cases,
without the need to File proofs of claims, in the amount of the Allowed Lender
Claims, but due to the contractual subordination of certain other Allowed
Claims, distributions will be made on account of the Total Bank Debt Balance,
and such Allowed Class 4B Claims and the distributions in the Plan in respect of
Class 4B Claims shall not be subject to offset, reduction or counterclaim in any
respect.

          Treatment: On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each
Holder of an Allowed Class 4B Claim shall receive on account of its Allowed
Class 4B Claim and its related Allowed Class 5A Claim, its Pro Rata share of
the: (i) New Tranche A Bank Debt ; (ii) New Tranche B Bank Debt; (iii) New CNC
Preferred Stock; and (iv) New CNC Warrants. CIHC will guaranty the New Tranche A
Bank Debt and the New Tranche B Bank Debt and the obligations in respect thereof
will be secured as contemplated by the New Credit Facility. Such treatment shall
be in full and final satisfaction of all Class 4B Claims and Class 5A Claims,
and of any rights to contractual subordination of other Allowed Claims for the
benefit of Class 4B Claims and Class 5A Claims. In addition, immediately prior
to the Effective Date, but subject in all respects to the immediate occurrence
of the Effective Date, the Holders of Class 4B Claims and Class 5A Claims shall
be deemed to release all pre-petition liens on and security interests in the
CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note. In addition, the Lenders' Agents and each of the
Lenders shall receive in Cash on the Effective Date an amount equal to all of
its fees and expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of
counsel and financial advisors) incurred in connection with the Senior Credit
Facility or the D&O Credit Facilities, as the case may be, including, without
limitation, in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Plan, the
implementation of the Plan or any documentation relating thereto. The New
Tranche A Bank Debt and New Tranche B Bank Debt shall be issued in separate
tranches as follows: (i) to Holders of Claims under the Senior Credit Facility,
(ii) to Holders of Claims under or derived from the 1999 D&O Facility and (iii)
to Holders of Claims under or derived from the other D&O Credit Facilities. The
Lenders under the respective D&O Credit Facilities shall be deemed to have
transferred to Reorganized CNC all loans made to the individual borrowers under
the D&O Credit Facilities and all rights and remedies in respect thereof to
Reorganized CNC, and all amounts paid by such borrowers shall be applied to the
loans under the New Credit Facility as set forth in the New Credit Facility. As
of the Date of the Disclosure Statement, the Lender Subcommittee, the Note
Subcommittee and the Debtors have not agreed on the scope of the Lender's
involvement with respect to such loans after the transfer to the Reorganized
Debtors.

          Classes 4B-1 and 4B-2 are Impaired Classes and Holders of Class 4B-1
and 4B-2 Claims are entitled to vote to separately accept or reject the Plan.

               (iv) Class 5B--Exchange Notes Claims (Impaired)

          Class 5B consists of Exchange Note Claims against CIHC.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Plan, the Class
5B Claims shall be deemed Allowed Class 5B Claims for all purposes under the
Chapter 11 Cases, without the need to File proofs of claim, in the amounts as
set forth in the Plan Supplement. On or as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, Holders of Allowed Class 5B Claims will receive in full and
final satisfaction of all such Allowed Class 6A and Class 5B Claims its Pro Rata
share of the Exchanged Note Distribution. In addition, the professionals of the
Unofficial Noteholders Committee will be paid on the Effective Date in Cash the
unpaid fees and expenses (whether incurred prior to or after the Petition Date)
in accordance with their prepetition engagement letters. Class 5B is Impaired
and is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

          Class 7B consists of the Convenience Class Claims against CIHC. CIHC
will treat such Allowed 7B Claims in a manner that will render such Claims
Unimpaired under the Bankruptcy Code. Each Holder of an Allowed Class 6B General
Unsecured Claim may elect to be treated as a Holder of an Allowed Class 7B
Convenience Class Claim. Any such election must be made on the Ballot, and no
Creditor can elect Class 7B Claim treatment after the Voting Deadline. Each
Holder of an Allowed Class 7B Claim shall receive the lesser of (a) $5,000 or
(b) the amount of their Allowed Class 6B Claim. Any Allowed Class 6B Claim that
exceeds $5,000 but whose Holder elects to be treated as a Class 7B Claim shall
be automatically reduced in complete satisfaction of such Class 6B Claim to the
amount of distribution made on account of such Convenience Class Claim. Class 7B
is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 7B Claims are conclusively presumed to
have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.
However, the Holders of Claims in Class 6B who have elected to be treated as
Holders of Class 7B Claims shall be solicited in case the election to be treated
as a Class 7B Claim were cancelled in accordance with the Plan (in which case
such values shall be attributed to such Claims' original Class).

               (vii) Class 8B--Reinstated CIHC Preferred Stock Interests
                    (Unimpaired)

          Class 8B consists of Interests relating to the Reinstated CIHC

Reinstated CIHC Preferred Stock Interests. Class 8B is Unimpaired and the

               (i) Class 1C--Other Priority Claims (Unimpaired)

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual
rights of the Holders of Allowed Class 1C Claims are unaltered by the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and
CTIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class 1C Claim shall receive, in full and final
satisfaction of such Allowed Class 1C Claim, one of the following treatments, in
the sole discretion of CTIHC:

               (a)  The Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1C Claim
                    in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter
                    as is practicable, provided that, Class 1C Claims
                    representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
                    business will be paid in full in Cash when such Class 1C
                    Claims become due and owing in the ordinary course of
                    business;

               (b)  such Claim will otherwise be treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 1C is not impaired and the Holders of Class 1C Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the

subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section 506(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of

Holder of the Allowed Class 2C Claim and CTIHC, each Holder of an Allowed Class
2C Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed Class 2C
Claim, one of the following treatments, in the sole discretion of CTIHC:

               (a)  the Allowed Class 2C Claims shall be reinstated as an
                    obligation of Reorganized CTIHC;

               (b)  CTIHC shall surrender all collateral securing such Claim to
                    the Holder thereof, without representation or warranty by or
                    recourse against CTIHC or Reorganized CTIHC, provided that,
                    such surrender must render such Claim Unimpaired pursuant to
                    Section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

               (c)  such Claim will be otherwise treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 2C is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2C Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2C are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

</TABLE>


               (i) Class 1D--Other Priority Claims (Unimpaired)

          An Other Priority Claim means a Claim, other than an Administrative
Claim or Priority Tax Claim, that is entitled to priority in payment pursuant to
section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual
rights of the Holders of Allowed Class 1D Claims are unaltered by the Plan.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder of the Allowed Other Priority Claim and
PHG, each Holder of an Allowed Class 1D Claim shall receive, in full and final
satisfaction of such Allowed Class 1D Claim, one of the following alternative
treatments, in the sole discretion of PHG:

               (a)  The Distribution Agent will pay the Allowed Class 1D Claim
                    in full in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter
                    as is practicable, provided that, Class 1D Claims
                    representing obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
                    business will be paid in full in Cash when such Class 1D
                    Claims become due and owing in the ordinary course of
                    business;

               (b)  such Claim will otherwise be treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

                                      -54-
<PAGE>


          Class 1D is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 1D Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 1D are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (ii) Class 2D--Other Secured Claims (Unimpaired)

          Other Secured Claims are Claims that are secured by a lien on property
in which PHG has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under section 553 of
the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent of the value of the Claim holder's interest
in PHG's interest in such property, or to the extent of the amount subject to
setoff, as applicable, as determined pursuant to section 506(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, or in the case of setoff, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the Holders of
Class 2D Claims are unaltered by the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Holder of the Allowed Class 2D Claim and PHG, each Holder of an Allowed Class 2D
Claim shall receive, in full and final satisfaction of such Allowed Class 2D
Claim, one of the following alternative treatments, in the sole discretion of
PHG:

               (a)  the Allowed Class 2D Claims shall be reinstated as an
                    obligation of Reorganized PHG;

               (b)  The Distribution Agent shall surrender all collateral
                    securing such Claim to the Holder thereof, without
                    representation or warranty by or recourse against PHG or
                    Reorganized PHG, provided that, such surrender must render
                    such Claim Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the
                    Bankruptcy Code; or

               (c)  such Claim will be otherwise treated in any other manner so
                    that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
                    pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

          Class 2D is unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2D Claims are
conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of Claims in Class 2D are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

               (iii) Class 3D -Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims
                    (Impaired)

          Class 3D Claims will voluntarily waive any right to receive a
distribution under the Plan. CIHC is the only creditor in Class 3D and approves
its treatment under this Subplan.

               (iv) Class 4D - Old PHG Common Stock Interests (Impaired)

               (v) Under the Plan, Class 4D consists of Interests in PHG. PHG is
     a Residual Subsidiary and the Old PHG Common Stock will be transferred to
     the Residual Trust. CIHC is the indirect parent of PHG. CIHC and
     intermediate holding company approve of their treatment under this Subplan.

          3.   Summary of Claims and Equity Interests against the Liquidating
               Debtors

          The Liquidating Debtors currently anticipate selling substantially all
of their assets pursuant to a Purchase Agreement and a motion pending before the
Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors reserve the right to amend the Plan to provide for
the distribution of sale proceeds and any residual assets.

include those that arise from the plans, funds or programs described in the Plan

G.        TREATMENT OF LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Debtors are involved on an ongoing basis in lawsuits (including
purported class actions) relating to their operations, including with respect to
sales practices, and certain of their current and former officers and directors
are defendants in pending class action lawsuits asserting claims under the
securities laws and derivative lawsuits. The ultimate outcome of these lawsuits
cannot be predicted with certainty.

          1.   Securities Litigation

          As disclosed in CNC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2002, CNC has settled certain securities litigation for $120
million. Of this amount, $95 million was paid by CNC's director and officer
insurers. Certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's") have refused to
pay the remaining $25 million. CNC is currently litigating coverage with
Lloyd's. If CNC does not prevail in this litigation, then CNC will be required
to pay the remaining $25 million in connection with the settlement. This Claim
is classified as Class 14A Securities Claims pursuant to section 510(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

          Since our August 9, 2002 announcement, a total of eight purported
securities fraud class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaints name CNC as
a defendant, along with certain current and former officers of CNC. These
lawsuits were filed on behalf of persons or entities who purchased CNC's common
stock on various dates between October 24, 2001 and August 9, 2002. These Claims
are classified as Class 14A and 11B Securities Claims under the Plan. The
maximum exposure to the Company from these lawsuits is estimated to be $275
million. CNC, however, believes that these lawsuits are meritless. Additionally,
CNC has filed

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

an adversary proceeding to extend the automatic stay provided for
by the Bankruptcy Code to this litigation as it pertains to current and former
officers and directors of CNC.

          In October 2002, Roderick Russell, on behalf of himself and a class of
persons similarly situated, and on behalf of the ConsecoSavePlan, filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
against CNC, Conseco Services and certain current and former officers of CNC
(Roderick Russell, et al. v Conseco, Inc., et al., Case No. I :02-CV -1639 LJM).
The purported class action consists of all individuals whose 401(k) accounts
held common stock of CNC at any time from April 28, 1999 through the present.
The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty. These
claims are classified as 14A and 11B Securities Claims under the Plan. The
maximum exposure to the Company from this lawsuit is estimated to be $53
million. CNC, however, believes that this lawsuit is meritless. Additionally,
CNC has filed an adversary proceeding to extend the automatic stay provided for
by the Bankruptcy Code to this litigation as it pertains to current and former
officers and directors of CNC.

          In January 2002, CTIHC was named as a defendant in a purported class
action lawsuit filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of stockholders
of Telecorp PCS, Inc. ("Telecorp"). Plaintiffs in this lawsuit allege that
CTIHC, formerly a substantial stockholder of Telecorp, aided and abetted alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties by Telecorp's board of directors in connection with
the merger of Telecorp and AT&T Wireless. CTIHC believes this lawsuit is
meritless. Under CTIHC's Subplan, if the Claim relating to this lawsuit is
ultimately Allowed against CTIHC, then holders of such Claim will receive the
stock of CTIHC.

          2.   Derivative Litigation

          Nine shareholder derivative suits were filed in 2000 in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaints named
the current directors, certain former directors, certain non-director officers
of CNC (in one case), and alleging aiding and abetting liability, certain banks
that allegedly made loans in relation to CNC's "Stock Purchase Plan" (in three
cases). CNC is also named as a nominal defendant in each complaint. These cases
have now been consolidated into one case in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana, captioned: "In Re Conseco, Inc. Derivative
Litigation", Case Number IP00655-C-Y/S. Two similar cases have been filed in the
Hamilton County Superior Court in Indiana. The cases filed in Hamilton County
have been stayed pending resolution of the derivative suits filed in the United
States District Court. CNC asserts that these lawsuits are assets of the estate
pursuant to section 541(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and does not currently intend
to pursue them postpetition because they are meritless. The maximum exposure to
the Company for these lawsuits is unknown.

          3.   Other Litigation

          On January 15, 2002, Carmel Fifth, LLC ("Carmel"), an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of CNC, exercised its rights to require 767 Manager, LLC
("Manager"), an affiliate of Donald J. Trump, to elect within 60 days, either to
acquire Carmel's interests in 767 LLC for $499.4 million, or to sell its
interests in 767 LLC to Carmel for $15.6 million (the "Buy/Sell Right"). Such
rights were exercised pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of 767
LLC. 767 LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that indirectly owns the
General Motors Building, a 50-story office building in New York, New York (the
"GM Building"). 767 LLC is owned by Carmel and Manager. On February 6, 2002, Mr.
Trump commenced a civil action against CNC, Carmel and 767 LLC in New York State
Supreme Court, entitled Donald J. Trump v. Conseco, Inc., et al. (the "State
Court Action"). Plaintiff claims that CNC and Carmel breached an agreement,
dated July 3, 2001, to sell Carmel's interests in 767 LLC to plaintiff for $295
million on or before September 15, 2001 (the "July 3rd Agreement").
Specifically, plaintiff claims that CNC and Carmel improperly refused to accept
a reasonable guaranty of plaintiff's payment obligations, refused to complete
the sale of Carmel's interest before the September 15, 2001 deadline, repudiated
an oral promise to extend the September 15 deadline indefinitely and repudiated
the July 3rd Agreement by exercising Carmel's Buy/Sell Right. Plaintiff asserts
claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary
duty. Plaintiff is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of approximately $1
billion and declaratory and injunctive relief blocking Carmel's Buy/Sell Right.
On March 25, 2002,

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

Carmel filed a Demand for Arbitration and Petition and Statement of Claim with
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to have the issues relating to the
Buy/Sell Right resolved by arbitration (the "Arbitration"). Manager and Mr.
Trump requested the New York State Supreme Court to stay that arbitration, but
the Court denied Manager's and Trump's request on May 2, 2002, allowing the
arbitration to proceed. Mr. Trump and Manager appealed that decision to the New
York Appellate Division. Their appeal is to be heard during the February Term.
In addition, CNC and Carmel filed a Motion to Dismiss Mr. Trump's lawsuit on
March 25, 2002. By Stipulation and Order, dated June 14, 2002, the State Court
Action was stayed, pending resolution of the Arbitration. On June 10, 2002,
Manager and Trump filed their Statement of Position which included affirmative
defenses and counterclaims against Carmel and CNC, arising out of the same
alleged breaches of the July 3rd Agreement that had formed the basis of the
State Court Action. The Arbitration was heard by a Panel of three arbitrators in
five hearing days between September 25, 2002 and October 29, 2002, and the
parties filed Post-Hearing Briefs on November 5, 2002. At the first arbitration
hearing the Panel unanimously ruled, in response to Carmel's motion for partial
summary judgment, that "unless respondent 767 Manager can establish what amounts
to an affirmative defense" based upon CNC's supposed breach of the July 3rd
Agreement, Carmel would be entitled to enforce its Buy/Sell Right. While
awaiting a decision from the Panel, upon Trump's motion, AAA disqualified one of
the neutral arbitrators. CNC plans to vigorously pursue its options to compel
prompt resolution of this dispute. CNC believes that Mr. Trump's lawsuit is
without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its own rights to acquire the GM
Building. The ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. If Trump's
entities ultimately hold an Allowed Claim against CNC, such Claim is classified
as a Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claim against CNC.

          On June 24, 2002, the heirs of a former officer, Lawrence Inlow,
commenced an action against CNC, Conseco Services and two former officers in the
Boone Circuit Court (Inlow et al. v. Conseco, Inc., et al., Cause No.
06C01-0206-CT-244). The heirs assert that unvested options to purchase 756,248
shares of CNC common stock should have been vested at Mr. Inlow's death. The
heirs further claim that if such options had been vested, they would have been
exercised, and that the resulting shares of common stock would have been sold
for a gain of approximately $30 million based upon a stock price of $58.125 per
share, the highest stock price during the alleged exercise period of the
options. CNC believes the heirs' claims are without merit and will defend the
action vigorously. The maximum exposure to the Company for this lawsuit is
estimated to be $33 million, although CNC believes that the lawsuit is without
merit. The ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. Under the Plan,
claims relating to this lawsuit, if allowed, will be treated as Class 8A
Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims, although the Debtors reserve their
right to seek to subordinate this claim under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

          CNC is also a party to litigation related to the death of Lawrence
Inlow with the manufacturer of the corporate helicopter and other parties. This
litigation was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Indiana (In re: Inlow Accident Litigation, Cause No.
IP99-0830-C-H/G) and is currently on appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals. The maximum exposure for this litigation is estimated to be $25
million, although CNC believes that the claims against it are without merit. The
ultimate outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. Under the Plan claims
relating to this lawsuit, if allowed, will be treated as Class 8A Reorganizing
Debtor General Unsecured and Claims. CNC is also party to litigation with
Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. in Hamilton County Superior Court
(Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Conseco Inc., et al, Cause No.
29C01-9909-CP588) relating to Associated Aviation Underwriters' obligation to
defend and/or indemnify CNC in the aforementioned litigation. If CNC prevails in
this lawsuit, Associated Underwriters may be obligated to indemnify the CNC for
all or part of its liability in the aforementioned litigation. This litigation
has been stayed until final judgments are rendered in the former litigation.

          In addition, CNC and its subsidiaries are involved on an ongoing basis
in other lawsuits and arbitrations (including purported class actions) related
to their operations. These actions include one action brought by the Texas
Attorney General regarding long term care policies, two purported nationwide
class actions involving claims related to "vanishing premiums," two purported
nationwide class actions involving claims related to "modal premiums" (the
alleged imposition and collection of insurance premium surcharges in excess of
stated annual premiums) and an arbitration involving a dispute with a reinsurer
of a block of long term care business, among others. The ultimate outcome of all
of these other legal matters

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

pending against CNC or its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, and, although such
lawsuits are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on CNC,
such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on CNC's
consolidated financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The
maximum aggregate exposure for such lawsuits is estimated to be approximately
$22 million. Under the Plan, claims relating to these lawsuits, if allowed, will
be treated as Class 8A Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

          4.   Other Proceedings

          CNC has been notified that the staff of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission has obtained a formal order of investigation in connection
with an inquiry that relates to events in and before the spring of 2000,
including CNC's accounting for its interest-only securities and servicing
rights. These issues were among those addressed in CNC's write-down and
restatement in the spring of 2000, and were the subject of shareholder class
action litigation, which has recently been settled as described above. CNC is
cooperating with the SEC staff in this matter.

          CNC has been notified that the Alabama Securities Commission is
examining CNC's 1998 Directors/Officers & Key Employees Stock Purchase Program
and the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Program Work-Down Plan. CNC is cooperating
with the Commissioner's staff in this matter.

H.        TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

          1.   Reorganizing Debtors: Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

          Immediately prior to the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided
in the Plan, all executory contracts, including without limitation, the
prepetition engagement letters for the Unofficial Bank Committee and the
Unofficial Noteholder Committee, or unexpired leases of the Reorganizing Debtors
will be deemed assumed in accordance with the provisions and requirements of
sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code except those executory contracts
and unexpired leases that (1) have been rejected by order of the Bankruptcy
Court,(3) (2) have previously been assumed by order of the Bankruptcy Court,(4)
(3) are the subject of a motion to reject pending on the Effective Date, (4) are
identified in the Plan Supplement to be rejected, (5) that relate to the
purchase or other acquisition of Equity Interests. Entry of the Confirmation
Order by the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such assumptions and
rejections pursuant to sections 365(a) and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          2.   Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired
               Leases

          All Proofs of Claims with respect to Claims arising from the rejection
of executory contracts or unexpired leases, if any, must be Filed with the
Bankruptcy Court within thirty (30) days after the date of entry of an order of
the Bankruptcy Court approving such rejection (which order, in the case of
executory contracts or unexpired leases rejected pursuant to the Plan, shall be
the Confirmation Order). Any Claims arising from the rejection of an executory
contract or unexpired lease not Filed within such time will be forever barred
from assertion against any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, any Estate or property
of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy
Court. All Allowed Claims arising from the rejection of executory contracts or
unexpired leases of the Reorganizing Debtors will be classified as Reorganizing
Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

     Statement is attached to this Disclosure Statement as Exhibit H.

          3.   Cure of Defaults for Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases
               Assumed

          Any monetary amounts by which each executory contract and unexpired
lease to be assumed pursuant to the Plan is in default shall be satisfied,
pursuant to section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, by payment of the default
amount in Cash on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is practicable,
or on such other terms as the parties to such executory contracts or unexpired
leases may otherwise agree. In the event of a dispute regarding: (1) the amount
of any cure payments, (2) the ability of the relevant Reorganized Debtor or any
assignee to provide "adequate assurance of future performance" (within the
meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under the contract or lease to be
assumed, or (3) any other matter pertaining to assumption, the cure payments
required by section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be made following the
entry of a Final Order resolving the dispute and approving the assumption.

          4.   Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees

          The obligations of any of the Debtors to indemnify any Person serving
at any time on or prior to the Effective Date as one of its directors, officers
or employees by reason of such Person's service in such capacity, or as a
director, officer or employee of any other corporation or legal entity, to the
extent provided in such Debtor's constitutive documents, by a written agreement
with such Debtor or under Indiana or Delaware state corporate law (to the
maximum extent permitted thereunder), shall be deemed and treated as executory
contracts that are assumed by the relevant Reorganized Debtor (it being
understood that Reorganized CNC is the relevant Reorganized Debtor of CNC)
pursuant hereto and section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective Date.
Accordingly, such indemnification obligations shall survive unimpaired and
unaffected by entry of the Confirmation Order, irrespective of whether such
indemnification is owed for an act or event occurring before or after the
Petition Date. The Conseco Creditors Committee has not yet agreed to this and is
continuing its investigation with respect to these matters.

          5.   Compensation and Benefit Programs

          Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, all employment and
severance agreements and policies, and all compensation and benefit plans,
policies, and programs of the Debtors applicable to their respective employees,
former employees, retirees and non-employee directors and the employees, former
employees and retirees of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all
savings plans, retirement plans, health care plans, disability plans, severance
benefit agreements and plans, incentive plans, deferred compensation plans and
life, accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans shall be treated as
executory contracts under the Plan and on the Effective Date shall be deemed
assumed pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy
Code; and the Debtors' obligations under such programs to Persons shall survive
confirmation of the Plan, except for (i) executory contracts or employee benefit
plans specifically rejected pursuant to the Plan (to the extent such rejection
does not violate sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code), (ii) all
employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and (iii) such executory
contracts or employee benefit plans as have previously been rejected, are the
subject of a motion to reject as of the Confirmation Date, or have been
specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan or
contract; provided however, that the Debtors' obligations, if any, to pay all
"retiree benefits" as defined in section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall
continue.

          6.   Assumption of D&O Insurance

          All directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
by the Debtors are hereby assumed. Entry of the order confirming the Plan by the
clerk of the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such assumptions
pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Reorganized Debtors shall
maintain for a period not less than 10 years from the Effective Date coverage
for the individuals covered, as of the Petition Date, by such policies at levels
and on terms no less favorable to such individuals than the terms and levels
provided for under the policies assumed pursuant to the Plan. Solely with
respect to directors and officers of any of the Debtors who served in such
capacity at any time on or after the Petition Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
to assume, as of the Effective Date, their respective obligations to indemnify
such individuals (and only such individuals) with respect to or based upon any
act or omission taken or omitted in any of such capacities, or for or on behalf
of any Debtor,

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

pursuant to and to the extent provided by the Debtors' respective articles of
incorporation, certificates of formation, corporate charters, bylaws and similar
corporate documents as in effect as of the date of entry of the Confirmation
Order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, such
assumed indemnity obligations shall not be discharged, Impaired, or otherwise
modified by confirmation of the Plan and shall be deemed and treated as
executory contracts that have been assumed by the Debtors pursuant to the Plan
as to which no proofs of claim need be Filed. The Conseco Creditors Committee
has not yet agreed to this and is continuing its investigation with respect to
these matters.

I.        PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS

          1.   Distributions for Claims and Equity Interests Allowed as of the
               Effective Date

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or as may be ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court, distributions to be made on the Effective Date on account of
Claims and Equity Interests that are Allowed as of the Effective Date and are
entitled to receive distributions under the Plan shall be made on the Effective
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

          For purposes of determining the accrual of interest, dividends or
rights in respect of any other payment from and after the Effective Date, the
New Tranche A Bank Debt, the New Tranche B Bank Debt, the New Secured Notes, New
CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Warrants and New CNC Common Stock shall be deemed
issued as of the Effective Date regardless of the date on which they are
actually dated, authenticated or distributed; provided that the respective
Reorganized Debtor shall withhold any actual payment until such distribution is
made and no interest shall accrue or otherwise be payable on any such withheld
amounts.

          2.   Distributions by the Reorganized Debtors; Distributions with
               Respect to Debt Securities

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Distribution Agent shall
make all distributions required under the Reorganizing Subplans, except (i) as
otherwise provided in the Plan, or (ii) with respect to a Holder of a Claim or
Equity Interest whose distribution is governed by an indenture, credit agreement
or other agreement and is administered by an Indenture Trustee, agent, or
servicer, which distributions shall be deposited with the appropriate Indenture
Trustee, agent, or servicer, who shall deliver such distributions to the Holders
of Claims or Equity Interest in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the terms of the relevant indenture, credit agreement or other governing
agreement. The Distribution Agent will receive from the respective Reorganized
Debtor, without further Bankruptcy Court approval, reasonable compensation for
such services and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
such services. These payments will be made on terms agreed to with the
Reorganized Debtors and will not be deducted from distributions made under the
Reorganizing Subplans.

          3.   Delivery and Distributions and Undeliverable or Unclaimed
               Distributions

               (a)  Delivery of Distributions in General

          Distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests shall be made to the Holders of such Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests as of the Distribution Record Date. Except as otherwise provided in
Article VIII.D.2 of the Plan, distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Equity Interests shall be made at the address of the Holder of such
Claim or Equity Interest as indicated on the records of the Debtors as of the
date that such distribution is made.

               (b)  Undeliverable Distributions

               (i)  Holding of Undeliverable Distributions.

          If any distribution to a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity
Interest is returned to the Distribution Agent as undeliverable, no further
distributions shall be made to such Holder unless and until the Distribution
Agent is notified in writing of such Holder's then-current address.

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

Undeliverable distributions shall remain in the possession of the Distribution
Agent subject to Article VIII.C.2.b of the Plan until such time as a
distribution becomes deliverable. Undeliverable Cash shall not be entitled to
any interest, dividends or other accruals of any kind. As soon as reasonably
practicable, the Distribution Agent shall make all distributions that become
deliverable.

               (ii) Failure to Claim Undeliverable Distributions

          In an effort to ensure that all Holders of Allowed Claims and Equity
Interests receive their allocated distributions, ninety (90) days after the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court a
listing of unclaimed distribution. This list will be maintained for as long as
the Chapter 11 Cases stay open. Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest (irrespective of when a Claim or Equity Interest became an Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest) that does not assert a Claim or Equity Interest
pursuant hereto for an undeliverable distribution (regardless of when not
deliverable) within two years after the Effective Date shall have its Claim or
Equity Interest for such undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be
forever barred from asserting any such Claim or Equity Interest against the
relevant Reorganized Debtor or its property. In such cases: (i) any Cash held
for distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be property
of the relevant Reorganized Debtor or Liquidating Plan Administrator, free of
any restrictions thereon; and (ii) any securities issued under the Plan held for
distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be canceled and
of no further force or effect. Nothing contained in the Plan shall require the
Distribution Agent to attempt to locate any Holder of an Allowed Claim or
Allowed Equity Interest.

               (c)  Compliance with Tax Requirements/Allocations.

          In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, each
Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor and the Distribution Agent shall comply
with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any
governmental unit, and all distributions pursuant hereto shall be subject to
such withholding and reporting requirements. Each Reorganizing Debtor,
Reorganized Debtor and Distribution Agent shall be authorized to take all
actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting
requirements. For tax purposes, distributions received in respect of Allowed
Claims will be allocated first to the principal amount of Allowed Claims, with
any excess allocated to unpaid interest that accrued on such Claims.

          4.   Timing and Calculation of Amounts to be Distributed

          On the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each
Holder of an Allowed Claim against or Allowed Equity Interest in the Debtors
shall receive the full amount of the distributions that the Plan provides for
Allowed Claims or Allowed Equity Interests in the applicable Class. If and to
the extent that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests,
distributions on account of such Disputed Claim or Equity Interest shall be made
pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article X.A.4 of the Plan.

          5.   Minimum Distribution

          Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, payments of fractions
of shares of New CNC Common Stock or New CNC Preferred Stock or fractions of New
CNC Warrants will not be made and will be deemed to be zero. Any other provision
of the Plan notwithstanding, the Reorganized Debtors or the Distribution Agent
will not be required to make distributions or payments of fractions of dollars.
Whenever any payment of a fraction of a dollar under the Plan would otherwise be
called for, the actual payment will reflect a rounding of such fraction to the
nearest whole dollar (up or down), with half dollars or less being rounded down.

          6.   Setoffs

          Except as expressly provided for in the Plan, each Reorganizing Debtor
and Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code or applicable non-bankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan
on account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is
made on account of

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

such Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests, rights and Causes
of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as
the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests, rights or Causes of Action
against such Holder have not been compromised or settled on or prior to the
Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or otherwise); provided that,
neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any Claim or
Equity Interest under the Plan shall constitute a waiver or release by such
Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor
may possess against such Holder.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distribution contemplated by the Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Notes shall be offset against (i) the CFC/CIHC
Intercompany Notes, (ii) all other prepetition amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all
postpetition amounts owed by CFC that are not repaid in full in Cash by CFC,
including, without limitation, health and welfare benefits, insurance, other
direct CFC expenses and an appropriate allocation of the postpetition
professional fees paid by CIHC. Any balance of the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Notes
remaining after giving effect to the setoffs in the preceding sentence will be
Class 6B Claims.

          In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Liquidating
Debtors all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Liquidating Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts owing under the
prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) in connection with EXL Services.com,
(iii) an appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees incurred by the
Debtors in connection with restructuring of the Debtors and the preparation for
these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv) prepetition amounts owing by the Liquidating
Debtors to Conseco Services LLC or CIHC, and (y) postpetition amounts owing by
the Liquidating Debtors to the Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full
in Cash, including without limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments
owed by the Liquidating Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the
postpetition professional fees incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors during these
Chapter 11 Cases and (iii) postpetition amounts owed by the Liquidating Debtors
to Conseco Services or CIHC.

          7.   Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities

          Subject to Article VIII.I of the Plan, each record Holder of an
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest relating to the (i) Senior Credit Facility,
(ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii) CNC Guarantee of D&O
Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (v) Exchange
Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated Debentures, (viii) CNC Common
Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates or other
documentation underlying such Claim or Equity Interest, and all such surrendered
certificates and other documentations shall be marked as canceled.

          8.   Failure to Surrender Canceled Instruments

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii)
CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchange Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that fails to
surrender or is deemed to have failed to surrender its certificates or other
documentation representing such Claim or Equity Interest required to be tendered
under the Plan within one year after the Effective Date shall have its Claim for
a distribution pursuant hereto on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interests discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting any such
Claim or Equity Interest against any Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or
the Distribution Agent or their assets.

          9.   Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Securities

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii)
CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchange Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that is
evidenced by a note or by a stock certificate which has been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed shall, in lieu of surrendering such note

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

or stock certificate, deliver to the Distribution Agent: (a) an affidavit of
loss reasonably satisfactory to the Distribution Agent setting forth the
unavailability of the note or the stock certificate; and (b) such additional
security or indemnity as may reasonably be required by the Distribution Agent to
hold the Distribution Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs
incurred in treating such individual as a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest. Upon compliance with this procedure by a Holder of an Allowed Claim or
Equity Interest evidenced by such a lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed note or
stock certificate, such Holder shall, for all purposes under the Plan, be deemed
to have surrendered such note or certificate.

J.        PROCEDURES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED, CONTINGENT AND UNLIQUIDATED
          CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS

          1. Resolution of Disputed Claims

               (a)  Prosecution of Objections to Claims

          After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (for Claims against
the Reorganized Debtors) shall have the exclusive authority on or before the
Claims Objection Bar Date to file objections, settle, compromise, withdraw or
litigate to judgment objections to Claims or Equity Interests. From and after
the Effective Date, the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may settle or
compromise any Disputed Claim or Equity Interest without approval of the
Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors, the Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized
Debtors also reserve the right to resolve any Disputed Claims or Equity
Interests outside the Bankruptcy Court under applicable governing law.

               (b)  Estimation of Claims and Equity Interests

          The Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may, at any time,
request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim
or Equity Interest pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code regardless
of whether such Reorganizing Debtor and Reorganized Debtor has previously
objected to such Claim or Equity Interest or whether the Bankruptcy Court has
ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction
to estimate any Claim or Equity Interest at any time during litigation
concerning any objection to any Claim or Equity Interest, including during the
pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. In the event that the
Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that estimated
amount will constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a maximum
limitation on such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. If the
estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the relevant
Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental
proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All of the
aforementioned Claims or Equity Interests and objection, estimation and
resolution procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one
another. Claims and Equity Interests may be estimated and subsequently
compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by any mechanism approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

               (c)  Payments and Distributions on Disputed Claims and Equity
                    Interests

          Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, except as
otherwise agreed by a Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor (for Claims
against the Reorganizing Debtors) in their sole discretion, no partial payments
and no partial distributions will be made with respect to a Disputed Claim or
Equity Interest until the resolution of such disputes by settlement or Final
Order. On the date or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next
successive Business Day that is 20 calendar days after the calendar quarter in
which a Disputed Claim or Equity Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interest, the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest
will receive all payments and distributions to which such Holder is then
entitled under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person or Entity who
holds both an Allowed Claim(s) and a Disputed Claim(s) (or an Allowed Equity
Interest(s) and a Disputed Equity Interest(s)) will not receive the appropriate
payment or distribution on the Allowed Claim(s) (or Allowed Equity Interest(s)),
except as otherwise agreed by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as
the case may be, in its sole discretion, until the Disputed Claim(s) or Disputed
Equity Interest(s) are resolved by settlement or Final Order. In the event that
there are Disputed Claims or

                                      -66-
<PAGE>

Equity Interests requiring adjudication and resolution, the Reorganizing Debtors
and Reorganized Debtors reserve the right, or upon order of the Court, to
establish appropriate reserves for potential payment of such Claims or Equity
Interests.

          Except as expressly provided in the Plan or in any order entered in

Order), no Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed Allowed, unless and until
such Claim or Equity Interest is deemed Allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or the
Bankruptcy Court enters a Final Order in the Chapter 11 Cases allowing such
Claim or Equity Interest. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or any order
entered in the Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the
Confirmation Order) and the Reorganizing Debtors (for Claims against the
Reorganizing Debtors) or Reorganized Debtors after confirmation will have and

          3.   Controversy Concerning Impairment

          4.   Reserve of New CNC Common Stock

L.        RELEASE, INJUNCTIVE AND RELATED PROVISIONS

          1.   Compromise and Settlement

          The allowance, classification and treatment of all Allowed Claims and
Equity Interests and the respective distributions and treatments under the Plan
take into account and/or conform to the relative priority and rights of the
Claims and Equity Interests in each Class in connection with any contractual,
legal and equitable subordination rights relating thereto whether arising under
general principles of equitable subordination, section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, and, as of the Effective Date, any and all such rights are
settled, compromised and released pursuant hereto. In addition, the allowance,
classification and treatment of Allowed Claims in Classes 4A, 5A, 4B, 5B, 6A and
6B takes into account any Causes of Action, claims or counterclaims, whether
under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law, that may exist between the
Debtors and the Holders of such Claims or among the Holders of such Claims and
other Holders of Claims or Equity Interests, and, as of the Effective Date, any
and all such Causes of Action, claims and counterclaims are settled, compromised
and released pursuant hereto. The Confirmation Order shall permanently enjoin,
effective as of the Effective Date, all Persons and Entities from enforcing or

rights or Causes of Action, claims or counterclaims against such Holder

          2.   Releases by the Debtors

          Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, for good and
valuable consideration, including the service of the Releasees to facilitate the
expeditious reorganization of the Debtors and the implementation of the
restructuring contemplated by the Plan, the Releasees, on and after the
Effective Date, are deemed released by the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors
from any and all Claims (as defined in section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code),
obligations, rights, suits, damages, causes of action, remedies and liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or
hereinafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors or their subsidiaries would have been legally entitled to
assert in their own right (whether individually or collectively) or on behalf of
the Holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or other Person or Entity, based in
whole or in part upon any act or omission, transaction, agreement, event or
other occurrence taking place on or before the Effective Date, other than Claims
or liabilities arising out of or relating to each Releasee's obligations to
repay its obligations under the D&O Credit Facilities. As of the Date of the
Disclosure Statement, the Lender Subcommittee, the Note Subcommittee and the
Debtors have not agreed on the scope of these provisions.

          3.   Releases by Holders of Claims

          On and after the Effective Date, each Holder of a Claim (a) who has
accepted the Plan or (b) who is entitled to receive a distribution of property
in connection with or is classified under with the Plan, shall be deemed to have
unconditionally released the Releasees from any and all Claims (as defined in
section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), obligations, rights, suits, damages,
Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including any derivative
Claims asserted on behalf of Debtor, whether known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that
such Person or Entity would have been legally entitled to assert (whether
individually or collectively), based in whole or in part upon any act or
omission, transaction, agreement, event or other occurrence taking place on or
before the Effective Date in any way relating or pertaining to (w) the purchase
or sale, or the rescission of a purchase or sale, of any security of a Debtor,
(x) a Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, (y) the Chapter 11 Cases, or (z) the
negotiation, formulation and preparation of the Plan or any related agreements,
instruments or

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

other documents. No portion of the limited releases by the Holders of Claims in
any way impairs any Cause of Action, liability, Claim or right arising out of or
relating to their obligations to repay the D&O Credit Facilities. As of the Date
of the Disclosure Statement, the Lender Subcommittee, the Note Subcommittee and
the Debtors have not agreed on the scope of these provisions.

          4.   Exculpation

          The Debtors, Reorganizing Debtors, the Releasees, Noteholder
Subcommittee, Lender Subcommittee and the Official Committees, the Unofficial
Noteholder Committee, Unofficial Bank Committee and their respective members,
and the employees, agents, and professionals of each of the foregoing (acting in
such capacity) shall neither have nor incur any liability to any Person or
Entity for any act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or related to
the formulation, preparation, dissemination, implementation, administration,
Confirmation or Consummation of the Plan, the Disclosure Statement or any
contract, instrument, release or other agreement or document created or entered
into in connection with the Plan or any other act taken or omitted to be taken
in connection with or in contemplation of the restructuring of the Debtors.

          5.   Preservation of Rights of Action

               (a)  The Debtors' Retained Causes of Action

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors
shall retain all rights to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all
Causes of Action, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, in any
court or other tribunal including, without limitation, in an adversary
proceeding Filed in one or more of the Chapter 11 Cases, including the actions
specified on Exhibit G of the Disclosure Statement.

          The Debtors have reviewed available information regarding Causes of
Action against other parties or entities, which investigation has not been
completed and is ongoing, except with respect to compromises and settlements
under the Plan. In addition, due to the size and scope of the Debtors' business
operations and the multitude of business transactions therein, there may be
numerous other Causes of Actions which currently exist or may subsequently
arise, in addition to the matters identified below. The Debtors are also
continuing to investigate and assess which Causes of Action may be pursued. The
Debtors do not intend, and it should not be assumed that because any existing or
potential claims or Causes of Action have not yet been pursued by the Debtors or
do not fall within the list below, that any such claims or Causes or Action have
been waived. Under the Plan, the Debtors retain all rights to pursue any and all
Causes of Action to the extent the Debtors, deem appropriate (under any theory
of law, including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable
local, state, or federal law, in any court or other tribunal, including, without
limitation, in an adversary proceeding Filed in the Chapter 11 Cases),
including, without limitation:

                    (i)    Objections to Claims under the Plan

                    (ii)   Any and all litigation or Causes of Action of the
                           Debtors relating to the Causes of Action listed on
                           Exhibit G

                    (iii)  Any other litigation or Causes of Action, whether
                           legal, equitable or statutory in nature, arising out
                           of, or in connection with the Debtors' businesses,
                           assets or operations or otherwise affecting the
                           Debtors, including, without limitation, possible
                           claims against the following types of parties for the
                           following types of claims:

                                 perform under contracts with the Debtors before
                                 the assumption or rejection of the subject

               (b)  Preservation of All Causes of Action Not Expressly Settled
                    or Released

          Unless a Claim or Cause of Action against a Creditor or other Person
is expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in the Plan
or any Final Order, the Debtors expressly reserve such Claim or Cause of Action
for later adjudication by the Debtors, and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine,
including, without limitation, the doctrines of res judicata, collateral
estoppel, issue preclusion, Claim preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial,
equitable or otherwise) or laches shall apply to such Claims or Causes of Action
upon or after the confirmation or Consummation of the Plan based on the
Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the Confirmation Order, except where such
Claims or Causes of Action have been waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled in the Plan or a Final Order. In addition, the Debtors and the
successor entities under the Plan expressly reserve the right to pursue or adopt
any Claims not so waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled that is
alleged in any lawsuit in which the Debtors are a defendant or an interested
party, against any person or entity, including, without limitation, the
plaintiffs or co-defendants in such lawsuits.

          Any Person to whom the Debtors have incurred an obligation (whether on
account of services, purchase or sale of goods or otherwise), or who has
received services from the Debtors or a transfer of money or property of the
Debtors, or who has transacted business with the Debtors, or leased equipment or
property from the Debtors should assume that such obligation, transfer, or
transaction may be reviewed by the Debtors subsequent to the Effective Date and
may, to the extent not theretofore waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled, be the subject of an action after the Effective Date, whether or not
(i) such Person has Filed a proof of Claim against the Debtors in the Chapter 11
Cases; (ii) such Person's proof of Claim has been objected to; (iii) such
Person's Claim was included in the Debtors' Schedules; or (iv) such Person's
scheduled Claim has been objected to by the Debtors or has been identified by
the Debtors as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated.

          6.   Discharge of Claims and Termination of Equity Interests

          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, and except with respect to
the Liquidating Debtors: (1) the rights afforded in the Plan and the treatment
of all Claims and Equity Interests in the Plan shall be in exchange for and in
complete satisfaction, discharge and release of Claims and Equity Interests of
any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued on Claims from and after
the Petition Date, against the Reorganizing or Reorganized Debtors or any of
their assets or properties, (2) on the Effective Date, all such Claims against,
and Equity Interests in, the Reorganizing or Reorganized Debtors shall be
satisfied, discharged and released in full and (3) all Persons and Entities
shall be precluded from asserting against the Reorganizing or Reorganized
Debtors, their successors or their assets or properties any other or further
Claims or Equity Interests based upon any act or omission, transaction or other
activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Confirmation Date.

          7.   Injunction

          Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or obligations
issued pursuant to the Plan, all Persons who have held, hold or may hold Claims
or Equity Interests in the Reorganizing Debtors are permanently enjoined, from
and after the Effective Date, from (a) commencing or continuing in any manner
any action or other proceeding of any kind on any such Claim or Equity Interest
against the Reorganized Debtors; (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting or
recovering by any manner or means any judgment, award, decree or order against
the Reorganized Debtors; (c) creating, perfecting, or enforcing any encumbrance
of any kind against the Reorganized Debtors; (d) asserting any right of setoff,
subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any obligation due from the
Reorganizing Debtors or against the property of the Reorganizing Debtors, their
estates or the Reorganized Debtors with respect to any such Claim or Equity
Interest; and (e) commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other
proceeding of any kind in respect of any Claim or Cause of Action released or

M.        RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

jurisdiction to:

               (a) allow, disallow, determine, liquidate, classify, estimate or

Interests), assumption or rejection of executory contracts or leases affected by
the Plan, and any document or agreement executed pursuant hereto, shall be
deemed null and void, and (c) nothing contained in the Plan shall (i) constitute
a waiver or release of any Claims by or against, or any Equity Interests in,
such Debtor or any other Person, (ii) prejudice in any manner the rights of such
Debtor or any other Person, or (iii) constitute an admission of any sort by such
Debtor or any other Person.

          7.   Successors and Assigns

estate transfer tax, mortgage recording tax or other similar tax or governmental
assessment in the United States, and the Confirmation Order shall direct the
appropriate state or local governmental officials or agents to forgo the

                        VOTING AND CONFIRMATION PROCEDURE

          The following is a brief summary regarding the acceptance and
confirmation of the Plan. Holders of Claims and Equity Interests are encouraged
to review the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and/or to consult their
own attorneys. Additional information regarding voting procedures is set forth
in the Notices accompanying this Disclosure Statement.

A.        VOTING INSTRUCTIONS

          This Disclosure Statement, accompanied by a Ballot to be used for
voting on the Plan, is being distributed to Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests in Classes 4A, 5A-1, 5A-2, 6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1, 11A-2, 12A, 4B-1,
4B-2, 5B and 6B. Only Holders in these Classes are entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan and may do so by completing the Ballot and returning it in the
envelope provided. Beneficial owners who receive a return envelope addressed to
their Nominee should allow enough time for their vote to be received by the
Nominee and processed on a Master Ballot. In light of the benefits of the Plan
for each Class of Claims and Equity Interests, the Debtors recommend that
Holders of Claims and Equity Interests in each of the Impaired Classes vote to
accept the Plan and return the Ballot.

ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME FOR YOUR VOTE TO BE PROCESSED BY THE NOMINEE AND VOTED ON

THE APPLICABLE INTERMEDIARY OR THE SOLICITATION AGENT. ANY BALLOT, OR MASTER
BALLOT VOTED BY YOUR NOMINEE ON YOUR BEHALF, RECEIVED AFTER THE VOTING DEADLINE
MAY NOT BE COUNTED.

          ANY BALLOT WHICH IS EXECUTED BY THE HOLDER OF AN ALLOWED CLAIM OR
EQUITY INTEREST OR ANY COMBINATION OF BALLOTS REPRESENTING CLAIMS OR EQUITY
INTERESTS IN THE SAME CLASS HELD BY THE SAME HOLDER BUT WHICH DOES NOT INDICATE
AN ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN OR WHICH INDICATES BOTH AN ACCEPTANCE AND
A REJECTION OF THE PLAN SHALL BE DEEMED AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN.

          The Debtors will publish the Confirmation Hearing Notice in the
national edition of The Wall Street Journal, the national edition of The USA
Today, Chicago Tribune, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Indianapolis Star, and St.
Paul Pioneer Press, which will contain the Plan Objection Deadline and
Confirmation Hearing, in order to provide notification to persons who may not
otherwise receive notice by mail.

For all Holders:

          By signing and returning a Ballot, each Holder of Claims and Equity
Interests in Classes 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 10A, 11A, 12A, 4B, 5B and 6B will also
be certifying to the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtors that, among other things:

          o such Holder has received and reviewed a copy of the Disclosure
          Statement and related Ballot and/or Master Ballot and acknowledges
          that the solicitation is being made pursuant to the terms and
          conditions set forth in the Plan;

          o such Holder has cast the same vote on every Ballot completed by such
          Holder with respect to holdings of such Class of Claims or Equity
          Interests;

          o no other Ballots with respect to such Class of Claims or Equity
          Interests have been cast or, if any other Ballots have been cast with
          respect to such Class of Claims or Equity Interests, such earlier
          Ballots are thereby revoked;

                                      -77-
<PAGE>


          o the Debtors have made available to such Holder or its agents all
          documents and information relating to the Plan and related matters
          reasonably requested by or on behalf of such Holder; and

          o except for information provided by the Debtors in writing, and by
          its own agents, such Holder has not relied on any statements made or
          other information received from any person with respect to the Plan.

          By signing and returning a Ballot, each Holder of Claims and Equity
Interests also acknowledges that the securities being distributed pursuant to
the Plan are not being distributed pursuant to a registration statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with any securities authority
outside of the United States and represents that any such securities will be
acquired for its own account and not with a view to any distribution of such
securities in violation of the Securities Act. It is expected that when issued
pursuant to the Plan, except with respect to entities deemed to be underwriters,
such securities will be exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act by virtue of section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code and may be
resold by the Holders thereof subject to the provisions of section 1145.

B.        VOTING TABULATION

          In tabulating votes, the following rules shall be used to determine
the claim amount associated with a creditor's vote:

          o If the Debtors do not object to a claim, the claim amount for voting
          purposes shall be the claim amount contained on a timely filed proof
          of claim or, if no proof of claim was filed, the non-contingent,
          liquidated and undisputed claim amount listed in the Debtors'
          schedules of liabilities.

          o If the Debtors object to a claim, such creditor's Ballot shall not
          be counted in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a), unless
          temporarily allowed by the Court for voting purposes, after notice and
          a hearing.

          o If a creditor casts a Ballot and is listed on the Debtors' schedules
          of liabilities as holding a claim that is contingent, unliquidated or
          disputed, such creditor's Ballot shall not be counted in accordance
          with Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a), unless temporarily allowed by the Court
          for voting purposes, after notice and a hearing.

          o If a creditor believes that it should be entitled to vote on the
          Plan, then such creditor must serve on the Debtors and file with the
          Court a motion for an order pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a) (a
          "Rule 3018(a) Motion") seeking temporary allowance for voting
          purposes. Such Rule 3018(a) Motion, with evidence in support thereof,
          must be filed by the Plan Objection Deadline.

          o Ballots cast by creditors whose claims are not listed on the
          Debtors' schedules of liabilities, but who timely file proofs of claim
          in unliquidated or unknown amounts that are not the subject of an
          objection filed before the commencement of the Confirmation Hearing,
          will count for satisfying the numerosity requirement of section
          1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and will count as ballots for claims in
          the amount of $1.00 solely for the purpose of satisfying the dollar
          amount provisions of section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o In the case of publicly-held securities, the principal amount or
          number of shares according to the records of the transfer agent for
          the particular series of securities, including a further breakdown, in
          the case of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), of the individual
          nominee holders which are DTC participants, as of the Voting Record
          Date, shall be the claim or interest amount, except that in no event
          shall a nominee holder be permitted to vote in excess of its position
          in DTC as of the Voting Record Date.

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

          The Claim amount or Equity Interest amount established through the
above process controls for voting purposes only and does not constitute the
Allowed amount of any Claim or Equity Interest for distribution purposes.

          To ensure that its vote is counted, each Holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest must (a) complete a Ballot; (b) indicate the Holder's decision either
to accept or reject the Plan in the boxes provided in the respective Ballot; and
(c) sign and return the Ballot to the address set forth on the envelope enclosed
therewith (if included).

          The Ballot does not constitute, and shall not be deemed to be, a Proof
of Claim or Equity Interest or an assertion or admission of a Claim or Equity
Interest.

          If a Holder holds Claims or Equity Interests in more than one Class
under the Plan, the Holder may receive more than one Ballot coded for each Class
of Claims or Equity Interests held by such Holder.

          Creditors shall not split their vote within a claim; thus, each
creditor shall be deemed to have voted the full amount of its claims or equity
interests either to accept or reject the Plan.

          Except to the extent the Debtors so determine or as permitted by the
Bankruptcy Court, Ballots received after the Voting Deadline will not be
accepted or counted by the Debtors in connection with the Debtors' request for
confirmation of the Plan. The method of delivery of Ballots to be sent to the
Solicitation Agent is at the election and risk of each Holder of a Claim or
Equity Interest. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, such delivery will be
deemed made only when the original executed Ballot is actually received by the
Solicitation Agent. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to assure
timely delivery. Original executed Ballots or Master Ballots are required.
Delivery of a Ballot or Master Ballot by facsimile, e-mail or any other
electronic means will not be accepted. No Ballot or Master Ballot should be sent
to the Debtors, any indenture trustee, or the Debtors' financial or legal
advisors. The Debtors expressly reserve the right to amend, at any time and from
time to time, the terms of the Plan (subject to compliance with the requirements
of section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code). If the Debtors make material changes in
the terms of the Plan or if the Debtors waive a material condition, the Debtors
will disseminate additional solicitation materials and will extend the
solicitation, in each case to the extent directed by the Bankruptcy Court.

          If multiple Ballots or Master Ballots are received from or on behalf
of an individual Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest with respect to the same
claims or equity interests prior to the Voting Deadline, the last ballot timely
received will be deemed to reflect the voter's intent and to supersede and
revoke any prior ballot.

          If a Ballot or Master Ballot is signed by a trustee, executor,
administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation, or other
person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such person shall be
required to indicate such capacity when signing and, unless otherwise determined
by the Debtors, must submit proper evidence satisfactory to the Debtors to so
act on behalf of a beneficial interest holder.

          The Debtors, in their sole discretion, subject to contrary order of
the Bankruptcy Court, may waive any defect in any Ballot or Master Ballot at any
time, either before or after the close of voting, and without notice. Except as
otherwise provided herein, unless the Ballot or Master Ballot being furnished is
timely submitted on or prior to the Voting Deadline, the Debtors may, in their
sole discretion, reject such Ballot or Master Ballot as invalid and, therefore,
not count it in connection with confirmation of the Plan.

          In the event a designation is requested under section 1126(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code, any vote to accept or reject the Plan cast with respect to such
Claim or Equity Interest will not be counted for purposes of determining whether
the Plan has been accepted or rejected, unless the Bankruptcy Court orders
otherwise.

          Any holder of impaired claims or equity interests who has delivered a
valid Ballot voting on the Plan may withdraw such vote solely in accordance with
Bankruptcy Rule 3018(a).

                                      -79-
<PAGE>

          The Debtors' interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Plan
shall be final and binding on all parties, unless otherwise directed by the
Bankruptcy Court.

          Subject to any contrary order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors
reserve the absolute right to reject any and all Ballots and Master Ballots not
proper in form, the acceptance of which would, in the opinion of the Debtors or
their counsel, not be in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
Subject to any contrary order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors further
reserve the right to waive any defects or irregularities or conditions of
delivery as to any particular Ballot or Master Ballot unless otherwise directed
by the Bankruptcy Court. Neither the Debtors, nor any other person or entity,
will be under any duty to provide notification of defects or irregularities with
respect to deliveries of Ballots or Master Ballots nor will any of them incur
any liabilities for failure to provide such notification. Unless otherwise
directed by the Court, delivery of such Ballots or Master Ballots will not be
deemed to have been made until such irregularities have been cured or waived.
Ballots and Master Ballots previously furnished (as to which any irregularities
have not theretofor been cured or waived) will not be counted.

C.        VOTING PROCEDURES

          The Voting Record Date for purposes of determining which Holders of
Claims and Equity Interests are entitled to vote on the Plan is ___________,
2003.

          1.   Beneficial Holders

          Any Beneficial Holder of Claims and Equity Interests holding as a
record holder in its own name, shall vote on the Plan by completing and signing
the Ballot and returning it to the Solicitation Agent.

          Any Beneficial Holder of Claims and Equity Interests who holds in
"street name" through a Nominee shall vote on the Plan either (i) if the Nominee
has provided a prevalidated Ballot, by completing and signing the prevalidated
Ballot and returning it directly to the Solicitation Agent or (ii) by promptly
completing and signing the Ballot and returning it to the Nominee in sufficient
time to allow the Nominee to process the Ballot and return a Master Ballot to
the Solicitation Agent by the Voting Deadline.

          Any Ballot returned to a Nominee by a Beneficial Holder will not be
counted for purposes of accepting or rejecting the Plan until such Nominee
properly completes and delivers to the Solicitation Agent a Master Ballot that
reflects the vote of such Beneficial Holder.

          2.   Nominees

          Because of the complexity and difficulty associated with reaching
beneficial owners of publicly traded securities, many of which hold their
securities in brokerage accounts and through several layers of ownership, the
Debtors are distributing a Ballot (a) to each record holder of the Secured Note
Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old
CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests as of the
Voting Record Date (as discussed in Section VII.C.1 above) and (b) an
appropriate number of copies to each bank or brokerage firm (or the agent or
other Nominee therefor) identified by the Solicitation Agent as an entity
through which beneficial owners hold the Secured Note Claims, Exchange Note
Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock
Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests. Each Nominee will be requested to
immediately distribute a copy of this Disclosure Statement and accompanying
materials including the Ballots to all Beneficial Holders for which it holds the
Secured Note Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related
Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests.
Each Nominee must summarize the individual votes of its respective individual
Beneficial Holders from their individual Beneficial Holders' Ballots on a Master
Ballot and shall return such Master Ballot to the Solicitation Agent. These
procedures will enable the Debtors to transmit materials to the Holders of its
publicly traded securities and afford Beneficial Holders of the Secured Note
Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old
CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests a fair and
reasonable opportunity to vote. In order for votes to be counted, all Ballots
and Master Ballots received from the Debtors must be returned to the
Solicitation Agent by the Voting Deadline as indicated on the Ballots.

                                      -80-

          A Nominee may also pre-validate a Ballot for Holders of Secured Note
Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old
CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests by completing
all the information to be entered on the Ballot (the "Pre-Validated Ballot") and
forwarding the Pre-Validated Ballot to the Beneficial Holder for voting. The
Ballot may then be delivered directly to the Solicitation Agent in the return
envelope provided with the Ballot.

          If a Beneficial Holder holds Secured Note Claims, Exchange Note
Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock
Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests or any combination thereof through
more than one Nominee, such Beneficial Holder should execute a separate Ballot
for each block of Secured Note Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note
Claims, Trust Related Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC
Common Stock Interests that it holds through any Nominee and (unless the ballot
was "prevalidated") return the Ballot to the respective Nominee that holds the
Secured Note Claims, Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Trust Related
Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock Interests and Old CNC Common Stock Interests.

          If a Beneficial Holder holds a portion of its Secured Note Claims,
Exchange Note Claims, Original Note Claims, Old CNC Preferred Stock Interests
and Old CNC Common Stock Interests through a Nominee and another portion
directly or in its own name as the record holder, such Beneficial Holder should
follow the procedures described in Section VII.C.1 above to vote the portion
held in its own name and the procedures described in Section VII.C.2 above to
vote the portion held by the Nominee or Nominees.

D.        THE CONFIRMATION HEARING

          Section 1128(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires the Bankruptcy Court,
after notice, to hold a hearing on confirmation of the Plan (the "Confirmation
Hearing"). Section 1128(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that any
party-in-interest may object to confirmation of the Plan.

          The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled the Confirmation Hearing for
[__________], 2003 before the Honorable Carol A. Doyle, United States Bankruptcy
Judge, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, located at the Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, 219 S. Dearborn,
Chicago, Illinois 60604, Courtroom ____. The Confirmation Hearing may be
adjourned from time to time by the Bankruptcy Court without further notice
except for an announcement of the adjourned date made at the Confirmation
Hearing or any adjournment thereof.

          Objections to confirmation of the Plan must be filed and served on or
before [__________], 2003 in accordance with the Confirmation Hearing Notice
accompanying this Disclosure Statement. UNLESS OBJECTIONS TO CONFIRMATION ARE
TIMELY SERVED AND FILED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPROVAL ORDER, THEY WILL NOT BE
CONSIDERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

E.        STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

          At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court shall determine
whether the requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Court have been
satisfied. If so, the Bankruptcy Court shall enter the Confirmation Order. The
Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies or will satisfy the applicable
requirements, as follows:

          o The Plan complies with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
          Code.

          o The Debtors, as Plan proponent, will have complied with the
          applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o The Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means
          forbidden by law.

          o Any payment made or promised under the Plan for services or for
          costs and expenses in, or in connection with, this Bankruptcy Case, or
          in connection with the Plan and incident to

                                      -81-
<PAGE>

          the case, has been disclosed to the Bankruptcy Court, and any such
          payment made before the confirmation of the Plan is reasonable, or if
          such payment is to be fixed after the confirmation of the Plan, such
          payment is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court as
          reasonable.

          o With respect to each Class of Impaired Claims or Equity Interests,
          either each Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest of such Class has
          accepted the Plan, or will receive or retain under the Plan on account
          of such Claim or Equity Interest, property of a value, as of the
          Effective Date of the Plan, that is not less than the amount that such
          Holder would receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated on such
          date under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o Each Class of Claims or Equity Interests that is entitled to vote on
          the Plan has either accepted the Plan or is not impaired under the
          Plan, or the Plan can be confirmed without the approval of each voting
          Class pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          o Except to the extent that the Holder of a particular Claim will
          agree to a different treatment of such Claim, the Plan provides that
          Allowed Administrative, Allowed Priority Tax Claims and Allowed Other
          Priority Claims will be paid in full on the Effective Date, or as soon
          thereafter as practicable.

          o At least one Class of Impaired Claims or Equity Interests will
          accept the Plan, determined without including any acceptance of the
          Plan by any insider holding a Claim of such Class.

          o Confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the
          liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the
          Debtors or any successor to the Debtors under the Plan, unless such
          liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the Plan.

          o All fees of the type described in 28 U.S.C.ss. 1930, including the
          fees of the United States Trustee, will be paid as of the Effective
          Date.

          o The Plan addresses payment of retiree benefits in accordance with
          Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          The Debtors believe that (a) the Plan satisfies or will satisfy all of
the statutory requirements of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) they have
complied or will have complied with all of the requirements of Chapter 11 and
(c) the Plan has been proposed in good faith.

          1.   Best Interests of Creditors Test/Liquidation Analysis

          Before the Plan may be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Court must find (with
certain exceptions) that the Plan provides, with respect to each Class, that
each Holder of a Claim or Equity Interest in such Class either (a) has accepted
the Plan or (b) will receive or retain under the Plan property of a value, as of
the Effective Date, that is not less than the amount that such person would
receive or retain if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

          In chapter 7 liquidation cases, unsecured creditors and interest
holders of a debtor are paid from available assets generally in the following
order, with no lower Class receiving any payments until all amounts due to
senior Classes have been paid fully or payment provided for:

          o Secured creditors (to the extent of the value of their collateral).

          o Priority creditors.

          o Unsecured creditors.

          o Debt expressly subordinated by its terms or by order of the
          Bankruptcy Court.

                                      -82-
<PAGE>


          o Equity Interest Holders.

            (a) Liquidation Analysis of CNC and CIHC

          As described in more detail in the Liquidation Analysis set forth on
Exhibit A attached hereto, the Debtors believe that the value of any
distributions in a chapter 7 case would be less than the value of distributions
under the Plan because, among other reasons, such distributions in a chapter 7
case may not occur for a longer period of time thereby reducing the present
value of such distributions. In this regard, it is possible that distribution of
the proceeds of a liquidation could be delayed for a period in order for a
chapter 7 trustee and its professionals to become knowledgeable about the
Bankruptcy Case and the Claims against the Debtors. In addition, proceeds
received in a chapter 7 liquidation are likely to be significantly discounted
due to the distressed nature of the sale, and the fees and expenses of a chapter
7 trustee would likely exceed those of the Estate Representative (thereby
further reducing Cash available for distribution).

            (b) Liquidation Analysis of PHG and CTIHC

          PHG and CTIHC believe that the value of any distributions in a chapter
7 case would be less than the value of distributions under their respective
Subplans.

          On January 2, 2003, PHG filed its schedules and statement of financial
affairs. In those documents, PHG disclosed that it has no assets, and $105,955
of unsecured liabilities owed to CIHC. PHG's Subplan provides that CIHC will
receive no distribution on account of this claim, and CIHC has consented to this
treatment.

          On January 2, 2003, CTIHC filed its schedules and statement of
financial affairs. In those documents, CTIHC discloses that it has liquid assets
of $2,607, an intercompany claim of unknown value and potential causes of
action. Although CTIHC is a named defendant in a pending lawsuit, CTIHC's
liabilities are unknown at this time. CTIHC's Subplan proposes that if an
unsecured claim is allowed against CTIHC, then such creditor will receive the
stock of CTIHC.

          PHG's and CTIHC's schedules are available at www.bmccorp.net/conseco
or by contacting the Debtors' notice agent at 1-888-909-0100.

          2.   Financial Feasibility

          The Bankruptcy Code requires the Bankruptcy Court to find, as a
condition to confirmation, that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the
liquidation of Debtors or the need for further financial reorganization, unless
such liquidation is contemplated by the Plan. For purposes of showing that the
Plan meets this feasibility standard, the Debtors, together with Lazard, have
analyzed (taking into account the Company's Projections) the ability of the
Reorganized Debtors to meet its obligations under the Plan and to retain
sufficient liquidity and capital resources to conduct its businesses.

          The Debtors believe that with a significantly deleveraged capital
structure, the Company's business will be able to return to viability. The
decrease in the amount of debt on the Company's balance sheet will substantially
reduce its interest expense, improving its cash flow. Based on the terms of the
Plan, at emergence the Company will have $1.4 billion of debt in contrast to
more than $6.4 billion of debt and Trust Preferred Securities obligations prior
to the restructuring.

          The Projections indicate that the Company should have sufficient cash
flow to pay and service its debt obligations and to fund its operations.
Accordingly, the Debtors believe that the Plan complies with the financial
feasibility standard of section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code.

          3.   Acceptance by Impaired Classes

          The Bankruptcy Code requires, as a condition to confirmation, that
each Class of Claims or Equity Interests that is impaired under the Plan accept
the Plan, with the exception described in the following section. A Class that is
not "impaired" under a plan of reorganization is deemed to have accepted the
plan

                                      -83-
<PAGE>

and, therefore, solicitation of acceptances with respect to such Class is not
required. A Class is "impaired" unless the plan (a) leaves unaltered the legal,
equitable and contractual rights to which the Claim or Equity Interest entitles
the Holder of such Claim or Equity Interest or (b) cures any default and
reinstates the original terms of the obligation.

          4.   Confirmation Without Acceptance by All Impaired Classes

          Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code allows a Bankruptcy Court to
confirm a plan, even if such plan has not been accepted by all Impaired Classes
entitled to vote on such plan, provided that such plan has been accepted by at
least one Impaired Class.

          Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code states that notwithstanding the
failure of an Impaired Class to accept a plan of reorganization, the plan shall
be confirmed, on request of the proponent of the plan, in a procedure commonly
known as "cram-down," so long as the plan does not "discriminate unfairly," and
is "fair and equitable" with respect to each Class of Claims or Equity Interests
that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

          In general, a plan does not discriminate unfairly if it provides a
treatment to the class that is substantially equivalent to the treatment that is
provided to other classes that have equal rank. In determining whether a plan
discriminates unfairly, courts will take into account a number of factors,
including the effect of applicable subordination agreements between parties.
Accordingly, two classes of unsecured creditors could be treated differently
without unfairly discriminating against either class.

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of secured claims includes the requirements that (a) the
Holders of such secured claims retain the liens securing such Claims to the
extent of the allowed amount of the Claims, whether the property subject to the
liens is retained by debtor or transferred to another entity under the plan and
(b) each Holder of a secured claim in the Class receives deferred Cash payments
totaling at least the allowed amount of such Claim with a present value, as of
the effective date of the plan, at least equivalent to the value of the secured
claimant's interest in the debtor's property subject to the liens.

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of unsecured claims includes the following requirement that
either: (a) the plan provides that each Holder of a Claim of such Class receive
or retain on account of such Claim property of a value, as of the effective date
of the plan, equal to the allowed amount of such Claim; or (b) the Holder of any
Claim or Equity Interest that is junior to the Claims of such Class will not
receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior Claim or Equity
Interest any property.

          The condition that a plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to a
non-accepting Class of Equity Interests includes the requirements that either:
(a) the plan provide that each Holder of an Equity Interest in such Class
receive or retain under the plan, on account of such Equity Interest, property
of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the greater of (i)
the allowed amount of any fixed liquidation preference to which such Holder is
entitled, (ii) any fixed redemption price to which such Holder is entitled or
(iii) the value of such interest; or (b) if the Class does not receive such an
amount as required under (a), no Class of Equity Interests junior to the
non-accepting Class may receive a distribution under the plan.

                                     VIII.
                                  RISK FACTORS

HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS SHOULD READ AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE
FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, AS WELL AS THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TOGETHER HEREWITH, REFERRED TO
OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN, PRIOR TO VOTING TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE
PLAN. THESE FACTORS SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING THE ONLY
RISKS INVOLVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

A.        CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY CONSIDERATIONS

The Bankruptcy Filing May Further Disrupt Our Operations and the Operations of
Our Subsidiaries.

          The impact that the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our operations and
the operations of our subsidiaries cannot be accurately predicted or quantified.
Since the announcement of our intention to seek a restructuring of our capital
in August 2002 and the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have suffered
significant disruptions in our operations. Our leveraged condition and liquidity
difficulties have eliminated CFC's access to the securitization markets, which
have historically served as CFC's main source of funding. As a result, CFC has
had to terminate the origination of loans which it is unable to sell profitably
in the whole-loan market. In addition, insurance regulators in each of the
states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have been monitoring
the Company's activities associated with its financial restructuring. Our two
insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas each entered into consent orders with
the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas, which, among other things,
has limited their ability to pay dividends without regulatory approval and to
make disbursements other than in the ordinary course of business. In August
2002, A.M. Best further downgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary
insurance subsidiaries to "B (fair)." These ratings downgrades and other adverse
publicity concerning the Company's financial condition have caused sales of our
insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase. In some cases, we have experienced defections among our sales force of
agents and/or have increased commissions in order to retain them.

          The continuation of the Chapter 11 Cases, particularly if the Plan is
not approved or confirmed in the time frame currently contemplated, could
further adversely affect our operations and relationship with our customers,
employees, regulators, distributors and agents. If confirmation and consummation
of the Plan do not occur expeditiously, the Chapter 11 Cases could result in,
among other things, increased costs for professional fees and similar expenses.
In addition, prolonged Chapter 11 Cases may make it more difficult to retain and
attract management and other key personnel and would require senior management
to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with our financial
reorganization instead of focusing on the operation of our business.

We May Not Be Able to Obtain Confirmation of the Plan.

          We cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite acceptances to
confirm the Plan. Even if we receive the requisite acceptances, we cannot assure
you that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan. A non-accepting creditor or
equity holder might challenge the adequacy of this Disclosure Statement or the
balloting procedures and results as not being in compliance with the Bankruptcy
Code or Bankruptcy Rules. Even if the Bankruptcy Court determined that the
Disclosure Statement and the balloting procedures and results were appropriate,
the Bankruptcy Court could still decline to confirm the Plan if it found that
any of the statutory requirements for confirmation had not been met, including
that the terms of the Plan are fair and equitable to non-accepting Classes.
Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the requirements for confirmation
and requires, among other things, (i) a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the
Plan "does not unfairly discriminate" and is "fair and equitable" with respect
to any non-accepting Classes, (ii) confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be
followed by a liquidation or a need for further financial reorganization and
(iii) the value of distributions to non-accepting Holders of claims and
interests within a particular Class under the Plan will not be less than the
value of distributions such Holders would receive if the Company were liquidated
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. While there can be no assurance that
these requirements will be met, we believe that the Plan will not be followed by
a need for further financial reorganization and that non-accepting Holders
within each Class under the Plan will receive distributions at least as great as
would be received following a liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code
when taking into consideration all administrative claims and costs associated
with any such chapter 7 case. We believe that Holders of Equity Interests in
Conseco would receive no distribution under either a liquidation pursuant to
chapter 7 or chapter 11.

          The confirmation and consummation of the Plan are also subject to
certain conditions described in Section VI.L above. If the Plan is not
confirmed, it is unclear whether a restructuring of Conseco could be implemented
and what distributions Holders of Claims or Equity Interests ultimately would
receive with

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

respect to their Claims or Equity Interests. If an alternative reorganization
could not be agreed to, it is possible that we would have to liquidate our
assets, in which case it is likely that Holders of Claims and Equity Interests
would receive substantially less favorable treatment than they would receive
under the Plan.

The Bankruptcy Court May Not Subordinate Certain Litigation Under Section 510(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code.

          As described in Section VI.H above, eight purported securities fraud
class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana. The Debtors will seek to subordinate the
claims related to these lawsuits under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. If
these claims are not subordinated, then they would be treated as General
Unsecured Claims. The maximum exposure to the Debtors from these lawsuits is
estimated to be approximately $275 million.

          As described in Section VI.H above, in October 2002, Roderick Russell,
on behalf of himself and a class of persons similarly situated, and on behalf of
the ConsecoSavePlan, filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana against CNC, Conseco Services and certain current
and former officers of CNC (Roderick Russell, et al. v Conseco, Inc., et al,
Case No. I :02-CV -1639 LJM). The purported class action consists of all
individuals whose 401(k) accounts held common stock of CNC at any time from
April 28, 1999 through the present. The Debtors will seek to subordinate the
claims related to this lawsuit under section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. If
these claims are not subordinated, then they would be treated as General
Unsecured Claims. The maximum exposure to the Debtors from this lawsuit is
estimated to be approximately $53 million.

Our Valuation of Reorganized CNC May Be Challenged.

          The Debtors believe based on, among other things, the valuation
included herein, that the approximate midpoint enterprise value of Reorganized
CNC is $3.8 billion. This is significantly less than the value that would be
required to provide a recovery to the holders of Trust Preferred Securities or
the equity securities of CNC. The holders of the Trust Preferred Securities and
the holders of equity securities of CNC, among others, may oppose confirmation
of the Plan alleging that value of Reorganized CNC is higher than $3.8 billion
and that the Plan thereby improperly extinguish their rights to recoveries under
the Plan. At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will hear evidence
regarding the views of the Debtors and opposing parties (if any) with respect to
the valuation of Reorganized CNC. Based on that evidence, the Bankruptcy Court
will determine the appropriate valuation for Reorganized CNC for purposes of the
Plan. The Debtors believe that $3.8 billion is the appropriate valuation. We
cannot, however, assure you that the Bankruptcy Court will adopt our valuation
of Reorganized CNC.

General Unsecured Claims Against CNC or CIHC May Be Diluted.

          Under the Reorganizing Subplans, the Reorganizing Debtors propose to
distribute all or substantially all of the New CNC Common Stock to Holders of
Original Note Claims, Exchange Note Claims and Reorganizing Debtor General
Unsecured Claims. Disputed litigation claims, however, may materially impact the
amount of General Unsecured Claims against CNC and CIHC. In addition, there may
be other Claims asserted by unknown parties. If such Claims are Allowed, they
will dilute the percentage of shares distributed to Holders of Original Note
Claims, Exchange Note Claims and Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

Parties in Interest May Object to Our Classification of Claims.

          Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan of
reorganization may place a class or an interest in a particular class only if
such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other claims or interests
in such class. We believe that the classification of claims and interests under
the Plan complies with the requirements set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.
However, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same
conclusion.

                                      -86-
<PAGE>


We May Object to the Amount or Classification of a Claim.

         We reserve the right to object to the amount or classification of any
Claim or Equity Interest. The estimates set forth in this Disclosure Statement
cannot be relied on by any creditor or equityholder whose Claim or Equity
Interest is subject to an objection. Any such Holder of a Claim or Equity
Interest may not receive its specified share of the estimated distributions
described in this Disclosure Statement.

B.        FACTORS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE
          PLAN

We May Not Be Able to Achieve Our Projected Financial Results.

          We may not be able to meet our projected financial results or achieve
the revenue or cash flow that we have assumed in projecting our future business
prospects. If we do not achieve these projected revenue or cash flow levels, we
may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned after the
Effective Date. Our financial projections represent management's view based on
currently known facts and hypothetical assumptions about our future operations.
However, the Projections set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto do not guarantee
our future financial performance.

The Plan Exchanges Senior Securities for Junior Securities.

          If the Plan is confirmed and consummated, holders of Original Notes
and Exchange Notes will, and holders of Secured Notes may, receive shares of New
CNC Common Stock, and the Lenders will receive shares of New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants. Thus, in agreeing to the Plan, the Lenders and holders of
Original Notes and Exchange Notes will be consenting to the exchange of their
interests in senior debt, which has a stated interest rate, a maturity date, a
liquidation preference over equity securities and, in the case of the Lenders
and holders of the Exchange Notes, a guaranty, for shares of New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Warrants or New CNC Common Stock, as applicable, which will be
subordinate to all creditor claims, and, in the case of New CNC Common Stock and
New CNC Warrants, the claims of holders of New CNC Preferred Stock.

A Liquid Trading Market for the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock
and New CNC Warrants May Not Develop.

          Although the Company intends to apply to list the New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants on a national securities
exchange or NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
listings or, even if we do, that liquid trading markets for the New CNC
Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants will develop. The
liquidity of any market for the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock
and New CNC Warrants will depend, among other things, upon the number of Holders
of New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants, our
financial performance, and the market for similar securities, none of which can
be determined or predicted. Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active
trading market will develop or, if a market develops, what the liquidity or
pricing characteristics of that market will be.

The Trading Price For the New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New
CNC Warrants May Be Depressed Following the Effective Date.

          Assuming consummation of the Plan, the New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants will be issued substantially
simultaneously to Holders of Claims and Equity Interests who had originally
purchased other securities of the Company or who purchased such securities
before the need for the financial restructuring of the Company became manifest.
Following the Effective Date, such Holders may seek to dispose of the New CNC
Preferred Stock, New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Warrants in an effort to
obtain liquidity, which could cause the initial trading prices for these
securities to be depressed, particularly in light of the lack of established
trading markets for these securities.

                                      -87-
<PAGE>

The Estimated Valuation of Reorganized CNC and the New CNC Preferred Stock and
New CNC Common Stock, and the Estimated Recoveries to Holders of Claims and
Equity Interests, is Not Intended to Represent the Trading Values of the New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Common Stock.

          The estimated valuation of the Company set forth in Section II.J
above, prepared by Lazard at the request of the Company and based on the
Projections developed by the Company's management, is based on commonly accepted
valuation analyses and is not intended to represent the trading values of
Reorganized CNC's securities in public or private markets. This valuation
analysis is based on numerous assumptions (the realization of many of which is
beyond our control), including, among other things, our successful
reorganization, an assumed Effective Date of June 1, 2003, our ability to
achieve the operating and financial results included in the Projections, our
ability to maintain adequate liquidity to fund operations and the assumption
that capital and equity markets remain consistent with current conditions. Even
if we achieve the Projections, the trading market values for the New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Common Stock could be adversely impacted by the lack
of trading liquidity for these securities, the lack of institutional research
coverage and concentrated selling by recipients of these securities.

The Trading Price of the New CNC Common Stock May be Adversely Affected by
Potential Dilution Caused by the New CNC Preferred Stock, the New CNC Warrants
and Management Options.

          In addition to the New CNC Common Stock, as of the Effective Date,
there will be issued and New CNC Preferred Stock (which will be exchangeable or
convertible into shares of New CNC Common Stock in the future), New CNC Warrants
to purchase 5% of the New CNC Common Stock and management options exercisable
for up to [__]% of the New CNC Common Stock. On and after 10 years from the
Effective Date, the New CNC Preferred Stock will be exchangeable into shares of
New CNC Common Stock based on the fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock
on the date of exchange. On and after September 30, 2005, the New CNC Preferred
Stock will be convertible into shares of New CNC Common Stock at a conversion
price, to be measured on the 120th day following the Effective Date, equal to
the average of the volume weighted average prices of the New CNC Common Stock
for the immediately preceding 60 days. The potential dilution of the New CNC
Common Stock from the conversion or exchange of the New CNC Preferred Stock, the
exercise of the New CNC Warrants and the exercise of the management options may
cause the market price of the New CNC Common Stock to trade significantly below
the level that it otherwise would.

Certain Holders of New CNC Common Stock May Hold Substantial Interests in
Reorganized CNC, Including Interests in Excess of 5%.

          During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, there is no limitation on
the trading of Claims. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Plan, certain
Holders of Claims may receive distributions of New CNC Common Stock representing
a substantial amount of the outstanding shares of New CNC Common Stock. If
Holders of significant numbers of shares of New CNC Common Stock were to act as
a group, such Holders could be in a position to control the outcome of actions
requiring stockholder approval, including, among other things, election of
directors. This concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a
negotiated change of control of the Company and, consequently, impact the value
of the New CNC Common Stock.

          Further, the possibility that one or more Holders of significant
numbers of shares of New CNC Common Stock may determine to sell all or a large
portion of their shares of New CNC Common Stock in a short period of time may
adversely affect the market price of the New CNC Common Stock.

Reorganized CNC's Certificate of Incorporation Imposes Restrictions on the
Voting Power of Significant Stockholders.

          In the event that any Person or group of affiliated Persons obtains
direct or indirect beneficial ownership of shares of capital stock of
Reorganized CNC providing such Person(s) in excess of 10% of the voting power
with respect to a particular stockholder vote, such Person(s) will be entitled
to vote only such number of shares of capital stock as do not in the aggregate
equal or exceed 10% of the voting power with

                                      -88-
<PAGE>

respect to that stockholder vote, unless, prior to that stockholder vote, the
acquisition, ownership and voting of such shares of capital stock by such
Person(s) in excess of 10% has been approved, or exempted from approval,
pursuant to all applicable insurance regulatory requirements. See Section II.G,
"Terms of New Securities and New Bank Debt to be Issued Pursuant to the Plan."

The New CNC Common Stock Will Be Issued in Odd Lots.

          Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests may receive odd
lot distributions (less than 100 shares) of New CNC Common Stock. Holders may
find it more difficult to dispose of odd lots in the marketplace and may face
increased brokerage charges in connection with any such disposition.

We Do Not Expect to Pay Cash Dividends on the New CNC Preferred Stock and New
CNC Common Stock For the Foreseeable Future.

          The terms of the New Credit Facility will limit, among other things,
Reorganized CNC's ability to pay dividends, and it is not anticipated that any
cash dividends will be paid on the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Common
Stock in the near future. See Section II.G., "Terms of New Securities and New
Bank Debt to be Issued Pursuant to the Plan."

Certain Tax Consequences of the Plan Raise Unsettled and Complex Legal Issues
and Involve Various Factual Determinations.

          Some of the material consequences of the Plan regarding United States
federal income taxes are summarized in Article IX hereof. Many of these tax
issues raise unsettled and complex legal issues, and also involve various
factual determinations, such as valuations, that raise additional uncertainties.
We cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a contrary view, and no ruling
from the IRS has been or will be sought regarding the tax consequences described
herein. In addition, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge the
various positions we have taken, or intend to take, with respect to our tax
treatment, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. FOR A MORE
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATING TO THE SPECIFIC POSITIONS WE INTEND TO
TAKE WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS TAX ISSUES, PLEASE REVIEW ARTICLE IX.

C.        RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our Degree of Leverage May Limit Our Financial and Operating Activities.

          We will have significant indebtedness even after the Plan is
consummated. Further, our historical capital requirements have been significant
and our future capital requirements could vary significantly and may be affected
by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance, and many other
factors that are not within our control. Recently, we have had difficulty
financing our operations due, in part, to our significant losses and leveraged
condition, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing in
the future. Even if the Plan is approved and consummated, we cannot assure you
that we will not experience losses. Our profitability and ability to generate
cash flow will likely depend upon our ability to successfully implement our
business strategy and meet or exceed the results forecasted in the projections.
However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish these results.

A Failure to Improve and Maintain the Financial Strength Ratings of Our
Insurance Subsidiaries Could Negatively Impact Our Operations and Financial
Results.

          An important competitive factor for our insurance subsidiaries is the
ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. See
"Description of Conseco's Business - The Company's Business - Competition". In
July 2002, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings of Conseco's
primary insurance subsidiaries to "B++ (Very Good)" and placed the ratings
"under review with negative implications." On August 14, 2002, A.M. Best further
lowered the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries
from "B++ (very good)" to "B (fair)". The A.M. Best downgrades caused sales of
our insurance products to decline and policyholder redemptions and lapses to
increase. In some cases, the downgrades also caused defections among our
independent agent sales force and increases in the

                                      -89-
<PAGE>

commissions we must pay. These events have had a material adverse effect on our
operations, financial results and liquidity.

          Although we currently expect our insurance subsidiaries to achieve a
category "A" rating by the end of 2004, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to achieve or maintain this rating. If we fail to achieve and maintain a
category "A" rating, sales of our insurance products could continue to fall and
additional existing policyholders may redeem or lapse their policies, adversely
affecting our future operations, financial results and liquidity.

The Covenants in the New Credit Facility Restrict Our Activities and Require Us
to Meet or Maintain Various Financial Ratios and Minimum Insurance Ratings.

          In connection with our reorganization, we will enter into the New
Credit Facility with our lenders. We have agreed to a number of covenants and
other provisions that restrict our ability to engage in various financing
transactions and pursue certain operating activities without the prior consent
of the lenders under the New Credit Facility. We have also agreed to meet or
maintain various financial ratios and minimum financial strength ratings for our
insurance subsidiaries. For instance, if we experience a ratings downgrade
following confirmation of the Plan, if we fail to achieve an "A-" rating by a
specified date following confirmation of the Plan or if we experience a ratings
downgrade after achieving an "A-" rating, we will suffer an event of default
under the New Credit Facility. Our ability to meet these financial and ratings
covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Although we expect to be
in compliance with these requirements as of the Effective Date, these
requirements represent significant restrictions on the manner in which we may
operate our business. If we default under any of these requirements, the lenders
could declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees to be due
and payable. If that were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance this indebtedness or any of our other
debts.

CNC and CIHC are Holding Companies and Depend on their Subsidiaries for Cash.

          CNC and CIHC are holding companies with no business operations of
their own; they depend on their operating subsidiaries for cash to make
principal and interest payments on debt, and to pay administrative expenses and
income taxes. The cash CNC and CIHC receive from insurance subsidiaries consists
of fees for services, tax sharing payments, dividends and distributions, and
from our non-insurance subsidiaries, loans and advances. A deterioration in the
financial condition, earnings or cash flow of the material subsidiaries of CNC
or CIHC for any reason could limit such subsidiaries' ability to pay cash
dividends or other disbursements to CNC and/or CIHC, which, in turn, would limit
CNC's and/or CIHC's ability to meet debt service requirements and satisfy other
financial obligations.

          The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject
to state insurance department regulations. These regulations generally permit
dividends to be paid from earned surplus of the insurance company for any
12-month period in amounts equal to the greater of (or in a few states, the
lesser of): (i) net gain from operations for the prior year; or (ii) 10% of
surplus as of the end of the preceding year. Any dividends in excess of these
levels require the approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable
state insurance department. As described in "Events Leading to The Chapter 11
Case - Insurance Ratings and Regulatory Issues," Bankers National Life Insurance
Company and Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas (on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries), entered into consent orders with the Commissioner of Insurance
for the State of Texas on October 30, 2002. These consent orders, among other
things, limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.

          Although we believe that amounts required for us to meet our financial
and operating obligations will be available from our subsidiaries and from funds
currently held by CNC and CIHC, our results for future periods are subject to
numerous uncertainties. We may encounter liquidity problems, which could affect
our ability to meet our obligations while attempting to meet competitive
pressures or adverse economic conditions.

                                      -90-
<PAGE>

The Obligations of CNC and CIHC are Structurally Subordinated to the Obligations
of CNC's and CIHC's Subsidiaries.

          Because our operations are conducted through subsidiaries, claims of
the creditors of those subsidiaries (including policyholders) will rank senior
to claims to distributions from the subsidiaries, which we depend on to make
payments on our obligations. CIHC's subsidiaries had indebtedness for borrowed
money (including capitalized lease obligations but excluding indebtedness to
affiliates), policy reserves and other liabilities of approximately $24.9
billion at September 30, 2002. The obligations of CNC and CIHC, as parent
holding companies, will rank effectively junior to these liabilities.

          If an insurance company subsidiary were to be liquidated, that
liquidation would be conducted under the insurance law of its state of domicile
by such state's insurance regulator as the receiver with respect to such
insurer's property and business. In the event of a default on our debt or our
insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization, our creditors and stockholders
will not have the right to proceed against the assets of our insurance
subsidiaries or to cause their liquidation under federal and state bankruptcy
laws.

Our Insurance Business Performance May Decline if Our Premium Rates Are Not
Adequate.

          We set the premium rates on our health insurance policies based on
facts and circumstances known at the time we issue the policies and on
assumptions about numerous variables, including the actuarial probability of a
policyholder incurring a claim, the severity, and the interest rate earned on
our investment of premiums. In setting premium rates, we consider historical
claims information, industry statistics, the rates of our competitors and other
factors. If our actual claims experience proves to be less favorable than we
assumed and we are unable to raise our premium rates, our financial results may
be adversely affected. We generally cannot raise our health insurance premiums
in any state unless we first obtain the approval of the insurance regulator in
that state. We review the adequacy of our premium rates regularly and file rate
increases on our products when we believe existing premium rates are too low. It
is possible that we will not be able to obtain approval for premium rate
increases from currently pending requests or requests filed in the future. If we
are unable to raise our premium rates because we fail to obtain approval for a
rate increase in one or more states, our net income may decrease. If we are
successful in obtaining regulatory approval to raise premium rates due to
unfavorable actual claims experience, the increased premium rates may reduce the
volume of our new sales and cause existing policyholders to allow their policies
to lapse. This would reduce our premium income in future periods. Increased
lapse rates also could require us to expense all or a portion of the deferred
policy costs relating to lapsed policies in the period in which those policies
lapse, adversely affecting our financial results in that period.

Our Reserves for Future Insurance Policy Benefits and Claims May Prove To Be
Inadequate, Requiring Us To Increase Liabilities and Resulting In Reduced Net
Income and Shareholders' Equity.

          We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of
claims to our policyholders based on assumptions made by our actuaries. For our
health insurance business, we establish an active life reserve plus a liability
for due and unpaid claims, claims in the course of settlement, and incurred but
not reported claims, as well as a reserve for the present value of amounts not
yet due on claims. Many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities, such
as economic and social conditions, inflation, hospital and pharmaceutical costs,
changes in doctrines of legal liability, and extracontractual damage awards.
Therefore, the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on
extensive estimates, assumptions and prior years' statistics. Establishing
reserves is an uncertain process, and it is possible that actual claims will
materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition. Our financial performance depends
significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is
consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our
policies. If our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect, and
our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses, we would
be required to increase our liabilities resulting in an adverse effect to our
financial results and financial position.

                                      -91-

Our Insurance Subsidiaries May be Required to Pay Assessments to Fund
Policyholder Losses or Liabilities; This May Have a Material Adverse Effect on
Our Results of Operations.

          The solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which an insurance
company does business may require that company to pay assessments (up to certain
prescribed limits) to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance
companies that become insolvent. Recent insolvencies of insurance companies
increase the possibility that these assessments may be required. These
assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would
threaten an insurer's financial strength and, in certain instances, may be
offset against future premium taxes. We cannot estimate the likelihood and
amount of future assessments. Any future assessments may have a material adverse
effect on our financial results and financial position.

We are Subject to Further Risk of Loss Notwithstanding Our Reinsurance
Arrangements.

          We transfer exposure to certain risks to others through reinsurance
arrangements. Under these arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our
losses and expenses associated with reported and unreported claims in exchange
for a portion of policy premiums. The availability, amount and cost of
reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly.
Furthermore, we face credit risk with respect to reinsurance. When we obtain
reinsurance, we are still liable for those transferred risks if the reinsurer
cannot meet its obligations. Therefore, the inability of our reinsurers to meet
their financial obligations could materially affect our operations and financial
condition.

We Are Subject to Extensive Regulation.

          Our insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and
supervision in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which is primarily for the
benefit and protection of our customers, and not for the benefit of our
investors or creditors. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state
insurance laws that establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative
powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
regulating sales and other practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms,
setting reserve and solvency requirements, determining the form and content of
required statutory financial statements, limiting dividends and prescribing the
type and amount of investments.

          We have been operating under heightened scrutiny from state insurance
regulators. As described in "Events Leading to The Chapter 11 Case - Insurance
Ratings and Regulatory Issues," our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Texas,
Bankers National Life Insurance Company and Conseco Life Insurance Company of
Texas (on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries), entered into consent orders
with the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Texas on October 30, 2002.

In Certain Circumstances, Regulatory Authorities May Place Our Insurance
Subsidiaries Under Regulatory Control.

          Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital
requirements. These requirements were designed to evaluate the adequacy of
statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks
associated with: asset quality; mortality and morbidity; asset and liability
matching; and other business factors. The requirements are used by states as an
early warning tool to discover potential weakly capitalized companies for the
purpose of initiating regulatory action. Generally, if an insurer's risk-based
capital falls below specified levels, the insurer would be subject to different
degrees of regulatory action depending upon the magnitude of the deficiency.
Possible regulatory actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions
to correct the risk-based capital deficiency to placing the insurer under
regulatory control.

Recently Enacted and Pending or Future Legislation Could Also Affect the
Financial Performance of Our Insurance Operations.

          During recent years, the health insurance industry has experienced
substantial changes, including those caused by healthcare legislation. Recent
federal and state legislation and legislative proposals relating to healthcare
reform contain features that could severely limit or eliminate our ability to
vary our

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

pricing terms or apply medical underwriting standards with respect to
individuals which could have the effect of increasing our loss ratios and have
an adverse effect on our financial results. In particular, Medicare reform and
legislation concerning prescription drugs could affect our ability to price or
sell our products.

          Proposals currently pending in Congress and some state legislatures
may also affect our financial results. These proposals include the
implementation of minimum consumer protection standards for inclusion in all
long term care policies, including: guaranteed premium rates; protection against
inflation; limitations on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions; setting
standards for sales practices for long term care insurance; and guaranteed
consumer access to information about insurers (including lapse and replacement
rates for policies and the percentage of claims denied). Enactment of any of
these proposals could adversely affect our financial results.

          In addition, the federal government may seek to regulate the insurance
industry, and recent government regulation may increase competition in the
insurance industry and may affect our insurance subsidiaries' current sales
methods. Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate
the insurance industry, federal initiatives often have a direct impact on the
insurance business. Current and proposed measures that may significantly affect
the insurance business generally include limitations on antitrust immunity and
minimum solvency requirements.

Changing Interest Rates May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

          Profitability may be directly affected by the level of and
fluctuations in interest rates. While we monitor the interest rate environment
and employ hedging strategies designed to mitigate the impact of changes in
interest rates, our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in
interest rates. Our spread-based insurance and annuity business is subject to
several inherent risks arising from movements in interest rates, especially if
we fail to anticipate or respond to such movements. First, interest rate changes
can cause compression of our net spread between interest earned on investments
and interest credited on customer deposits, thereby adversely affecting our
results. Second, if interest rate changes produce an unanticipated increase in
surrenders of our spread-based products, we may be forced to sell investment
assets at a loss in order to fund such surrenders. At September 30, 2002,
approximately 20 percent of our total insurance liabilities (or approximately
$4.5 billion) could be surrendered by the policyholder without penalty. Finally,
changes in interest rates can have significant effects on the performance of our
mortgage-backed securities portfolio, including collateralized mortgage
obligations, as a result of changes in the prepayment rate of the loans
underlying such securities. We follow asset/liability strategies that are
designed to mitigate the effect of interest rate changes on our profitability.
However, there can be no assurance that management will be successful in
implementing such strategies and achieving adequate investment spreads.

Litigation and Regulatory Investigations May Harm Our Financial Strength and
Reduce Our Profitability.

          Insurance companies historically have been subject to substantial
litigation resulting from claims disputes and other matters. In addition to the
traditional policy claims associated with their businesses, insurance companies
are increasingly facing policyholder suits, class actions and disputes with
reinsurers. The class actions and policyholder suits are often in connection
with insurance sales practices, policy and claims administration practices and
other market conduct issues. State insurance departments are increasingly
focusing on sales practices and product issues in their market conduct
examinations. Negotiated settlements of class action and other lawsuits have had
a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of
operations of insurance companies. As a result of these trends, we are in the
ordinary course of our business a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out
of our insurance business and investment operations, including class actions and
reinsurance disputes, and, from time to time, are also involved in various
governmental and administrative proceedings. Such litigation and proceedings may
harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. We cannot assure you
that such litigation will not adversely affect our future business, financial
condition or results of operations.

A Delay or an Unfavorable Outcome in the Dispute Surrounding Our Interest in the
GM Building May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Our Ability to Fund
Our Business Plan.

          As explained in Section VI.H.3 above, entities controlled by Donald J.
Trump currently dispute CNC's subsidiary's ability to acquire the GM Building
and later to monetize that asset. This dispute could delay Reorganized CNC's
subsidiary's ability to sell the GM Building and distribute the profits of that
sale. CNC's projections presume that CNC's interest in the GM Building will be
monetized in the first quarter of 2004, although timing of actual resolution of
the dispute with Trump and sale of the building is not certain. The Projections
attached hereto as Exhibit B presume that the GM Building will be sold for $1.1
billion. The mortgages on the GM Building, which total $700 million, are due on
August 1, 2003.

The Markets in Which We Compete Are Highly Competitive.

          Each of the markets in which we operate is highly competitive.
Competitors include other life insurers, commercial banks, thrifts, mutual funds
and broker-dealers. Many of our competitors in different segments and regions
are larger companies that have greater capital, technological and marketing
resources, and have access to capital at a lower cost. Because the actual cost
of products is unknown when they are sold, we are subject to competitors who may
sell a product at a price that does not cover its actual cost.

          Agents placing insurance business with our insurance subsidiaries
generally are compensated on a commission basis. There are many life and health
insurance companies in the U.S. Some of these companies may pay higher
commissions and charge lower premium rates, and many companies have more
substantial resources than we do. Publicity about our recent financial
difficulties may cause agents to place business with other insurers.

          We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our insurance
and annuity products. Strong competition exists among financial services
companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial
services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our
financial position, support services and compensation and product features. Our
competitiveness for such agents also depends upon the relationships we develop
with these agents. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales
representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues
would suffer.

Tax Law Changes Could Adversely Affect Our Insurance Product Sales and
Profitability.

          We sell deferred annuities and some forms of life insurance products
which are attractive to purchasers, in part, because policyholders generally are
not subject to United States federal income tax on increases in policy values
until some form of distribution is made. Recently, Congress enacted legislation
to lower marginal tax rates, reduce the federal estate tax gradually over a
ten-year period, with total elimination of the federal estate tax in 2010 and
increase contributions which may be made to individual retirement accounts and
401(k) accounts. While these tax law changes will sunset at the beginning of
2011 absent future congressional action, they could in the interim diminish the
appeal of our annuity and life insurance products. Additionally, Congress has
considered, from time to time, other possible changes to the U.S. tax laws,
including elimination of the tax deferral on the accretion of value within
certain annuities and life insurance products. There can be no assurance that
further tax legislation will not be enacted which would contain provisions with
possible adverse effects on our annuity and life insurance products.

The Impact of Recent Terrorist Attacks and Possible Military and Other Actions
May Adversely Affect the Insurance Industry and Financial Markets.

          Terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. on September
11, 2001 adversely affected commerce throughout the United States and resulted
in significant disruption to the insurance industry and significant declines and
volatility in financial markets. The continued threat of terrorism within the
United States and abroad, and the military action and heightened security
measures in response to that threat, including the possibility of hostilities in
Iraq, may cause additional disruptions to the insurance industry, reduced
economic activity and continued volatility in markets throughout the world,
which may adversely impact our financial results.

                                      IX.
                     CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

          The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Restructuring to the Debtors and Holders of Lender Claims,
Original Notes, Exchange Notes, Secured Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and
Old CNC Equity Interests. We sometimes refer to the Original Notes and the
Exchange Notes collectively as the "New Notes". This summary is based on the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations and practice, all as
in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, with
possible retroactive effect. Due to the lack of definitive judicial and
administrative authority in a number of areas, substantial uncertainty may exist
with respect to some of the tax consequences described below. No opinion of
counsel has been obtained, and the Debtors do not intend to seek a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") as to any of such tax consequences, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax
consequences of the Restructuring described below.

          This summary does not apply to Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes,
Secured Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity Interests that are
not United States persons (as defined in the Code) or that are otherwise subject
to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example,
banks (which includes some or all of the Holders of Lender Claims), governmental
authorities or agencies, financial institutions, insurance companies,
pass-through entities, tax-exempt organizations, brokers and dealers in
securities, mutual funds, small business investment companies, and regulated
investment companies). The following discussion assumes that Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity
Interests hold such interests as "capital assets" within the meaning of Code
Section 1221. Moreover, this summary does not purport to cover all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may apply to Debtors and Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity
Interests based upon their particular circumstances. Additionally, this summary
does not discuss any tax consequences that may arise under state, local, or
foreign tax law.

          The Debtors and the Official Unsecured Committee continue to explore
various possible alternative structures to maximize the going concern value of
the Reorganized Debtors' estates. In this regard, if the Debtors and the
Official Unsecured Committee determine that an alternative structure should be
implemented, the Plan may be modified to effectuate such alternate structure;
provided that such modifications shall not affect the treatment and recoveries
of Holders of Claims and Equity Interests set forth herein.

                                      -95-

          The following summary is not a substitute for careful tax planning and
advice based on the particular circumstances of each Holder of Lender Claims,
New Notes, Secured Notes, Trust Preferred Securities and Old CNC Equity
Interests. All Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the
U.S. federal income tax consequences, as well as any applicable state, local,
and foreign consequences of the Restructuring.

A.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
          AND EQUITY INTERESTS

          1.   Consequences to Holders of Lender Claims

          Pursuant to the Plan, the Lender Claims will be exchanged for the New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants. The U.S. federal income
tax consequences to Holders of the Lender Claims depend on whether (a) the
Reorganization will result in a deemed exchange of the Lender Claims for the New
Bank Debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (b) the Lender Claims are
treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code and (c) the Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization.

          Treasury regulations promulgated under Code Section 1001 (the
"Exchange Regulations") provide that if there is a "significant modification" in
the terms of a debt instrument, the modification is treated as a deemed exchange
of the debt instrument for a new debt instrument. The Exchange Regulations
provide that certain changes in the yield, timing of payments, changes in the
obligor or security and change in payment expectation result in a significant
modification of debt instruments. It is expected that the terms of the Lender
Claims will be modified and that the modifications would be treated as
significant under Code Section 1001.

          Whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is determined based on
all the facts and circumstances, but most authorities have held that the length
of the term of a debt instrument is an important factor in determining whether
such instrument is a security for federal income tax purposes. These authorities
have indicated that a term of less than five years is evidence that the
instrument is not a security, whereas a term of ten years or more is evidence
that it is a security. There are numerous other factors that could be taken into
account in determining whether a debt instrument is a security, including among
others, the security for payment, the creditworthiness of the obligor, the
subordination or lack thereof to other creditors, the right to vote or otherwise
participate in the management of the obligor, convertibility of the instrument
into an equity interest of the obligor, whether payments of interest are fixed,
variable or contingent, and whether such payments are made on a current basis or
accrued.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G). The
discussion of the tax consequences of the Restructuring to the Holders of Lender
Claims assumes that the Restructuring constitutes a tax-free reorganization.

          If the Lender Claims are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring is not treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of Lender
Claims will be treated as exchanging their Lender Claims for New Bank Debt, New
CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants in a taxable exchange under Section
1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of Lender Claims should recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of (a) the fair market value
of the New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants received and (b) the "issue
price" of the New Bank Debt received (provided such New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Warrants and/or New Bank Debt is not allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest) and (ii) such Holder's basis in the Lender Claims. To the extent such
Holders hold their Lender Claims as capital assets, such gain or loss should be
capital in nature and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the Lender
Claims were held for more than one year (subject to the "market discount" rules
discussed below). To the extent that a portion of the New Bank Debt, New CNC
Preferred Stock or New CNC Warrants received in exchange for the Lender Claims
is allocable to accrued but untaxed interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary
income. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New
CNC Preferred Stock (including in any fractional shares) and New CNC Warrants
received should equal the fair market value of the New CNC Preferred Stock and
New CNC Warrants as of the Effective Date and a

                                      -96-
<PAGE>

Holder's tax basis in New Bank Debt will equal its "issue price." The issue
price of the New Bank Debt should equal its stated principal amount since
neither the Lender Claims nor the New Bank Debt are (or will be) traded on an
established market and the New Bank Debt will provide for adequate stated
interest. A Holder's holding period for New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants should begin on the day following the Effective Date.

          If the Lender Claims are treated as securities and the Restructuring
pursuant to which the Lender Claims are exchanged for New Bank Debt, New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants is treated as a tax-free reorganization,
Holders of Lender Claims should not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange,
except that a Holder may recognize ordinary income to the extent that New Bank
Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants are treated as received in
satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on the Lender Claims. See "Accrued
But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants equal to the tax basis
of the Lender Claims surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for
the New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants that includes
the holding period for the Lender Claims; provided that the tax basis of New
Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants treated as received in
satisfaction of accrued interest should equal the amount of such accrued
interest, and the holding period for such New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock
and New CNC Warrants should not include the holding period of the Lender Claims.

          2.   Consequences to Holders of New Notes, Secured Notes and Trust
               Preferred Securities

               (a)  Exchange of New Notes for New CNC Common Stock

          Whether Holders of New Notes will recognize gain or loss on the
exchange of New Notes for New CNC Common Stock depends on whether (a) the
Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and (b) the New Notes are
treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).
Hence, the discussion of the tax consequences of the Restructuring to the
Holders of New Notes assumes that the Restructuring constitutes a tax-free
reorganization.

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. The following series of New
Notes have terms to maturity between five and ten years and, based on their
terms to maturity and other features, these series of New Notes are likely to be
treated as securities for federal income tax purposes: 6.4% Original Notes
(issued on February 15, 1998 and maturing on February 10, 2003); 8.75% Original
Notes (issued on February 3, 2000 and maturing on February 9, 2004); 6.8%
Original Notes (issued on June 5, 1998 and maturing on June 15, 2005); 9.0%
Original Notes (issued October 19, 1999 and maturing on October 15, 2006);
10.75% Original Notes (issued June 27, 2001 and maturing on June 15, 2008); 6.8%
Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on June 15, 2007); 9.0%
Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on October 15, 2008); and
10.75% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on June 15, 2009).

          The following series of New Notes have terms to maturity of less than
five years and, based on their terms to maturity and other features, these
series of New Notes may not be treated as securities for federal income tax
purposes: 8.5% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on October
15, 2003); 6.4% Exchange Notes (issued April 24, 2002 and maturing on February
10, 2004); 8.75% Exchange Notes (issued on April 24, 2002 and maturing on
February 9, 2006); and 8.5% Original Notes (issued on October 18, 1999 and
maturing on October 15, 2002).

          If any series of New Notes are treated as securities and the
Restructuring pursuant to which the New Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common
Stock is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such New Notes should
not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a Holder may
recognize ordinary income to the extent that New CNC Common Stock is treated as
received in satisfaction of

                                      -97-
<PAGE>

accrued but untaxed interest on such New Notes. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New CNC Common
Stock (including any fractional shares) equal to the tax basis of the New Notes
surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for the New CNC Common
Stock (including for any fractional share) that includes the holding period for
the New Notes; provided that the tax basis of any share of New CNC Common Stock
treated as received in satisfaction of accrued interest should equal the amount
of such accrued interest, and the holding period for such New CNC Common Stock
should not include the holding period of the New Notes.

          If any series of New Notes are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring pursuant to which the New Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common
Stock does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such New Notes
will be treated as exchanging their New Notes for New CNC Common Stock in a
taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of the
New Notes should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the
fair market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the New Notes and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis in the New
Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature so long as the New Notes
are held as capital assets (subject to the "market discount" rules described
below) and should be long-term capital gain or loss if the New Notes were held
for more than one year. To the extent that a portion of the New CNC Common Stock
received in exchange for the New Notes is allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New CNC Common Stock (including in any
fractional share) received should equal the fair market value of the New CNC
Common Stock as of the Effective Date. A Holder's holding period for New CNC
Common Stock (including for any fractional share) should begin on the day
following the Effective Date.

               (b) Exchange of Secured Notes for New CNC Common Stock or New
Secured Notes

          Pursuant to the Plan, the Holders of Secured Notes will receive either
(a) New CNC Common Stock or (b) New Secured Notes. Whether Holders of Secured
Notes will recognize gain or loss on the exchange of Secured Notes for New CNC
Common Stock or New Secured Notes depends on (a) the type of consideration
received (i.e., New CNC Common Stock or New Secured Notes); (b) whether the
Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and (c) whether Secured
Notes and (if the Holders of Secured Notes receive New Secured Notes) New
Secured Notes are treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization
provisions of the Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G).
Hence, the discussion of the tax consequences of the Restructuring to the
Holders of Secured Notes assumes that the Restructuring constitutes a tax-free
reorganization.

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. Each series of Secured Notes has
a term to maturity of approximately ten years and, based on their terms to
maturity and other features, the Secured Notes should be treated as securities
for federal income tax purposes. At this time, the maturity date and other terms
of the New Secured Notes have not yet been determined.

          If Holders of Secured Notes receive New CNC Common Stock under the
Plan, and (i) Secured Notes are treated as securities and (ii) the Restructuring
pursuant to which the Secured Notes are exchanged for New CNC Common Stock is
treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such Secured Notes should not
recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a Holder may recognize
ordinary income to the extent that New CNC Common Stock is treated as received
in satisfaction of accrued but untaxed interest on such Secured Notes. See
"Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in
the New CNC Common Stock (including any fractional shares) equal to the tax
basis of the Secured Notes surrendered therefor and should have a holding period
for the New CNC Common Stock (including for any fractional shares) that includes
the holding period for the Secured Notes; provided that the tax basis of any
share of New CNC Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of accrued
interest should

                                      -98-
<PAGE>

equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the holding period for such New
CNC Common Stock should not include the holding period of the Secured Notes.

          If Holders of Secured Notes receive New CNC Common Stock under the
Plan, and (i) the Secured Notes are not treated as securities or (ii) the
Restructuring pursuant to which the Secured Notes are exchanged for New CNC
Common Stock does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such
Secured Notes will be treated as exchanging their Secured Notes for New CNC
Common Stock in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly,
a Holder of the Secured Notes should recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between (i) the fair market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the
Effective Date) received in exchange for the Secured Notes and (ii) the Holder's
adjusted basis in the Secured Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in
nature so long as the Secured Notes are held as capital assets (subject to the
"market discount" rules described below) and should be long-term capital gain or
loss if the Secured Notes were held for more than one year. To the extent that a
portion of the New CNC Common Stock received in exchange for the Secured Notes
is allocable to accrued but untaxed interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary
income. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New
CNC Common Stock (including in any fractional shares) received should equal the
fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock as of the Effective Date. A
Holder's holding period for New CNC Common Stock (including for any fractional
share) should begin on the day following the Effective Date.

          If Holders of Secured Notes receive New Secured Notes under the Plan,
and (i) both, Secured Notes and New Secured Notes are treated as securities and
(ii) the Restructuring pursuant to which the Secured Notes are exchanged for New
Secured Notes is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of such Secured
Notes should not recognize any gain or loss on the exchange, except that a
Holder may recognize ordinary income to the extent that any portion of New
Secured Notes is treated as received in satisfaction of accrued but untaxed
interest on such Secured Notes. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. Such
Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New Secured Notes equal to the tax basis
of the Secured Notes surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for
the New Secured Notes that includes the holding period for the Secured Notes;
provided that the tax basis of any portion of New Secured Notes treated as
received in satisfaction of accrued interest should equal the amount of such
accrued interest, and the holding period for such New Secured Notes should not
include the holding period of the Secured Notes.

          If Holders of Secured Notes receive New Secured Notes under the Plan,
and (i) either the Secured Notes or New Secured Notes are not treated as
securities or (ii) the Restructuring pursuant to which the Secured Notes are
exchanged for New Secured Notes does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization,
Holders of such Secured Notes will be treated as exchanging their Secured Notes
for New Secured Notes in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code.
Accordingly, a Holder of the Secured Notes should recognize gain or loss equal
to the difference between (i) the value of New Secured Notes (as of the
Effective Date) received in exchange for the Secured Notes and (ii) the Holder's
adjusted basis in the Secured Notes. Such gain or loss should be capital in
nature so long as the Secured Notes are held as capital assets (subject to the
"market discount" rules described below) and should be long-term capital gain or
loss if the Secured Notes were held for more than one year. To the extent that a
portion of the New Secured Notes received in exchange for the Secured Notes is
allocable to accrued but untaxed interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary
income. See "Accrued But Untaxed Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New
Secured Notes received should equal the value of the New Secured Notes as of the
Effective Date. A Holder's holding period for New Secured Notes should begin on
the day following the Effective Date.

          (c)  Exchange of Trust Preferred Securities for New CNC Common Stock

          Whether Holders of Trust Preferred Securities will recognize gain or
loss on the exchange of Trust Preferred Securities for New CNC Common Stock
depends on whether (a) the Restructuring qualifies as a tax-free reorganization
and (b) the Subordinated Debentures underlying the Trust Preferred Securities
are treated as "securities" for purposes of the reorganization provisions of the
Code.

          As explained in more detail below (see "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences to CNC," "G Reorganization") the Restructuring should
constitute a tax-free reorganization as described in Code

                                      -99-
<PAGE>

ss.368(a)(1)(G). Hence, the discussion of the tax consequences of the
Restructuring to the Holders of Trust Preferred Securities assumes that the
Restructuring constitutes a tax-free reorganization.

          As described above, whether an instrument constitutes a "security" is
determined based on all the facts and circumstances, with the length of the term
of a debt instrument being an important factor. Each series of Trust Preferred
Securities (other than the 6.75% Trust Preferred Securities) has a term to
maturity of more than five years and, based on their term to maturity and other
features, the Subordinated Debentures underlying the Trust Preferred Securities
should be treated as securities for federal income tax purposes.

          If the Trust Preferred Securities are treated as securities and the
Restructuring pursuant to which the Trust Preferred Securities are exchanged for
New CNC Common Stock is treated as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of the
Trust Preferred Securities should not recognize any gain or loss on the
exchange, except that a Holder may recognize ordinary income to the extent that
New CNC Common Stock is treated as received in satisfaction of accrued but
untaxed interest on Trust Preferred Securities. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. Such Holder should obtain a tax basis in the New CNC Common
Stock (including any fractional shares) equal to the tax basis of Trust
Preferred Securities surrendered therefor and should have a holding period for
the New CNC Common Stock (including for any fractional share) that includes the
holding period for the Trust Preferred Securities; provided that the tax basis
of any share of New CNC Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of
accrued interest should equal the amount of such accrued interest, and the
holding period for such New CNC Common Stock should not include the holding
period of the Trust Preferred Securities.

          If the Trust Preferred Securities are not treated as securities or the
Restructuring pursuant to which the Trust Preferred Securities are exchanged for
New CNC Common Stock does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, Holders of
such Trust Preferred Securities will be treated as exchanging their Trust
Preferred Securities for New CNC Common Stock in a taxable exchange under
Section 1001 of the Code. Accordingly, a Holder of Trust Preferred Securities
should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the fair
market value of New CNC Common Stock (as of the Effective Date) received in
exchange for the Trust Preferred Securities and (ii) the Holder's adjusted basis
in the Trust Preferred Securities. Such gain or loss should be capital in nature
(subject to the "market discount" rules described below) and should be long-term
capital gain or loss if the Trust Preferred Securities were held for more than
one year. To the extent that a portion of the New CNC Common Stock received in
exchange for the Trust Preferred Securities is allocable to accrued but untaxed
interest, the Holder may recognize ordinary income. See "Accrued But Untaxed
Interest" below. A Holder's tax basis in New CNC Common Stock (including in any
fractional share) received should equal the fair market value of the New CNC
Common Stock as of the Effective Date. A Holder's holding period for New CNC
Common Stock (including for any fractional share) should begin on the day
following the Effective Date.

               (d) Accrued Interest and Market Discount

               (i) Accrued But Untaxed Interest

          To the extent that any amount received in the Reorganization by a
Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities
is attributable to accrued but untaxed interest, such amount should be taxable
to the Holder as interest income, if such accrued interest has not been
previously included in the Holder's gross income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Conversely, a Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes or
Trust Preferred Securities may be able to recognize a deductible loss (or,
possibly, a write-off against a reserve for bad debts) to the extent that any
accrued interest was previously included in the Holder's gross income but was
not paid in full by CNC.

          The extent to which New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock,
Secured Notes or New CNC Warrants received by a Holder of Lender Claims, New
Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities will be attributable to
accrued but untaxed interest is unclear. Under the Plan, the aggregate
consideration to be distributed to Holders of Allowed Claims in each Class will
be treated as first satisfying an amount equal to the stated principal amount of
the Allowed Claim for such Holders and any remaining consideration as satisfying
accrued, but unpaid, interest, if any. Certain legislative history indicates
that an

                                     -100-
<PAGE>

allocation of consideration as between principal and interest provided in a
bankruptcy plan is binding for federal income tax purposes. However, the IRS
could take the position that the consideration received by a Holder should be
allocated in some way other than as provided in the Plan. Holders of Lender
Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes and Trust Preferred Securities should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the proper allocation of the consideration
received by them under the Plan.

               (ii) Market Discount

          Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes and Trust Preferred
Securities who exchange Lender Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes or Trust
Preferred Securities for New Bank Debt, New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Common
Stock, New Secured Notes or New CNC Warrants may be affected by the "market
discount" provisions of Code Sections 1276 through 1278. Under these rules, some
or all of the gain realized by a Holder of Lender Claims, New Notes or Trust
Preferred Securities may be treated as ordinary income (instead of capital
gain), to the extent of the amount of "market discount" on such Lender Claims,
New Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities.

          In general, a debt obligation with a fixed maturity of more than one
year that is acquired by a holder on the secondary market (or, in certain
circumstances, upon original issuance) is considered to be a acquired with
"market discount " as to that holder if the debt obligation's stated redemption
price at maturity (or revised issue price, in the case of a debt obligation
issued with original issue discount) exceeds the tax basis of the debt
obligation in the holder's hands immediately after its acquisition. However, a
debt obligation will not be a "market discount bond" if such excess is less than
a statutory de minimis amount (equal to 0.25 percent of the sum of all remaining
payments to be made on the debt instrument, excluding qualified stated interest,
multiplied by the number of remaining whole years to maturity).

          Any gain recognized by a Holder on the taxable disposition of Lender
Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities (determined as
described above) that were acquired with market discount should be treated as
ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that accrued thereon while
the Lender Claims, New Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities were
considered to be held by a Holder (unless the Holder elected to include market
discount in income as it accrued). To the extent that the Lender Claims, New
Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities that were acquired with
market discount are exchanged in a tax-free transaction for other property (as
may occur here), any market discount that accrued on the Lender Claims, New
Notes, Secured Notes or Trust Preferred Securities (i.e., up to the time of the
exchange) but was not recognized by the Holder is carried over to the property
received therefor and any gain recognized on the subsequent sale, exchange,
redemption or other disposition of such property is treated as ordinary income
to the extent of such accrued market discount.

               (e) Receipt of Interests in a Residual Trust

          On the Effective Date, the Residual Trust shall be settled and exist
as a grantor trust for the benefit of certain creditors. Subject to definitive
guidance from the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction to the contrary
(including the receipt of an adverse determination by the IRS upon audit if not
contested by the Residual Trustee), pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.671-1(a) and/or Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d) and related
regulations, the Residual Trustee may designate and file returns for the
Residual Trust as a "grantor trust" and/or "liquidating trust" and therefore,
for federal income tax purposes, the Residual Trust's taxable income (or loss)
should be allocated pro rata to its beneficiaries.

          The tax consequences of the right to receive and of the receipt (if
any) of property from the Residual Trust are uncertain, and may depend, among
other things, on the timing of the distribution and the nature of the property
received. It is possible that the receipt of property from the Residual Trust
would be a taxable event to the Holders of Claims at the time the property is
received; however, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to treat the
right to receive property from the Residual Trust as property received at the
time of the Restructuring, and tax it in the same manner as cash or other
property received on the exchange. Alternatively, the Holders of Claims could be
treated as exchanging the right to receive property from the Residual Trust in
exchange for a portion of Claims. Finally, a portion of any amount of property
received from the Residual Trust may be treated in respect of accrued but unpaid
interest to the Holders of

                                     -101-
<PAGE>

Claims. In light of these substantial uncertainties, Holders of Claims are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the right to
receive and of the receipt (if any) of property from the Residual Trust.

          3.   Consequences to Holders of Old CNC Preferred Stock and Old CNC
               Common Stock

          Holders of Old CNC Preferred Stock and Old CNC Common Stock that is
cancelled in the Restructuring will be allowed a worthless stock deduction
(unless such Holder had previously claimed a worthless stock deduction with
respect to any Old CNC Preferred Stock or Old CNC Common Stock and assuming that
the taxable year that includes the Restructuring is the same taxable year in
which such stock first became worthless) in an amount equal to the Holder's
adjusted basis in the Old CNC Preferred Stock and/or Old CNC Common Stock. A
worthless stock deduction is a deduction allowed to a holder of a corporation's
stock for the taxable year in which such stock becomes worthless. If the Holder
held Old CNC Preferred Stock and/or Old CNC Common Stock as a capital asset, the
loss will be treated as a loss from the sale or exchange of such capital asset.

          4.   Consequences to Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
               Claims

          Pursuant to the Plan, Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured
Claims may receive a distribution of New CNC Common Stock in respect of such
claims. Holders of Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims should recognize
gain or loss equal to the amount realized under the Plan in respect of their
claims less their respective tax basis in those claims. The amount realized for
this purpose generally will equal the fair market value of New CNC Common stock
and other consideration (if any) received under the Plan. Any gain or loss
recognized in the exchange will be capital or ordinary depending on the status
of the claim in the Holder's hands. The Holder's aggregate tax basis for any
consideration received under the Plan should equal the fair market value of the
property received under the Plan. The holding period for any consideration under
the Plan generally will begin on the day following the Effective Date.

B.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO CNC

          1.   G Reorganization

          CNC intends to accomplish the Restructuring in the form of a
reorganization described in Code ss.368(a)(1)(G) (a "G Reorganization").
Pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, CNC will transfer substantially all
of its assets (principally the stock of CIHC and other direct subsidiaries of
CNC) to Reorganized CNC in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Warrants, New Secured Notes and Reorganized CNC's assumption of
certain indebtedness of CNC, as specified in the Plan. Certain of CNC's assets
(the "unwanted assets") will not be transferred to Reorganized CNC. The unwanted
assets consist of (i) the stock of certain indirect subsidiaries of CNC that
management of CNC has determined do not have material operations that would be
beneficial to Reorganized CNC and its subsidiaries and (ii) cash or cash
equivalents that will be used to satisfy certain obligations of CNC pursuant to
the Plan. CNC will then distribute New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred
Stock, New Secured Notes and New CNC Warrants to Holders of Lender Claims, New
Notes and Trust Preferred Securities.

          This transfer of assets and distribution of New CNC Common Stock, New
CNC Preferred Stock, New Secured Notes and New CNC Warrants pursuant to the Plan
should constitute a reorganization as described in Code ss. 368(a)(1)(G),
assuming that certain non-statutory requirements, such as the requirement that a
reorganization have a business purpose and preserve continuity of proprietary
interest, are satisfied. The (i) corporate law benefits to be derived from an
incorporation of Reorganized CNC in Delaware, (ii) ability of CNC to leave
unwanted assets behind in the Reorganization in order to facilitate the winding
up of certain non-critical subsidiaries and the satisfaction of certain claims
pursuant to the Plan, and (iii) ability of CNC to substantially reduce its debt
in the Reorganization should satisfy the business purpose requirement. For
purposes of G reorganizations, a corporation's creditors that receive stock are
considered to hold proprietary interests; as a result, the receipt of New CNC
Common Stock and

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

New CNC Preferred Stock by the holders of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust
Preferred Securities should satisfy the requirements for continuity of
proprietary interest. Accordingly, the transfer of assets by CNC to Reorganized
CNC in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC
Warrants and the distribution of all consideration received from Reorganized CNC
to the creditors of CNC should constitute a G Reorganization.

          Assuming that the transfers and distributions described above
constitute a G reorganization, (i) CNC will recognize no gain or loss with
respect to such transactions, (ii) CNC's taxable year will close on the
Effective Date and it will begin a new taxable year on the day after the
Effective Date, and (iii) all of CNC's tax attributes existing on the Effective
Date, including NOLs and other loss and credit carryovers, will be transferred
to Reorganized CNC as of the close of the Effective Date. Thus any income
recognized by CNC (and not excluded under Code ss. 108) in its tax year
beginning on the day following the Effective Date (or subsequent tax years),
during its winding up, will not be protected by CNC's pre-Effective Date NOLs,
but only by NOLs (if any) incurred after the Effective Date or attributable to
unwanted assets.

          If the transfers and distributions described above do not constitute a
G reorganization, (i) CNC will recognize gain or loss with respect to the
transaction, although the amount of such gain, if any, is not expected to exceed
the amount of the NOL of CNC, and thus is not expected to result in any tax upon
CNC, (ii) CNC's taxable year will not close on the Effective Date, and (iii) all
of CNC's tax attributes should remain with CNC, and will not be transferred to
Reorganized CNC.

          2.   Cancellation of Indebtedness and Reduction of Tax Attributes

          As a result of the Restructuring, the amount of CNC's aggregate
outstanding indebtedness will be substantially reduced. In general, absent an
exception, a debtor will realize and recognize cancellation of indebtedness
income ("COD Income") upon satisfaction of its outstanding indebtedness for
total consideration less than the amount of such indebtedness. The amount of COD
Income, in general, is the excess of (a) the adjusted issue price of the
indebtedness satisfied, over (b) the sum of the issue price of any new
indebtedness of the taxpayer issued, the amount of cash paid and the fair market
value of any new consideration (including stock of the debtor) given in
satisfaction of such indebtedness at the time of the exchange.

         A debtor will not, however, be required to include any amount of COD
Income in gross income if the debtor is under the jurisdiction of a court in a
Title 11 bankruptcy proceeding and the discharge of debt occurs pursuant to that
proceeding. Instead, as a consequence of such exclusion, a debtor must reduce
its tax attributes by the amount of COD Income which it excluded from gross
income under Code Section 108. In general, tax attributes will be reduced in the
following order: (a) net operating losses ("NOLs"), (b) tax credits and capital
loss carryovers, and (c) tax basis in assets.

          Because the Plan provides that Holders of New Notes, Lender Claims and
Trust Preferred Securities will receive New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred
Stock, New CNC Warrants and New Bank Debt, the amount of COD Income, and
accordingly the amount of tax attributes required to be reduced, will depend on
the fair market value of the New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock, New
CNC Warrants and the issue price of New Bank Debt. These values and issue price
of the New Bank Debt cannot be known with certainty until after the Effective
Date. Thus, although it is expected that a reduction of tax attributes will be
required, the exact amount of such reduction cannot be predicted.

C.        CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO REORGANIZED CNC

          1.   Transfer of Assets from CNC to Reorganized CNC

          Reorganized CNC will recognize no gain or loss with respect to the
receipt of CNC assets in exchange for New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred
Stock and New CNC Warrants pursuant to the Restructuring. Assuming, as described
above, that the transfer of assets by CNC to Reorganized CNC constitutes a G
reorganization, the assets transferred to Reorganized CNC will have the same
basis in Reorganized CNC's hands as such assets did in CNC's hands, and
Reorganized CNC's holding period for such assets will include CNC's holding
period. Reorganized CNC will also succeed to CNC's tax attributes

                                     -103-
<PAGE>

at the close of the Effective Date. As described above, subject to potential
limitations imposed by Code Section 382, as described below, Reorganized CNC
intends to take the position that CNC will succeed to the attributes of
Reorganized CNC without reduction for the COD Income of CNC, and that such
attributes will be available to offset income of Reorganized CNC in its tax year
beginning on the day following the Effective Date (and in subsequent tax years).
However, there is no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position
and assert that Reorganized CNC will only succeed to the attributes of CNC with
a reduction for the COD Income of CNC, or, as discussed below, that Code Section
269 will apply to reduce or eliminate Reorganized CNC's ability to use the
attributes of CNC.

          2.   Limitation of Net Operating Loss Carryovers and Other Tax
               Attributes

          Code Section 382 generally limits a corporation's use of its NOLs (and
may limit a corporation's use of certain built-in losses if such built-in losses
are recognized within a five-year period following an ownership change) if a
corporation undergoes an "ownership change." This discussion describes the
limitation determined under Code Section 382 in the case of an "ownership
change" as the "Section 382 Limitation." The Section 382 Limitation on the use
of pre-change losses (the NOLs and built-in losses recognized within the five
year post-ownership change period) in any "post change year" is generally equal
to the product of the fair market value of the loss corporation's outstanding
stock immediately before the ownership change and the long term tax-exempt rate
(which is published monthly by the Treasury Department and most recently was
approximately 4.65%) in effect for the month in which the ownership change
occurs. In addition, Code Section 383 applies a similar limitation to capital
loss carryforwards and tax credits.

          In general, an ownership change occurs when the percentage of the
corporation's stock owned by certain "5 percent shareholders" increases by more
than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned at any time during
the applicable "testing period" (generally, the shorter of (a) the three-year
period preceding the testing date or (b) the period of time since the most
recent ownership change of the corporation). A "5 percent shareholder" for these
purposes includes, generally, an individual or entity that directly or
indirectly owns 5 percent or more of a corporation's stock during the relevant
period, and may include one or more groups of shareholders that in the aggregate
own less than 5 percent of the value of the corporation's stock. Under
applicable Treasury Regulations, an ownership change with respect to an
affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return that have
consolidated NOLs is generally measured by changes in stock ownership of the
parent corporation of the group. An ownership change will occur with respect to
CNC and its successor, Reorganized CNC, in connection with the Plan. Therefore,
Reorganized CNC's ability to use its NOLs will be limited by Code ss. 382.

          When an "ownership change" occurs pursuant to the implementation of a
plan of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code, the general Section 382
Limitation may not apply if certain requirements are satisfied. Under Section
382(l)(5) of the Code, the Section 382 Limitation does not apply to an ownership
change of a loss corporation if the corporation was under the jurisdiction of a
bankruptcy court immediately before the change and those persons who were
shareholders and creditors of the loss corporation immediately before the
ownership change own at least 50 percent of the loss corporation's stock by
value and voting power after the ownership change (the "Bankruptcy Exception").

          Thus, under Code Section 382(l)(5), Reorganized CNC would avoid
entirely the application of Section 382 Limitation to the NOLs and recognized
built-in losses, if any, but would be required to reduce their NOLs and possibly
other tax attributes by any deduction for interest claimed by CNC with respect
to any indebtedness converted into stock for (a) the three-year period preceding
the taxable year of the "ownership change" and (b) the portion of the year of
the "ownership change" prior to the consummation of the Plan. However,
Reorganized CNC currently intends to elect out of the application of Code
Section 382(l)(5). Instead, CNC expects to take advantage of the special rule in
Code Section 382(l)(6) (discussed immediately below).

          As noted above, the Section 382 Limitation is generally determined by
reference to the fair market value of the loss corporation's outstanding stock
immediately before the ownership change. However, Code Section 382(l)(6)
provides that a debtor may elect, in the case of an ownership change resulting
from a bankruptcy proceeding of a debtor, to have the value of the debtor's
stock for the purpose of calculating the

                                     -104-
<PAGE>

Section 382 Limitation determined by reference to the net equity value of the
debtor's stock immediately after the ownership change. Although it is not
possible to know with certainty what the fair market value of New CNC Common
Stock and New CNC Preferred Stock will be following the Effective Date (and
accordingly what the amount of the Section 382 Limitation would be), CNC
believes that the Code Section 382(l)(6) rule could be of significant benefit
with respect to Reorganized CNC's ability to utilize any remaining tax
attributes following the Effective Date. Accordingly, CNC currently intends to
elect the application of this rule. Thus, for purposes of calculating the
Section 382 Limitation, the value of New CNC Common Stock and New CNC Preferred
Stock would reflect the increase, if any, in value resulting from any surrender
or cancellation of creditors' claims against CNC in the bankruptcy.

          3.   Application of Code Section 269 to the G Reorganization

          Pursuant to Code Section 269(a)(1), the IRS may disallow a corporate
tax benefit if the principal purpose for an acquisition of 50% or more (in vote
or value) of the stock of a corporation (the "Applicable Stock Acquisition") is
the evasion or avoidance of federal income tax by securing a corporate tax
benefit that would not otherwise be available. Furthermore, pursuant to Code
Section 269(a)(2), the IRS may disallow a corporate tax benefit if the principal
purpose for certain asset acquisitions (the "Applicable Asset Acquisition") is
the evasion or avoidance of federal income tax by securing a corporate tax
benefit that would not otherwise be available. If the IRS were to assert Code
Section 269 with respect to an Applicable Stock Acquisition or an Applicable
Asset Acquisition, the taxpayer would have the burden of proof because the IRS's
determination of a tax avoidance principal purpose is presumptively correct. If
the taxpayer is unable to carry the burden of proving a principal purpose other
than tax avoidance, the determination of a tax avoidance would stand.

          In the Reorganization, Reorganized CNC will acquire substantially all
of the assets of CNC and more than 50% in value of New CNC Common Stock will be
acquired by Holders of New Notes and Trust Preferred Securities. If the IRS
determines that either the acquisition of New CNC Common Stock or CNC assets is
principally for tax avoidance purposes, it could assert that Code Section 269
authorizes it to disallow deductions with respect to some or all of Reorganized
CNC's NOLs. This determination is primarily a question of fact.

          There is a risk that the IRS could assert that the principal purpose
of the G Reorganization is to enhance the ability of the reorganized CNC to
utilize its NOLs. To prevail in this assertion, the IRS must demonstrate that
the purpose to evade or avoid federal income tax exceeds in importance any other
purpose. The determination of the purpose for which an acquisition was made
requires a scrutiny of the entire circumstances in which the transaction or
course of conduct occurred, in connection with the tax result claimed to arise
therefrom. Courts are generally reluctant to invoke Code Section 269 where a
reasonable business purpose existed for the timing and form of the acquisition,
even if the availability of NOLs was also a major consideration in the
transaction.

          As noted above, the determination of whether tax avoidance is the
principal motivation of a transaction is primarily a question of fact. Although
the matter is subject to some uncertainty, CNC believes that, if the G
Reorganization were challenged by the IRS, the IRS should not be able to
demonstrate that the federal tax avoidance was the principal motivation for the
G Reorganization. CNC believes that the acquisition of control of CNC and
Reorganized CNC by holders of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust Preferred
Securities pursuant to the Plan will be made for legitimate business purposes.
The Holders of Lender Claims, New Notes and Trust Preferred Securities will be
offered New CNC Common Stock, New CNC Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants
because CNC cannot offer them sufficient cash and/or new debt instruments to
preserve their investment in CNC. In light of business exigencies requiring CNC
to satisfy most of the claims against CNC with New CNC Common Stock, New CNC
Preferred Stock and New CNC Warrants, tax avoidance should not be considered the
principal motivation for the Plan. Further, CNC believes that there are
legitimate business purposes for the reincorporation of CNC, an Indiana
corporation, as Reorganized CNC, a Delaware corporation, which will carry on the
CNC business unhampered by concerns relating to the unwanted assets.
Accordingly, CNC believes that Code Section 269 should not apply to the G
Reorganization.

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

          If, nevertheless, the IRS were to make an assertion that Code Section
269 applied and such assertion were sustained, Code Section 269 would severely
limit or even extinguish Reorganized CNC's ability to utilize CNC's
pre-ownership change NOLs to which it succeeded in the G Reorganization. Due to
the highly fact dependent nature of this issue, there can be no assurance that
the IRS would not prevail if it were to assert the application of Code Section
269 to the G Reorganization.

          4.   Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

          Under the backup withholding rules, a Holder of a Claim may be subject
to backup withholding with respect to distributions or payments made pursuant to
the Plan unless that holder (a) comes within certain exempt categories (which
generally include corporations) and, when required, demonstrates that fact or
(b) provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies under
penalty of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct and that
the holder is not subject to backup withholding because of a failure to report
all dividend and interest income. Backup withholding is not an additional tax,
but merely an advance payment that may be refunded to the extent it results in
an overpayment of tax.

          CNC and Reorganized CNC will withhold all amounts required by law to
be withheld from payments of interest and dividends. CNC and Reorganized CNC
will comply with all applicable reporting requirements of the Code.

THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN ARE COMPLEX. THE FOREGOING
SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT MAY BE
RELEVANT TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND
INCOME TAX SITUATION. ALL HOLDERS OF LENDER CLAIMS, NEW NOTES, SECURED NOTES,
TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND EQUITY INTERESTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX
ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED BY THE RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY
STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, AND OF ANY CHANGE IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.

                                 RECOMMENDATION

          In the opinion of the Debtors, the Plan is preferable to the
alternatives described herein because it provides for a larger distribution to
the Holders than would otherwise result in a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code. In addition, any alternative other than confirmation of the
Plan could result in extensive delays and increased administrative expenses
resulting in smaller distributions to the Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests. Accordingly, the Debtors recommend that Holders of Claims and Equity
Interests entitled to vote on the Plan support confirmation of the Plan and vote
to accept the Plan.
