underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the underwriters selected

offering by the Company; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the Holder shall not be
required to make any representations, warranties or indemnities except as they

underwriting agreement and to the Holder&#146;s intended method of distribution, and
the liability of the Holder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net
proceeds from the offering received by the Holder. If the total number of
securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by shareholders to be
included in such offering (or in any other offering in which the Holder shall
have the right to include Registrable Securities pursuant to Section&nbsp;3) exceeds
the largest number of securities that the underwriters reasonably believe can
be sold without having an adverse effect on such offering, then the Company
shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such
securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters believe
will not have an adverse effect on such offering, and the number of shares that
may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated as follows: (i)&nbsp;first,
to the Holder and (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, to the extent additional securities may be
included in such offering, to other selling shareholders, pro rata according to
the total number of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each
such other selling shareholder or in such other proportions as shall mutually
be agreed to by such other selling shareholders.

indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding; <u>provided</u> <u>further</u>, <u>however</u>, that the indemnifying party shall not be
responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
indemnified parties. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying
party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not
relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under
this Section&nbsp;9 except if, and only to the extent that, the indemnifying party
is materially prejudiced thereby; and such failure to deliver written notice to
the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section&nbsp;9. An indemnifying
party may settle any action or claim under this Section&nbsp;9 at any time without
the consent of the indemnified party so long as such settlement involves no
cost or liability to the indemnified party and includes an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from all liability with respect to such claim
