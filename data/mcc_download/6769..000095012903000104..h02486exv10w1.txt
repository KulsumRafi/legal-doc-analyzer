      and Purchase Agreement and/or the Stamp Duty Agreement (the "GUARANTEED

      all the same limitations on liability to which the Purchaser is entitled
      under or in respect of the Sale and Purchase Agreement or the Stamp Duty
      Agreement, as the case may be).

3.    MATTERS NOT TO REDUCE THE PURCHASER'S GUARANTOR'S LIABILITY

3.1   If any purported obligation or liability of the Purchaser under the Sale
      and Purchase Agreement or the Stamp Duty Agreement which, if valid, would
      have been the subject of this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity is not or
      ceases to be valid or enforceable on any ground by reason of any defect in
      or want of powers of the Purchaser or irregular exercise thereof or lack
      of authority by any person apparently authorised to act on behalf of the
      Purchaser or any legal incapacity or any change in the constitution of or
      any amalgamation, reconstruction or liquidation of the Purchaser, the
      Purchaser's Guarantor shall nevertheless be liable in respect of that
      purported obligation or liability as if the same were fully valid and
      enforceable and as if the Purchaser's Guarantor were the principal debtor
      in respect thereof. The Purchaser's Guarantor hereby agrees to keep the
      Seller fully indemnified in accordance with the terms of this Deed of
      Guarantee and Indemnity against all Losses and Expenses arising from any
      failure of the Purchaser to carry out any such purported obligation or
      liability by reason of it not being or ceasing to be valid or enforceable
      as aforesaid.

3.2   The Purchaser's Guarantor undertakes that if any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations are not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee for any
      reason, it will (as a separate and independent stipulation) pay the Seller
      on demand whatever amount or amounts shall equal what it would have been
      liable to pay but for such irrecoverability.

3.3   The Guaranteed Obligations shall be discharged by the full performance by
      the Purchaser of its obligations under the Sale and Purchase Agreement and
      the Stamp Duty Agreement, but otherwise shall not be discharged or
      affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this
      provision, might operate to release or otherwise exonerate the Purchaser's
      Guarantor from those obligations in whole or in part including:


                                                                               6

            respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations);

      3.3.2 the taking, variation, compromise, renewal or release of or refusal
            or neglect to perform or enforce any rights, remedies or securities
            against the Purchaser;

      3.3.3 any modification, variation or addition to the terms
            of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any other
            document or security;

      3.3.4 any irregularity, defect or informality in the terms of any of the
            Guaranteed Obligations or any other document or security or any
            legal limitation, disability, incapacity or want of authority of any
            person other than the Seller or its Affiliates;

      3.3.5 any corporate reorganisation, reconstruction, amalgamation,
            dissolution, liquidation, merger, acquisition of or by or other
            alteration in the corporate existence or structure of the Seller or
            the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Guarantor;

      3.3.6 any composition or similar arrangement by the Seller or the
            Purchaser or the Purchaser's Guarantor or any other person; or

      3.3.7 any other act or thing whatsoever done or omitted or neglected to be
            done by the Seller in relation to the Guaranteed Obligations.

4.    NO COMPETITION

      Until all the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid, discharged or
      satisfied in full, the Purchaser's Guarantor waives all rights of
      subrogation and indemnity against the Purchaser in respect of Guaranteed
      Obligations and agrees not to share in any security held or monies
      received by the Seller on account of such liabilities or to claim or prove
      in competition with the Seller in the liquidation of the Purchaser (or its
      equivalent in any relevant jurisdiction) in respect of any monies paid by
      the Purchaser's Guarantor to the Seller under this Deed of Guarantee and
      Indemnity.

5.    DISCHARGE

      Where any discharge (whether in respect of any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise)
      is made in whole or in part or any


                                                                               7
<PAGE>
      arrangement is made on the faith of any payment, security or other
      disposition which is avoided or must be restored for any reason, the
      liability of the Purchaser's Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee and
      Indemnity shall continue as if the discharge or arrangement had not been
      made.

                  apply then that calculation of Annual C shall cease and this
                  Clause 9 shall not apply (save for Clause 9.3.3(D) and the
                  provisions of Clauses 9.5 and 9.12, to the extent relevant)
                  unless and until a further Calculation Event shall occur.

            (B)   The Purchaser's Guarantor, acting reasonably, shall give the
                  Seller its calculation of Annual C by no later than 1 month
                  after the Calculation Event together with reasonable
                  supporting calculations and documentation. The Seller shall
                  give notice to the Purchaser's Guarantor within 1 month of
                  receipt of that calculation stating whether it approves or
                  disapproves the calculation of Annual C, and in the event that
                  it fails to give such a notice within such period, it shall be
                  deemed to have approved such calculation of Annual C.

      9.3.2 Annual C shall thereafter be calculated for each subsequent calendar
            year, (provided that if the event that caused the Calculation Event
            ceases to apply then that calculation of Annual C shall cease and
            this Clause 9 shall not apply (save for Clause 9.3.3(D) and the
            provisions of Clauses 9.5 and 9.12, to the extent relevant) unless
            and until a further Calculation Event shall occur) by the
            Purchaser's Guarantor, acting reasonably, and will be provided to
            the Seller, together with reasonable supporting calculations and
            documentation, no later than 6 months before the expiry


                                                                              10

            date of the current Letter of Credit. The Seller shall give notice
            to the Purchaser's Guarantor within 1 month of receipt of that
            calculation stating whether it approves or disapproves the
            calculation of the Annual C, and in the event that it fails to give
            such a notice within such period, it shall be deemed to have
            approved such calculation of Annual C.

      9.3.3 (A)   If the Seller disapproves the calculation of the Annual C,
                  then, by no later than 10 days after receipt by the
                  Purchaser's Guarantor of the Seller's notice of disapproval,
                  an independent expert shall be appointed to determine the
                  value of Annual C. The independent expert shall be selected by
                  the mutual agreement of the Parties and in the absence of
                  agreement shall be appointed on the application of either
                  Party by the President for the time being of the Institute of
                  Petroleum in England (or any successor body thereto).

            (B)   The independent expert shall be a firm of engineers skilled by
                  reason of its qualification, experience and expertise in the
                  estimation of abandonment costs for offshore oil and gas
                  facilities.

            (C)   The independent expert shall act as an expert and not as an
                  arbitrator, it shall be appointed on the basis that it keeps
                  strictly confidential to the Parties all information provided
                  to it by the Parties hereunder and its decision shall, in the
                  absence of manifest error, be final and binding on the
                  Parties.

            (D)   The costs of the independent expert shall be borne as to fifty
                  per cent (50%) by the Seller and fifty per cent (50%) by the
                  Purchaser's Guarantor.

            (E)   The Purchaser's Guarantor shall use its best endeavours to
                  provide such data as the independent expert may reasonably
                  require for the purposes of its determination.

      9.3.4 Where an independent expert has been appointed it shall review the
            calculation of Annual C provided by the Purchaser's Guarantor and
            any calculation of Annual C provided by the Seller. The Purchaser's
            Guarantor shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the
            independent expert will notify the Seller and the Purchaser's
            Guarantor in writing by no later than the date falling 1 month after
            the date of its appointment of its approval of the calculation of
            Annual C by the Purchaser's Guarantor or (if any) the Seller or
            (where it approves neither) its own determination of Annual C. If
            the independent expert fails to


                                                                              11
<PAGE>
            notify the Purchaser's Guarantor and the Seller as aforesaid, by the
            date falling 2 months after the date of its appointment then:-

            (A)   (save where paragraph (B) below applies), the average of the
                  respective estimates of Annual C prepared by the Purchaser's
                  Guarantor and the Seller, will thereupon be the Annual C, or
                  if no estimate has been provided by the Seller, the estimate
                  provided by the Purchaser's Guarantor will thereupon be Annual
                  C (such calculation or estimate being the "Provisional Annual
                  C"). Annual C or the Provisional Annual C shall, less any
                  Supplemental Security, (and subject as provided in Clause
                  9.3.5) determine the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit
                  to be provided for the remainder of the calendar year; and

            (B)   if an amount for Annual C has previously been determined and a
                  Letter of Credit is outstanding calculated by reference to it
                  or would have been but for a payment into the LC Trust Account
                  under clause 9.1, the Annual C shall remain at the level last
                  determined (such amount being the "Provisional Annual C").
                  Annual C or the Provisional Annual C shall, less any
                  Supplemental Security, (and subject as provided in Clause
                  9.3.5) determine the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit
                  to be provided for the following calendar year.

      In the event that the aggregate undrawn amount of the outstanding Letter
      of Credit issued pursuant to Clause 9.2, together with the Supplemental
      Security:-

            (C)   is less than the value of Provisional Annual C calculated in
                  accordance with Clause 9.4 the Purchaser's Guarantor shall,
                  within 3 months of the date of appointment of the independent
                  expert, deliver to the Seller a further Letter of Credit in an
                  amount which, when taken together with all other undrawn
                  amounts under any outstanding Letter of Credit and the
                  Supplemental Security, equals the value of the Provisional
                  Annual C; or

            (D)   is more than the calculated value of Provisional Annual C, the
                  Purchaser's Guarantor may, by the date of expiry of the
                  outstanding Letter of Credit, deliver to the Seller a Letter
                  of Credit in an amount which, together with the Supplemental
                  Security, equals the value of the Provisional Annual C and the
                  Seller shall promptly return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for
                  surrender, upon the receipt of the replacement Letter of
                  Credit, the Letter of Credit which has been replaced.


                                                                              12
<PAGE>
      9.3.5 If the independent expert notifies the Seller and the Purchaser's
            Guarantor that it has approved the calculation of Annual C of either
            the Seller or the Purchaser's Guarantor or has determined its own
            calculation of Annual C, then Annual C shall be the amount so
            approved or determined by the independent expert and where the
            amount so approved or determined is:

            (A)   greater than the value of the Interim C or Provisional Annual
                  C, then the Purchaser's Guarantor shall provide a further
                  Letter of Credit in a sum which, together with the
                  Supplemental Security, represents the difference between the
                  value of the Interim Annual C or Provisional Annual C (as the
                  case may be) and the amount so approved or determined as
                  Annual C by the expert, within one month of such notification
                  from the expert (or, if later, by no later than one month
                  prior to the date the new Annual C is to become effective); or

            (B)   is less than the value of Interim Annual C or the Provisional
                  Annual C, then the Purchaser's Guarantor may provide a Letter
                  of Credit in a sum, together with the Supplemental Security,
                  equal to the amount of the Annual C so approved or determined
                  by the expert and the Seller shall promptly return to the
                  Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender, upon the receipt of the
                  replacement Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit which has
                  been replaced.

      9.3.6 Each of "C", "Interim Annual C", "Annual C" and "Provisional Annual
            C" shall be determined in Sterling.

      9.3.7 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Purchaser's
            Guarantor fails to supply its calculation of Annual C to the Seller
            by the date specified in this Clause 9.3, then (without prejudice to
            any other remedies available to the Seller), for the relevant
            calendar year, the amount of Annual C shall be the then value of
            Interim Annual C.

9.4   Purchaser's Guarantor's obligation to provide further Letter of Credit for
      an increase in Annual C

      In the event that the aggregate undrawn amount of the outstanding Letter
      of Credit, together with the Supplemental Security:

      9.4.1 is less than the value of Annual C calculated in accordance with
            Clause 9.3, the Purchaser's Guarantor shall, by no later than one
            month prior to the date of expiry of the outstanding Letter of
            Credit, deliver to the Seller a further Letter of Credit in an
            amount which, when taken together with all other undrawn amounts
            under any outstanding Letter of Credit and the Supplemental
            Security, equals the value of the Annual C; or


                                                                              13
<PAGE>
      9.4.2 is more than the calculated value of the Annual C, the Purchaser's
            Guarantor may no later than one month prior to the date of expiry of
            the outstanding Letter of Credit, deliver to the Seller a Letter of
            Credit in an amount which, together with the Supplemental Security,
            equals the value of the Annual C and the Seller shall promptly
            return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender, upon the receipt
            of the replacement Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit which has
            been replaced.

            effect on one or more of the fields comprising the Interests or on
            the level of Abandonment Costs.

      (B)   If the Seller considers that an event has occurred which is
            reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Interests
            the Purchaser's Guarantor shall use its best endeavours to provide
            to the Seller in a timely manner data and information relating to
            the effect of the event on the Interests; and

      (C)   Within 5 London and New York business days of the filing with the
            Securities and Exchange Commission by the Purchaser's Guarantor of
            its audited annual consolidated accounts, the Purchaser's Guarantor
            will notify the Seller of the updated amount of Interim Annual C
            together with a certificate from an officer of the Purchaser's
            Guarantor confirming that such figure is the amount used by the
            Purchaser's Guarantor for the asset retirement obligations
            associated with the Interests for the purposes of its most recent
            annual audited financial statements, determined in accordance with
            generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

9.6   Obligation to produce Letter of Credit before expiry of then current

9.7   Reduction of undrawn amount under the Letter of Credit

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 9 the aggregate undrawn
      amount required to be outstanding at any time under the Letter of Credit

      agreement which governs the matters referred to in Clauses 9.7.1 and 9.7.2
      with all rights in respect of such matters only but with no obligations

      of its Affiliates and shall remain responsible for its obligations under
      this Clause 9 in respect of such part of the Interests as it has assigned

18.   RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

18.1  Subject to Clause 18.2, nothing in this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity is
      intended to confer on any person any right to enforce any term of this
      Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity which that person would not have had but

      Indemnity.



19.   APPOINTMENT OF AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS

19.1  The Purchaser's Guarantor irrevocably agrees that any writ, summons, claim
      form, order, judgment or other process issued out of the courts of England
      and Wales in connection with any proceedings arising out of or in
      connection with this Deed of Indemnity and Guarantee (a "Service
      Document") may be sufficiently and effectively served on it by service on
      the Purchaser's Solicitors, if no replacement agent has been appointed and
      notified to the Seller pursuant to sub-clause 19.4, or on the replacement
      agent if one has been appointed and notified to the Seller.

19.2  Any Service Document served pursuant to this clause shall be
      marked for the attention of:-

      19.2.1  Paul Griffin and Henry Davey at Herbert Smith, Exchange House,
              Primrose Street, London EC2A 2HS or such other address in England
              and Wales as may be notified to the Seller by Herbert Smith; or

      19.2.2  such other person as is appointed as agent for service pursuant to
              clause 19.4 at the address notified pursuant to clause 19.4.

19.3  Any Service Document addressed in accordance with clause 19.2 shall be
      deemed to have been duly served if left at the specified address, when it
      is left; or, if sent by first class post, two clear Business Days after
      the date of posting.


                                                                              22
<PAGE>
19.4  If the agent referred to in sub-clause 19.1 (or any replacement agent
      appointed pursuant to this sub-clause) at any time ceases for any reason
      (including its dissolution) to act as the Purchaser's Guarantor's agent
      for service, the Purchaser's Guarantor shall promptly appoint another
      person with an address for service in England and Wales to be the
      Purchaser's Guarantor's agent for service on the terms of this clause 19
      and promptly notify the Seller of the replacement's name and address.
      Failing such appointment and notification, the Seller shall be entitled by
      notice to the Purchaser's Guarantor to appoint such a replacement
      (including itself) on the replacement's standard or usual terms (if any)
      for such appointments to act on the Purchaser's Guarantor's behalf in
      accordance with this clause.
