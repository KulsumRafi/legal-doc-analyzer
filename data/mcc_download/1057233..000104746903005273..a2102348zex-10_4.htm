Guaranty; and all of the agreements and obligations under this Guaranty shall remain fully in effect until all such obligations and expenses finally shall have been paid in full. </FONT></P>

Guarantor, take any or all of the following actions without affecting the obligations of Guarantor hereunder: (a) retain or obtain a Lien upon or a security interest in any property to secure any of

any obligation hereunder; (c) extend or renew for one or more periods (regardless of whether longer than the original period), alter or exchange any of the Liabilities, or release or compromise any
obligation of Guarantor hereunder or any obligation of any nature of any other obligor including UCI with respect to any of the Liabilities; (d) release or fail to perfect its Lien upon or security
interest in, or impair, surrender, release or permit any substitution or exchange for, all or any part of any property securing any of the Liabilities or any obligation hereunder, or extend or renew
for one or more periods (regardless of whether longer than the original period) or release, compromise, alter or exchange any obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any such
property; and (e) resort to Guarantor for payment of any of the Liabilities, regardless of whether Beneficiary shall have resorted to any property securing any of the Liabilities or any obligation

Guaranty. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Liabilities shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the Indenture Trustee to be credited and applied upon the Liabilities, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the

acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) notice of the existence or creation or non-payment of all or any of the Liabilities; (c) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices
whatsoever (provided that nothing contained in this clause (c) shall affect any obligations to give notice or make demand as set forth in the Management Agreement); and (d) all diligence in collection
or protection of or realization upon the Liabilities or any thereof, any obligation hereunder, or any security for or guaranty of any of the foregoing. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, Guarantor agrees not to assert, and hereby waives for the benefit of each Beneficiary, all rights (whether by counterclaim, setoff or otherwise) and defenses (including, without limitation, the
defense of fraud or fraud in the inducement), whether acquired by subrogation, assignment or otherwise, to the extent that such rights and defenses may be available to Guarantor to avoid payment of
its obligations under this Guaranty in accordance with the express provisions of this Guaranty. </FONT></P>

8.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconditional Nature of Guaranty.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty shall constitute a guaranty of payment or of
performance and not of collection, and the Guarantor specifically agrees that it shall not be necessary, and that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to require, before or as a condition of enforcing
the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or requiring payment or performance of the Liabilities by the Guarantor hereunder, or at any time thereafter, that any Person: (a) file suit or
proceed to obtain or assert a claim for personal judgment against UCI or any other Person that may be liable for any Liabilities; (b) make any other effort to obtain payment or performance of any
Liabilities from UCI or any other Person that may be liable for such Liabilities; (c) foreclose against or seek to realize upon any security now or hereafter existing for such Liabilities; (d)
exercise or assert any other right or remedy to which such Person is or may be entitled in connection with any Liabilities or any security or other guaranty therefor; or (e) assert or file any claim
against the assets of UCI or any other Person liable for any Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no provision of this Guaranty shall require the Guarantor to pay, perform or
discharge any Liabilities prior to the time such Liabilities are due and payable. No delay on any Beneficiary's part in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no
single or partial exercise by any Beneficiary of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy; nor shall any modification or waiver
of any of the provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon Beneficiary except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed by each Beneficiary. The Beneficiaries may in all events pursue their
rights under this Guaranty prior to or simultaneously with pursuing their various rights referred to in the Management Agreement, as the Beneficiaries may determine. No action of any Beneficiary
permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any Beneficiary's rights or Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty. For the purposes of this Guaranty, Liabilities shall include all of UCI's
obligations under the Management Agreement, notwithstanding any right or power
of UCI or anyone else to assert any claim or defense as to the invalidity or unenforceability of any such obligation, and no such claim or defense shall affect or impair the obligations of Guarantor
hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantor are unlimited in amount (but not greater than the Liabilities plus costs and expenses payable hereunder) and shall be continuing and irrevocable, absolute
and unconditional, primary, original and immediate and not contingent and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to and not be released, discharged or in any way affected by any
