purpose of the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is           to
provide a means by which employees of Scientific Learning Corporation, a
          Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and its Affiliates, as defined
          in subparagraph 1(b), which are designated as provided in subparagraph 2(b),
may           be given an opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company.  </FONT></P>

subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections
          424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended

plan&#148; as that term is defined in Section 423(b) of the Code.  </FONT></P>
