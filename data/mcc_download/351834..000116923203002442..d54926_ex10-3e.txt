                                   SECTION 3

                                      -37-

3.2   AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT FACILITIES.

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement:

      (a)   FACILITY A. The Facility A Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
            under Facility A up to the lesser of the Facility A Borrowing Base
            and a maximum principal amount of $5,000,000.

      (b)   FACILITY B. Sunrich Food Group may borrow, repay and reborrow under
            Facility B up to the lesser of the Facility B Borrowing Base and a
            maximum principal amount of US$9,000,000.

      (c)   FACILITY C. LP may borrow by way of a single drawdown under Facility
            C up to a maximum principal amount of US$21,700,000.

      (d)   TYPES OF ADVANCES. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement:

            (i)   BMO agrees to make Facility A available by way of Prime Loans,
                  USBR Loans, Bankers' Acceptance, Letters of Credit or Letters
                  of Guarantee;

            (ii)  Harris agrees to make Facility B available by way of Alternate
                  Base Rate Loans, Libor Loans or Letters of Credit; and

            (iii) each Lender agrees to severally make its Facility C Commitment
                  available to LP by way of Alternate Base Rate Loans or Libor
                  Loans.

3.3   OBLIGATIONS OF THE LENDERS UNDER FACILITY C.

      (a)   RATEABLE PORTION. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
            Agreement, each Lender under Facility C agrees to make available its
            Rateable Portion of each Advance to the Borrower. No Lender shall be
            responsible for a Facility C Commitment of any other Lender. The
            failure of a Lender to make available an Advance under Facility C in
            accordance with its obligations under this Agreement shall not
            release any other Lender from its obligations. Notwithstanding
            anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Lender shall be
            obligated to make Advances available under Facility C to the
            Borrower in excess of its Facility C Commitment.

      (b)   SEPARATE OBLIGATION. The obligation of each Lender to make its
            Facility C Commitment available to LP is a separate obligation
            between each Lender and LP, and that obligation is not the several
            or joint and several obligation of any other Lender.

3.4   REVOLVING NATURE OF FACILITY A AND FACILITY B.

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement:

      (a)   FACILITY A. The Facility A Borrower may increase or reduce the
            amount of Advances outstanding under Facility A by borrowing,
            repaying and reborrowing Prime Loans and USBR Loans, by causing the
            acceptance of Bankers' Acceptances and funding them at maturity, and
            by causing the issue and re-issue of Letters of Credit or Letters of
            Guarantee from time to time.

                                      -38-

      (b)   FACILITY B. Sunrich Food Group may increase or reduce the amount of
            Advances outstanding under Facility B by borrowing, repaying and
            reborrowing Alternate Base Rate Loans and Libor Loans and by causing
            the issue and re-issue of Letters of Credit from time to time.

3.5   PURPOSE.

      (a)   FACILITY A. The proceeds of Advances made by BMO under Facility A
            shall be used by the Facility A Borrower solely to provide for the
            ongoing general corporate and working capital purposes of the
            Facility A Borrower and its Subsidiaries and divisions.

      (b)   FACILITY B. The proceeds of Advances made by Harris under Facility B
            shall be used by Sunrich Food Group solely to provide for the
            ongoing general corporate and working capital purposes of Sunrich
            Food Group and its Subsidiaries and divisions and to refinance
            certain of Opta's existing Debt.

      (c)   FACILITY C. The proceeds of the single Advance made by the Lenders,
            through their respective United States branches, under Facility C
            shall be used by LP primarily to indirectly refinance certain
            existing indebtedness and to repay the Tender Facility in full. For
            greater certainty, the proceeds of the Advance under Facility C
            shall be used by the LP primarily to subscribe for a wholly-owned
            equity interest in ULC which in turn will use the proceeds of such
            equity injection to subscribe for a wholly-owned equity interest in
            LLC which in turn will use the proceeds from such equity injection
            to make a secured loan to Sunrich Food Group and/or Opta for the
            purpose of refinancing existing Debt of Sunrich Food Group, its
            Subsidiaries, Opta and its Subsidiaries.

            a Borrowing Base Certificate in form and substance satisfactory to
            Harris in its sole discretion.

      (c)   FACILITY C. Only one Advance is available under Facility C. The
            Advance shall be based upon written payout statements, satisfactory
            to the Agent, from those creditors identified by the Agent
            evidencing the amount of the existing debt to and an undertaking to
            release and discharge all security held by such creditors and shall
            be paid, subject to Section 3.3 hereof, by the Agent on behalf of
            the Lenders directly to LP. Any unused portion of the Total Facility
            C Commitment shall be cancelled immediately upon the making of the

            required payment, payment of its Obligations to the applicable
            Lender with respect to that maturing Libor Loan shall be funded with
            an Advance under, as applicable, a USBR Loan or Alternate Base Rate

            availability.

      (c)   DISCOUNT RATE. On each Drawdown Date on which Bankers' Acceptances
            are to be accepted, BMO shall advise the Borrower as to the Lender's
            determination of the

<PAGE>

                                      -41-

            applicable Discount Rate for the Bankers' Acceptances which the
            Lender has agreed to purchase.

      (d)   PURCHASE. If the Lender purchases a Bankers' Acceptance accepted by
            it, the Borrower shall sell and the Lender shall purchase the
            Bankers' Acceptance at the applicable Discount Rate. The Lender
            shall provide to the Borrower's Account the Discount Proceeds less
            the Acceptance Fee payable with respect to that Bankers' Acceptance.

      (e)   SALE. The Lender may from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or
            otherwise dispose of any or all Bankers' Acceptances accepted and

      (f)   BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES IN BLANK. To facilitate the acceptance of
            Bankers' Acceptances under this Agreement, the Borrowers shall, upon
            execution of this Agreement, if so requested by the Lender, and from
            time to time as required, provide to the Lender Bankers' Acceptances
            substantially in the form as may be acceptable to the Lender duly
            executed and endorsed in blank by the Borrowers, in quantities
            sufficient for the Lender to fulfill its obligations under this
            Agreement or, if so requested by the Lender, provide to the Lender,
            a power of attorney substantially in the form of Schedule O executed
            by the Borrowers in favour of the Lender authorizing the Lender to
            execute drafts in the form attached thereto. If Bankers' Acceptances
            have been provided to the Lender duly executed and endorsed in blank
            by the Borrowers, the Lender is hereby authorized to issue Bankers'
            Acceptances endorsed in blank in face amounts as may be determined
            by the Borrowers provided that the aggregate amount thereof is equal
            to the aggregate amount of Bankers' Acceptances required to be
            accepted by the Lender. The Lender shall not be responsible or
            liable for its failure to accept a Bankers' Acceptance as required
            under this Agreement if the cause of the failure is, in whole or in
            part, due to the failure of the Borrowers to provide to the Lender
            on a timely basis a sufficient number of duly executed Bankers'
            Acceptances or a duly executed power of attorney, as applicable, nor
            shall the Lender be liable for any damage, loss or other claim
            arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any Bankers'
            Acceptance except a loss or improper use arising by reason of the
            gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender or its
            employees.

      (g)   EXECUTION. Drafts drawn by a Borrower to be accepted as Bankers'
            Acceptances shall be signed by a duly authorized officer or officers
            of the Borrower or by its attorneys. Notwithstanding that any Person
            whose signature appears on any Bankers' Acceptance may no longer be
            an authorized signatory for the Borrower at the time of issuance of
            a Bankers' Acceptance, that signature shall nevertheless be valid
            and sufficient for all purposes as if the authority had remained in
            force at the time of issuance and any Bankers' Acceptance so signed
            shall be binding on the Borrower.

      (h)   ROLLOVER. At or before 1:00 p.m. two Business Days before the
            maturity date of any Bankers' Acceptance, the Borrower shall give to
            the Lender written notice substantially in the form attached as
            Schedule N if the Borrowers intends to repay the maturing Bankers'
            Acceptances on the maturity date or if the Borrower intends to issue
            Bankers' Acceptances on the maturity date to provide for the payment
            of the maturing Bankers' Acceptances. Otherwise, the Borrower shall
            provide payment to

<PAGE>

                                      -42-

            the Lender of an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
            the Bankers' Acceptances issued by the Borrower on their maturity
            date. If the Borrower fails to make the payment, the Borrower's
            obligations in respect of the maturing Bankers' Acceptances shall be
            deemed to have been converted on the maturity date thereof into
            Prime Loans.

      (i)   WAIVER OF PRESENTMENT AND OTHER CONDITIONS. Each Borrower waives
            presentment for payment and any other defence to payment of any
            amounts due to the Lender in respect of a Bankers' Acceptance
            accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might
            exist solely by reason of the Bankers' Acceptance being held, at the
            maturity thereof, by the Lender in its own right and each Borrower
            agrees not to claim any days of grace if the Lender as holder sues
            the Borrower on the Bankers' Acceptance for payment thereunder.

      (j)   DEPOSITORY BILLS AND NOTES ACT. At the option of the Borrowers and
            the Lender, Bankers' Acceptances under this Agreement to be accepted
            by the Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for
            deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant
            to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All depository bills
            so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 3.9.

3.10  LETTERS OF CREDIT AND LETTERS OF GUARANTEE.

      (a)   CURRENCY. Each Letter of Credit and each Letter of Guarantee shall
            be issued in Canadian Dollars, US Dollars or such other currency as
            the Lender may agree in its sole discretion and shall mature on a
            Business Day. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for greater
            certainty, Harris will only issue Letters of Credit denominated in
            US Dollars.

      (b)   LETTER OF CREDIT AND LETTER OF GUARANTEE SUBLIMIT. The aggregate
            principal amount of Advances which may be outstanding by way of
            Letter of Credit and Letter of Guarantee under Facility A shall not
            exceed $3,000,000. The aggregate principal amount of Advances which
            may be outstanding by way of Letter of Credit under Facility B shall
            not exceed US$2,500,000.

      (c)   NO GUARANTEES. No Advance by way of the issue of a Letter of Credit
            or Letter of Guarantee shall be used by the Borrowers for the
            purpose of incurring Contingent Obligations of the type described in
            clause (a) of the definition of "Contingent Obligations".

      (d)   OTHER DOCUMENTATION. The issue of a Letter of Credit or a Letter of
            Guarantee is subject to the execution and delivery of an application
            and agreement and an indemnity in the Lender's standard form or
            other specific agreement relative to the instrument in form and
            substance satisfactory to the Lender acting reasonably (the "L/C
            Agreement").

      (e)   RETIREMENT. A Letter of Credit or Letter of Guarantee may only be
            retired on its maturity date unless and to the extent it has been
            honoured or unless the written consent of the beneficiary of the
            instrument has been obtained and the original instrument has been

            of Bankers' Acceptances to the Borrowers having the same maturity
            date;

            to the extent that the conditions outlined in Section 4.11 shall not
            exist on the relevant Conversion Date; and

      (f)   no demand shall have been made and no Default or Event of Default
            shall have occurred and be continuing on the relevant Conversion

of a Contract Period, as regards a Libor Loan, or upon the maturity date, as

Acceptances, the Borrower shall be

<PAGE>

those accounts by appropriate entries all amounts owing on account of those
Obligations and all payments on account thereof. Those accounts and records will
constitute, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive evidence of the
Obligations outstanding from time to time, the date each Advance was made and
the amounts that each Borrower has paid from time to time on account of the
Obligations.

4.8   INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS.

The Borrowers shall pay to BMO in respect of Facility A, to Harris in respect of
Facility B and to the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in respect of Facility C

the US Base Rate plus the applicable margin for the then current Pricing Level

<PAGE>

                                      -49-

payable upon demand by BMO in respect of Facility A, Harris in respect of
Facility B and the Agent in respect of Facility C and shall be compounded on
each Interest Payment Date.

4.9   INTEREST ACT.

For purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), where in this Agreement a rate of
interest is to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360, 365, or 366 days,
the yearly rate of interest to which the rate is equivalent is that rate
multiplied by the number of days in the calendar year for which the calculation
is made and divided by 360, 365, or 366, as applicable.

4.10  LIMIT ON RATE OF INTEREST.

      (a)   ADJUSTMENT. If any provision of this Agreement or any of the other
            Documents would obligate a Borrower or Obligor to make any payment
            of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or
            calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would
            result in a receipt by that Lender of interest at a criminal rate
            (as construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then
            notwithstanding that provision, that amount or rate shall be deemed
            to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount
            or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so
            prohibited by law or result in a receipt by that Lender of interest
            at a criminal rate, the adjustment to be effected, to the extent
            necessary, as follows:

            (i)   first, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to
                  be paid to the affected Lender under this Section 4; and

            (ii)  thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and
                  other amounts required to be paid to the affected Lender which
                  would constitute interest for purposes of the Criminal Code
                  (Canada).

      (b)   REIMBURSEMENT. Notwithstanding Section 4.10(a), and after giving
            effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall
            have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by the
            Criminal Code (Canada), then the applicable Borrower shall be
            entitled, by notice in writing to the affected Lender, to obtain
            reimbursement from that Lender in an amount equal to the excess, and
            pending reimbursement, the amount of the excess shall be deemed to
            be an amount payable by that Lender to the applicable Borrower.

      (c)   ACTUARIAL PRINCIPLES. Any amount or rate of interest referred to in
            this Section 4.10 shall be determined in accordance with generally
            accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual
            rate of interest over the term that any Advance remains outstanding
            on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall
            within the meaning of "interest" (as defined in the Criminal Code
            (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be
            pro-rated over that period of time and otherwise be pro-rated over
            the period from the earlier of the date of advance and the Closing
            Date to the relevant Maturity Date and, in the event of a dispute, a
            certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries
            appointed by the Lender shall be conclusive for the purposes of that
            determination.

4.11  SUBSTITUTE BASIS OF ADVANCE - LIBOR LOANS.

If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, a Lender acting in good faith
determines (which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower) that:

      (a)   adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of
            interest on a Libor Loan;

      (b)   LIBOR does not accurately reflect the effective cost to the Lender
            of making, funding or maintaining a Libor Loan and the costs to the
            Lender are increased or the income receivable by the Lender is
            reduced in respect of a Libor Loan;

      (c)   the making, funding or maintaining of a Libor Loan or a portion
            thereof by the Lender has become impracticable by reason of
            circumstances which materially and adversely affect the London
            interbank market; or

      (d)   deposits in US Dollars are not available to the Lender in the London
            interbank market in sufficient amounts in the ordinary course of
            business for the applicable Contract Period to make, fund or
            maintain a Libor Loan during the Contract Period;

the Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower setting forth the basis of that
determination and each Borrower hereby instructs the Lender to repay the
affected Libor Loan with the proceeds of an Alternate Base Rate Loan in the
amount of the Libor Loan, to be drawn down on the last day of the then current
Contract Period. The Lender shall not be required to make any further Libor
Loans available under this Agreement so long as any of the circumstances
referred to in this Section 4.11 continue.

4.12  INDEMNITY.

      (a)   GENERAL. Each Obligor shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally
            indemnify the Agent, each Lender and the US Security Agent and their
            respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents
            (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against all suits, actions,
            proceedings, claims, losses (other than loss of profits), expenses
            (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel),
            damages and liabilities including liabilities arising under
            Environmental Laws (each, a "CLAIM") that the Agent, each Lender or
            the US Security Agent may sustain or incur as a consequence of (i)
            any default under this Agreement or any other Document, (ii) any
            misrepresentation contained in any writing delivered to the Agent,
            each Lender or the US Security Agent in connection with this
            Agreement, (iii) the Agent, each Lender or the US Security Agent
            entering into this Agreement, (iv) the use of proceeds of the Credit
            Facilities, or (v) the operations of any of the Obligors or any
            Affiliate of any of the Obligors, except that no Indemnified Person
            will be indemnified for any Claim resulting from its own gross
            negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
            for greater certainty, the obligations of Temisca with respect the
            indebtedness or liability of other Obligors to the Agent, the US
            Security Agent and each Lender shall be limited and governed by the
            Limited Guarantee dated as of the date hereof executed by Temisca in
            favour of the Agent for and on behalf of the Lenders.

<PAGE>

                                      -51-

      (b)   CERTIFICATE. A certificate of the Agent, affected Lender or US
            Security Agent, as applicable, setting out the basis for the
            determination of the amount necessary to indemnify the relevant
            Person pursuant to this Section 4.12 shall be conclusive evidence,
            absent manifest error, of the correctness of that determination.

      (c)   SURVIVAL. It is the intention of each of the Obligors and the Agent,
            each Lender and the US Security Agent, as applicable, that Sections
            3.15, 4.12, 4.13 and 6.2(b) shall supersede any other provisions in
            this Agreement which in any way limit the liability of any of the
            Obligors and that each of the Obligors shall be liable for any
            obligations arising under Sections 3.15, 4.12, 4.13 and 6.2(b) even
            if the amount of the liability incurred exceeds the amount of the
            other Obligations. The obligations of the Obligors under these
            Sections are joint and several and absolute and unconditional and
            shall not be affected by any act, omission or circumstance
            whatsoever, whether or not occasioned by the fault of the Agent, any
            Lender or the US Security Agent, except in respect of gross
            negligence or willful misconduct by it. The obligations of each of
            the Obligors under Sections 3.15, 4.12, 4.13 and 6.2(b) shall
            survive the repayment of the other Obligations and the termination
            of the Credit Facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for
            greater certainty, the obligations of Temisca with respect the
            indebtedness or liability of other Obligors to the Agent, the US
            Security Agent and each Lender shall be limited and governed by the
            Limited Guarantee dated as of the date hereof executed by Temisca in
            favour of the Agent for and on behalf of the Lenders.

4.13  BREAKAGE COSTS

      (a)   The Facility A Borrower may not repay, prepay or cancel an Advance
            by way of Bankers' Acceptances prior to the expiry of the Contract
            Period relating thereto.

      (b)   If a Borrower repays, prepays or cancels an Advance (including
            repayment pursuant to Sections 4.11 and 5.3), by way of Libor Loan,
            Letter of Credit or Letter of Guarantee, the Borrower shall
            indemnify the applicable Lender for any loss or expense suffered or
            incurred by that Lender including any loss of profit or expenses
            which the Lender incurs by reason of the liquidation or redeployment
            of deposits or other funds acquired by it to effect or maintain the
            Advance or any interest or other charges payable to lenders of funds
            borrowed by the Lender in order to maintain the Advance together
            with any other charges, costs or expenses incurred by that Lender
            relative thereto.

      (c)   A certificate of the Agent or the affected Lender setting out the
            basis for the determination of the amount necessary to indemnify the
            Agent or the affected Lender pursuant to this Section 4.13 shall be
            conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, of the correctness of
            that determination.

4.14  CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.

      (a)   REDUCTION IN RATE OF RETURN. If at any time any Lender determines,
            acting reasonably, that any change in any Applicable Law or any
            interpretation thereof after the date of this Agreement, or
            compliance by the Lender with any direction, requirement, guidelines
            or policies or request from any regulatory authority given after the
            date of this Agreement, whether or not having the force of law, has
            or

<PAGE>

                                      -52-

            would have, as a consequence of a Lender's obligation under this
            Agreement, and taking into consideration the Lender's policies with
            respect to capital adequacy, the effect of reducing the rate of
            return on the Lender's capital (in respect of making, maintaining or
            funding an Advance hereunder) to a level below that which the Lender
            would have achieved but for the change or compliance, then from time
            to time, upon demand of the Lender, the Borrower shall pay the
            Lender such additional amounts as will compensate the Lender for the
            reduction.

      (b)   TAXES, RESERVES, CAPITAL ADEQUACY, ETC. If, after the date of this
            Agreement, the introduction of any Applicable Law or any change or
            introduction of a change in any Applicable Law (whether or not
            having the force of law) or in the interpretation or application
            thereof by any court or by any Governmental Authority, central bank
            or other authority or entity charged with the administration
            thereof, or any change in the compliance of any Lender therewith now
            or hereafter:

            (i)   subjects any Lender to, or causes the withdrawal or
                  termination of a previously granted exemption with respect to,
                  any Tax or changes the basis of taxation, or increases any
                  existing Tax on payments of principal, interest, fees or other
                  amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lender under or by
                  virtue of this Agreement (except for Excluded Taxes); or

            (ii)  imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special
                  deposit, deposit insurance or similar requirement against
                  assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans
                  by or any other acquisition of funds by, an office of any
                  Lender in respect of any Advance or any other condition with
                  respect to this Agreement;

                  and the result of any of the foregoing, in the sole
                  determination of the Lender acting reasonably, shall be to
                  increase the cost to, or reduce the amount received or
                  receivable by the Lender or its effective rate of return in
                  respect of making, maintaining or funding an Advance
                  hereunder, the Lender shall, acting reasonably, determine that
                  amount of money which shall compensate the Lender for the
                  increase in cost or reduction in income.

      (c)   PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION. Upon a Lender having determined
            that it is entitled to compensation in accordance with the
            provisions of this Section 4.14 ("ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION"), the
            Lender shall promptly so notify the Borrower and (if a Lender under
            Facility C) the Agent and shall provide to the Borrower and the
            Agent a photocopy of the relevant Applicable Law or direction,
            requirement, guideline, policy or request, as applicable, and a
            certificate of an officer of the Lender setting forth the Additional
            Compensation and the basis of calculation thereof, which shall be
            conclusive evidence of the Additional Compensation in the absence of
            manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender within 30
            Business Days of the giving of notice the Additional Compensation
            for the account of the Lender accruing from the date of the
            notification. The Lender shall be entitled to be paid Additional
            Compensation from time to time to the extent that the provisions of
            this Section 4.14 are then applicable notwithstanding that the
            Lender has previously been paid Additional Compensation.

<PAGE>

                                      -53-

      (d)   COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE. If it is commercially reasonable in the
            opinion of a Lender receiving Additional Compensation under this
            Section 4.14, the Lender shall make reasonable efforts to limit the
            incidence of that Additional Compensation, including seeking
            recovery for the account of the Borrower following the Borrower's
            request and at the Borrower's expense, if the Lender, in its sole
            determination, would suffer no appreciable economic, legal,
            regulatory or other disadvantage as a result.

4.15  PAYMENT OF PORTION.

Notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, if a Lender gives
the notice provided for in Section 4.14 with respect to any Advance by way of
Loan (an "AFFECTED BORROWING"), the Borrower may, at its option, upon 60
Business Days notice to that Lender (which notice shall be irrevocable), repay
to the Lender in full the Affected Borrowing outstanding together with accrued
and unpaid interest on the principal amount so repaid up to the date of
repayment and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.13, together with such
Additional Compensation as may be applicable to the date of payment.

4.16  ILLEGALITY.

If any Applicable Law, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
application thereof by any court or by any Governmental Authority or central
bank or comparable agency or any other entity charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or
direction (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency or other entity, now or hereafter
makes it unlawful or impossible for the Lender to make, fund or maintain an
Advance or to perform its obligations under or by virtue of this Agreement, the
Lender may, by written notice thereof to the Borrower and (if a Lender under
Facility C) the Agent, terminate its obligations to make further Advances under
this Agreement, and the Borrower, if required by the Lender, shall repay
forthwith (or at the end of such longer period as the Lender in its discretion
has agreed) the principal amount of the Advance together with accrued interest
without penalty or bonus (and in the case of Bankers' Acceptances, the face
amount thereof) and such Additional Compensation as may be applicable to the
date of payment and all other outstanding Obligations to the Lender. If any
change shall only affect a portion of any Lender's obligations under this
Agreement which is, in the opinion of the Lender, severable from the remainder
of this Agreement so that the remainder of this Agreement may be continued in
full force and effect without otherwise affecting any of the obligations of the
Lender or the Borrower under this Agreement, the Lender shall only declare its
obligations under that portion so terminated.

                                   SECTION 5
                             REDUCTION AND REPAYMENT

5.1   PAYMENT ON DEMAND OR AT MATURITY.

Facility A is payable by the Facility A Borrower immediately on demand by BMO at
its option at any time and from time to time without any other or further notice
notwithstanding the conformity or not of the Obligors to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or any other Documents and whether or not a Default
or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or has been waived. The
term of each of Facility B and Facility C shall commence on the Closing Date and
end on the Maturity Date. For greater certainty, all amounts outstanding under
each of Facility B and Facility C must be repaid and all obligations of, as
applicable, Harris under Facility B and each Lender under Facility C must be
fully funded or cancelled on the Maturity Date. At least 60 days, but not

<PAGE>

                                      -54-

greater than 90 days, prior to the then current Maturity Date in respect of
Facility B, Sunrich Food Group may, if it so desires, provide Harris with
written notice of a request to extend the current Maturity Date for a further
period of 364 days. Each request for the extension of the then current Maturity
Date by Sunrich Food Group shall be subject to the written consent of Harris,
which consent, if delivered, shall be delivered to Sunrich Food Group no later
than 30 days prior to the then current Maturity Date. If Harris, acting in its
sole discretion, agrees to Sunrich Food Group's request to extend the then
current Maturity Date, the then current Maturity Date shall be extended for a
further period of 364 days. If Harris does not respond to a request for an
extension prior to 30 days before the expiry of the then current Maturity Date,
Harris will be deemed to have denied the request for an extension of the
Maturity Date.

5.2   REPAYMENT.

LP shall repay the principal amount of the Advances under Facility C quarterly,
commencing the first Fiscal Quarter after the Closing Date, by paying the
amounts set out in the amortization schedule attached as Schedule P. In
addition, 100% of the net cash proceeds from the permitted sale or
sale/leaseback of any fixed assets (other than Opta's head office) of the
Obligors (collectively, the "PERMITTED PROCEEDS") shall be applied to repay, in
inverse order of maturity, on or before the last Business Day of the Fiscal
Quarter immediately following the Fiscal Quarter in which such sale or
sale/leaseback occurs, the then outstanding principal amount under Facility C,
until Facility C is repaid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
Permitted Proceeds are reinvested by the applicable Obligor, as applicable, in
replacement assets in existing lines of business by the end of the Fiscal
Quarter immediately following the Fiscal Quarter in which such permitted sale or
sale/leaseback of assets takes place, then the Permitted Proceeds need not be
applied to the outstanding principal amount under Facility C as set out herein.

5.3   MANDATORY REPAYMENT - CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

      (a)   If, due to exchange rate fluctuations or for any reason whatsoever,
            in the case of Facility A, the Canadian Dollar Amount of the
            principal amount of all Advances outstanding under Facility A shall,
            at any time, exceed the Commitment for Facility A (the amount of the
            excess being referred to herein as an "EXCESS AMOUNT"), then within
            three Business Days of written notice from BMO, the Facility A
            Borrower shall, at its option:

            (i)   forthwith repay Loans and/or fund BMO's obligations with
                  respect to outstanding Bankers' Acceptances, Letters of Credit
                  or Letters of Guarantee in an amount equal to or greater than
                  such Excess Amount; or

            (ii)  provide cash collateral or such other security as BMO may
                  require in an amount equal to or greater than such Excess
                  Amount which collateral shall remain in BMO's possession until
                  the Canadian Dollar Amount of the principal amount of all
                  Advances outstanding under Facility A is equal to or less than
                  the Commitment for Facility A whereupon such collateral shall
                  be released by BMO to the Borrowers.

      (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including any
            provision contemplating a Rollover or Conversion, whenever the
            Canadian Dollar Amount of the principal amount of all Advances
            outstanding under Facility A is in excess of the Commitment for
            Facility A, the Facility A Borrower shall (i) repay any USBR Loan

<PAGE>

                                      -55-

            or (ii) upon the maturity of any Banker's Acceptance, repay the
            Banker's Acceptance, or (iii) upon the last day of the Contract
            Period in respect of a Libor Loan, repay the Libor Loan, and any
            repayments under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be applied in
            reduction of such Excess Amount.

      (c)   The Facility A Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse BMO for and hold
            BMO harmless against any loss, cost or expense suffered or incurred
            by BMO by virtue of the necessity to resort to this Section 5.3
            including any loss of profit or expenses which BMO incurs by reason
            of the liquidation or re-deployment of deposits or other funds
            acquired by BMO to maintain its obligations under this Agreement and
            any interest or other charges payable to BMO of funds borrowed by
            BMO in order to maintain the obligations of BMO under this
            Agreement.

      (d)   The Facility A Borrower shall pay interest on any Excess Amount at a
            rate of Prime Rate plus 5% per annum, calculated on a daily basis on
            the actual number of days elapsed in a 365 day year, computed from
            the date an Excess Amount arises to, but excluding, the date on
            which the Excess Amount is repaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
            the Facility A Borrower is aware that it will require an Excess
            Amount for a period not longer than three Business Days, the
            Facility A Borrower may request that such Excess Amount be made
            available at the rate normally applicable to Facility A for such
            anticipated short term requirement. BMO may refuse such a request in
            its discretion.

5.4   OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT.

LP may prepay, without penalty, in whole or in part and in a minimum amount of
US$100,000 or larger whole multiples thereof, the Advances outstanding under
Facility C, at any time prior to the Maturity Date provided that all accrued
interest with respect to the amount to be prepaid shall have been paid and
provided that LP indemnify the Agent on behalf of the Lenders for any loss or
expense suffered or incurred by any Lender, including any breakage costs which a
Lender incurs by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other
funds acquired by it to effect or maintain Facility C or any interest or charges
payable to the lender of funds borrowed by the Lender and any other charges,
costs or expenses incurred by the Lender relative thereto. LP shall give three
Business Days' notice of its desire to make any prepayment, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Schedule Q. Any prepayment shall be paid to the Agent at
the Agent's Account for Payments and distributed pro rata among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Rateable Portions and applied pro rata over the
remaining Scheduled Payments under Facility C. No amount permanently prepaid may
be reborrowed under this Agreement. Each Lender's Facility C Commitment will be
permanently reduced by the amount of any permanent prepayment made to it under
this Section 5 and the Total Facility C Commitment reduced correspondingly.

5.5   PAYMENT OF BEDFORD PROCEEDS.

If Bedford Proceeds arise prior to such time that the Unanimous Lenders consent
to the repayment of all or a portion of the Claridge Debt by Stake with such
Bedford Proceeds, then such Bedford Proceeds shall, at the option of Stake on
notice to the Agent and the Lenders, be dealt with as follows: (i) Stake may
invest or place all or any portion of such Bedford Proceeds in Cash Equivalents
as contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) Sunrich Food Group may use all or any
portion of such Bedford Proceeds to repay the principal amount of Advances
outstanding under Facility B. If Sunrich Food Group chooses to repay Advances
outstanding under Facility B, then

<PAGE>

                                      -56-

the aggregate amount of credit available under Facility B will be reduced by an
amount equal to the amount of such repayment by Sunrich Food Group with the
Bedford Proceeds (the "FACILITY B REPAYMENT AMOUNT"). For greater certainty, the
amount of credit available to Sunrich Food Group under Facility B during the
period of any such repayment of Facility B with Bedford Proceeds will,
notwithstanding Section 3.2(b) hereof, be equal to, and not at any time exceed,
the lesser of (a) the Facility B Borrowing Base less the Facility B Repayment
Amount and (b) the Commitment of Harris under Facility B less the Facility B
Repayment Amount. If the Unanimous Lenders subsequently consent to the repayment
of all or any portion of the Claridge Debt by Stake, then Stake will use the
Bedford Proceeds to make such payment of the Claridge Debt. To the extent that
repayment of the Claridge Debt is to be made by Stake with Bedford Proceeds that
were previously used to repay Advances outstanding under Facility B, then Harris
(provided that no Default or Event of Default exists and that Sunrich Food Group

      (n)   ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. It will carry on all activities in
            compliance with all Environmental Laws. It will not cause or permit
            the Release or storage of a Hazardous Substance in or under its

            comes to its attention that it is not in material compliance with
            all applicable Environmental Laws, it will remedy that
            non-compliance immediately. If immediate remedy is not possible, it
            will notify BMO, Harris and the Agent immediately of the problem and

            ERISA, (c) the taking of any action with respect to a US Pension
            Plan which is reasonably likely to result in the requirement that

            (d) the occurrence of any event with respect to any ERISA Plan which

9.2   NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

While any amount owing under this Agreement or any of the other Documents
remains unpaid, or the Agent, the US Security Agent or the Lenders have any
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Documents, each Obligor
covenants, for itself as applicable, with the Agent, the US Security Agent and
each Lender as follows:

      (a)   LIMITATION ON LIENS. It shall not directly or indirectly, make,
            create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with
            respect to any material part of its property or assets, whether now
            owned or hereafter acquired, other than Permitted Liens. The ability
            of the Obligors to incur or suffer to exist Permitted Liens is not
            to be construed as a subordination, constructive or otherwise, of
            the Liens granted to the Agent or US Security Agent on behalf of the
            Lenders to such Permitted Liens.

      (b)   DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. It shall not sell, lease, transfer, assign,
            convey or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets
            except in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the
            terms of the Security Documents unless the Permitted Proceeds of
            such sale are applied as set out in Section 5.2.

      (c)   CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS. It shall not merge, consolidate,
            amalgamate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
            dispose of (whether in one transaction or in a series of
            transactions) all or substantially all of its assets (whether now
            owned or hereafter acquired) to or in favour of any Person, except
            that any Obligor may merge, amalgamate with, or dissolve or
            liquidate into, any other Obligor (so long as it remains an
            Obligor), provided that in any such transaction, other than an
            amalgamation, the Obligor shall be the continuing or surviving
            corporation.

      (d)   LIMITATION ON DEBT. It shall not create, incur, assume, suffer to
            exist, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable
            with respect to, any Debt in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate
            during the term of this Agreement, except: (i) Debt incurred
            pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) Debt consisting of Contingent
            Obligations described in clause (b) of the definition thereof and
            permitted pursuant to Section 9.2(g); (iii) Debt existing on the
            date of the Closing Date as set forth in Schedule R; (iv) Debt
            secured by or which could be secured by Permitted Liens; (v) Debt
            for amounts payable to suppliers in the ordinary course of business;
            (vi) unsecured Debt to an Obligor; (vii) Debt of Temisca in respect
            of the Class H Shares in the capital of Temisca in the maximum
            aggregate amount of $55,000 and (vii) Debt incurred pursuant to the
            Claridge Debenture.

      (e)   TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES OR ASSOCIATES. It shall not enter into
            any transactions with any Affiliate or Associate of it, except: (i)
            as expressly permitted by this Agreement or listed on Schedule S
            hereto; or (ii) in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to
            the reasonable requirements of its business; and, in the case of
            clause (ii), upon fair and reasonable terms no less favourable to it
            than would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a
            Person which is not its Affiliate or Associate.

      (f)   MANAGEMENT FEES AND COMPENSATION. It shall not pay any management,
            consulting or similar fees to any Affiliate or to any officer,
            director or employee of it or any Affiliate except (i) payment of
            reasonable compensation and expense reimbursement

<PAGE>

                                      -71-

            to officers and employees for actual services rendered to, and
            expenses incurred for, it in the ordinary course of business, and
            (ii) payment of directors' fees and reimbursement of actual
            out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending board
            of director meetings not to exceed in the aggregate for the Obligors
            with respect to all such items $150,000 in any Fiscal Year provided
            that no such payment shall be made if a Default or an Event of
            Default is outstanding or if the making of such payment will result
            in a Default or an Event of Default.

      (g)   CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. It shall not create, incur, assume or suffer
            to exist any Contingent Obligations, other than in respect of the
            Obligations except: (i) endorsements for collection or deposit in
            the ordinary course of business; (ii) Contingent Obligations
            incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect to surety
            and appeal bonds, performance bonds and other similar obligations;
            and (iii) Contingent Obligations arising with respect to customary
            indemnification obligations in favour of purchasers in connection
            with dispositions permitted under Section 9.2(b). The foregoing
            permission to incur Contingent Obligations is not consent for any
            Obligor to honour those Contingent Obligations if otherwise
            restricted or prohibited by this Agreement.

      (h)   RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. It shall not (i) declare or make any payment or
            other distribution of assets, properties, cash, rights, obligations
            or securities on account of any of its capital stock, partnership
            interests, membership interests or other equity securities (except
            that any Obligor may declare and pay dividends to another Obligor
            (so long as it remains an Obligor)), or (ii) purchase, redeem or
            otherwise acquire for value any of its, or any of its Affiliates',
            shares of capital stock, partnership interests, membership interests
            or other equity securities or any warrants, rights or options to
            acquire such interests or securities now or hereafter outstanding.

      (i)   CHANGE IN BUSINESS. It shall not engage in any material line of
            business substantially different from those lines of business
            carried on by it on the date hereof and it shall not change the
            location from which such line of business is carried on by it, all
            as described in Schedule C.

      (j)   CHANGE IN STRUCTURE. It shall not make any changes in its equity
            capital structure (including a change in the terms of its
            outstanding equity securities), or amend its constating documents
            (including any shareholder agreement), except as necessary to effect
            transactions permitted under Section 9.2(c).

      (k)   ACCOUNTING CHANGES. It shall not make any significant change in
            accounting treatment or reporting practices, except as required by
            GAAP, or change its Fiscal Year.

      (l)   MATERIAL CONTRACTS. It shall not (i) cancel or terminate any
            Material Contract; (ii) waive any default or breach under any
            Material Contract; (iii) amend or otherwise modify any Material

            Material Contract, that would, in each case, have a Material Adverse
            Effect.

      (m)   LIMITATION ON SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. Unless in compliance
            with Section 5.2 hereof, it will not, directly or indirectly, enter
            into any sale and leaseback

<PAGE>

                                      -72-

            transaction with respect to any property or assets (whether now
            owned or hereafter acquired).

      (n)   LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. It will not, without the prior written
            approval of the Agent and the Lenders, other than in respect of the
            proceeds of the Advance under Facility C and the corresponding
            equity contribution in each of the ULC and the LLC and the
            subsequent loan to Sunrich Food Group and/or Opta, as applicable,
            (i) purchase or acquire, or make any commitment to purchase or
            acquire, any capital stock, equity interest, or any obligations or
            other securities of, or any interest in, any Person, including,
            without limitation, the establishment or creation of a Subsidiary,
            or (ii) make or commit to make any acquisition of all or
            substantially all of the assets of another Person, or of any
            business or division of any Person, including without limitation, by
            way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or
            (iii) make or commit to make any advance, loan, extension of credit
            or capital contribution to or any other investment in, any Person
            including any Affiliate or make any payments in respect thereof (the
            items described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are referred to as
            "INVESTMENTS"), except for: (A) Investments in cash and Cash
            Equivalents; (B) extensions of credit by one Obligor to another
            Obligor (so long as it remains an Obligor), as the case may be and
            interest and other payments made in connection with such extensions
            of credit; and (C) extensions of credit which constitute trade
            receivables in the ordinary course of business.

      (o)   USE OF CASH. Use any cash on deposit with BMO, Harris or the Agent

            covenant contained in this Agreement or any other Document.

      (p)   LOANS TO 1108176 ONTARIO. It will not make loans or advance funds or
            make or increase, as the case may be, any equity investment in
            1108176 Ontario.

      (q)   CLARIDGE DEBENTURE. It will not, without the prior written approval
            of the Agent and the Unanimous Lenders, repay the Claridge Debenture
            prior to the maturity date thereof unless the Consolidated Borrower
            meets, to the satisfaction of the Unanimous Lenders, the December
            31, 2003 year end financial projections provided to the Agent and
            the Lenders in connection with this Agreement.

      (r)   LOCATION OF ASSETS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. It will not, except for
            any property being delivered to a customer in the ordinary course of
            business of such Obligor as part of the performance of its
            obligations, or the provision of its services, to such customer
            under a contract entered into with such customer in the ordinary
            course of business of such Obligor, acquire any property outside of
            the jurisdictions identified in Schedule I or move any property from
            one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction where the movement of such
            property would cause the Security over such property to cease to be
            perfected under Applicable Law, or knowingly suffer or permit in any
            other manner any of its property to not be subject to the Security
            or to be or become located in a jurisdiction as a result of which
            the Security over such property is not perfected, unless (x) the
            Obligor has first given 30 days prior written notice thereof to the
            Agent or the US Security Agent, as applicable, and (y) the
            applicable Obligor has first executed and delivered to the Agent or
            the US Security Agent, as applicable, all Security Documents and all
            financing or registration statements in form and

<PAGE>

                                      -73-

            substance satisfactory to the Agent or the US Security Agent, as
            applicable, which the Agent or the US Security Agent, as applicable,
            or its counsel, acting reasonably, from time to time deem necessary
            or advisable to ensure that the Security Documents at all times
            constitute a perfected first priority Lien (subject only to
            Permitted Liens) over such property notwithstanding the movement or
            location of such property as aforesaid together with such supporting
            certificates, resolutions, opinions and other documents as the Agent
            or the US Security Agent, as applicable, may deem necessary or
            desirable in connection with such security and registrations.

9.3   FINANCIAL COVENANTS OF THE BORROWERS.

While any amount owing under this Agreement or any of the other Documents
remains unpaid, or the Agent or the Lenders have any obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Documents, the Borrowers covenant with the Agent
and each Lender as follows:

      (a)   FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO. The Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio of the
            Consolidated Borrower shall at all times prior to December 31, 2003
            be less than 3.00 : 1.00, shall at all times from December 31, 2003
            to December 31, 2004 be less than 2.75 : 1.00 and shall at all times
            thereafter be less than 2.50 : 1.00.

      (b)   FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
            Consolidated Borrower shall at all times up to and including June
            30, 2003 be greater than or equal to 1.25 : 1.00 and thereafter
            shall at all times be greater than or equal to 1.5 : 1.00.

      (c)   DEBT TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH RATIO. The Debt to Tangible Net Worth
            Ratio of the Consolidated Borrower shall at all times be less than
            2.5: 1.00.

      (d)   WORKING CAPITAL RATIO. The Working Capital Ratio of the Consolidated
            Borrower shall not at any time be less than 1.25 : 1.00, increasing
            to 1.50 : 1.00 by December 31, 2003 and at all times thereafter.

      (e)   TANGIBLE NET WORTH. The Consolidated Borrower shall maintain a
            Tangible Net Worth of not less than US$25,000,000 at all times plus
            75% of cumulative positive net income plus the stated capital amount
            of any share or other equity issuance.

      (f)   CALCULATION OF RATIOS, ETC. The Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio, the
            Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio
            shall each be calculated quarterly on any day based on the most
            recent period of twelve fiscal months completed and ending on or
            immediately prior to such day. For greater certainty in connection
            with the calculation of various financial ratios for purposes of
            this Agreement, the EBIDTA for Opta for the first Fiscal Quarter of
            2002 is US$792,000, for the second Fiscal Quarter of 2002 is
            US$1,121,000, for the third Fiscal Quarter of 2002 is US$895,000 and
            for the fourth Fiscal Quarter of 2002 is US$300,000.

      (g)   CHANGES TO GAAP. Upon the occurrence of any change in GAAP, the
            Majority Lenders will adjust the ratios set out in this Section 9.3.

9.4   ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION.

While any amount owing under this Agreement or any of the other Documents
remains unpaid, or the Agent or the Lenders have any obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Documents, each Borrower covenants with the Agent
and the Lenders as follows:

      (a)   QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Within 60 days of the
            end of each Fiscal Quarter, it will deliver to the Agent the
            unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Stake as at the end of such
            Fiscal Quarter and the related unaudited consolidated statements of
            income and cash flows, together with schedules prepared in a form
            satisfactory to BMO, Harris and the Facility C Majority Lenders,
            presenting the balance sheet of the Obligors as at the end of such
            Fiscal Quarter and the related consolidating spreadsheets (including
            balance sheets and income statements) in respect of each Obligor of
            income and cash flows, (and showing all adjustments made to prepare
            such balance sheet and statement) all of which shall be certified by
            the Chief Financial Officer of Stake (or an acceptable designate),
            together with a certificate of such officer relating to the
            compliance or non-compliance with this Agreement in the form
            attached hereto as Schedule T and attaching a true copy of the
            quarterly report of management to the board of directors of Stake,
            such quarterly report of management to be in a form similar to the
            "Q3 2002 Board of Directors Report" previously delivered to the
            Lenders (a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule X). For
            greater certainty and with reference to the phrase "subject in the
            case of interim financial statements to normal year-end adjustments"
            contained in clause (a) of Schedule T, if any "normal year-end

10.2  RIGHTS UPON DEFAULT AND EVENT OF DEFAULT.

Upon the occurrence of a Default, Harris in respect of Facility B and the Agent
in respect of Facility C may, and the Agent shall upon the instructions of the
Facility C Majority Lenders, on notice to the Borrower, declare that the ability
of the Borrower to require any further Advances under Facility B or Facility C
shall be suspended pending the remedying of the Default. Upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 10.1(i) or 10.1(j), Harris in respect
of Facility B and the Agent in respect of Facility C shall, and upon the
occurrence of any other Event of Default and for so long as the other Event of
Default shall continue, Harris in respect of Facility B and the Agent in respect
of Facility C may, and the Agent shall upon the instructions of the Facility C
Majority Lenders, without notice to the Borrower, do either or both of the
following:

      (a)   declare that Harris' commitment under Facility B and the Total
            Facility C Commitment under Facility C has expired and that the
            Lender's obligations to make Advances under Facility B and Facility
            C have terminated; and

      (b)   declare the entire principal amount of all Advances, outstanding
            under Facility B and Facility C, all unpaid accrued interest and all
            fees and other amounts required to be paid hereunder in connection
            with Facility B and Facility C to be immediately due and payable
            without the necessity of presentment for payment, notice of
            non-payment and of protest (all of which are hereby expressly
            waived) and proceed to exercise any and all rights and remedies
            hereunder and under any other Document.

With respect to Facility A, upon demand for payment or occurrence of a Default,
BMO may, on notice to the Facility A Borrower, declare the ability of the
Facility A Borrower to make request for further Advances suspended pending the
remedying of the Default. Upon the occurrence of an

<PAGE>

                                      -80-

Event of Default BMO may, in respect of Facility A (and without prejudice to the
ability of BMO to make a demand for payment at any time and from time to time
under Facility A), make the same type of declarations that are contemplated in
clauses (a) and (b) above with respect to Facility B and Facility C. From and
after the issuance of any declaration referred to in this Section 10.2, no
Lender shall be required to honour any cheque or other instrument presented to
it by any Borrower regardless of the date of issue or presentation. Immediately
upon receipt of a declaration under Section 10.2(b), the Borrowers shall pay to
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in respect of Facility C, to Harris in
respect of Facility B or to BMO in respect of Facility A, as applicable, all
amounts outstanding hereunder including, if applicable, the Hedge Contract
Exposure owing under each Hedge Contract with a Lender under Facility C. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Facility A Borrower shall pay BMO
the principal amount of all Bankers' Acceptances which have not matured and the
principal amount payable under all outstanding Letters of Credit, which are
unmatured or unexpired, which amounts shall be held by BMO as collateral
security for the Facility A Borrower's obligations with respect to those
Bankers' Acceptances and Letters of Credit, as applicable. In addition, Sunrich
Food Group shall pay Harris the principal amount payable under all outstanding
Letters of Credit, which are unmatured or unexpired, which amounts shall be held
by Harris as collateral security for the Borrower's obligation under Facility B
with respect to those Letters of Credit. The Hedge Contract Exposure under any
Hedge Contract shall be determined in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement.

10.3  WAIVER OF DEFAULT.

No express or implied waiver by the Agent and the Lenders of any demand, Default
or Event of Default shall in any way be or be construed to be a waiver of any
future or subsequent Default or Event of Default. For greater certainty, a
Default or Event of Default declared by the Agent or any Lender may only be
waived by the Unanimous Lenders. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
Obligors hereby waive any rights now or thereafter conferred by statute or
otherwise which may limit or modify any of the Agent's, the Lenders' or the US
Security Agent's rights or remedies under any Document. The Obligors acknowledge
and agree that the exercise by the Agent, the US Security Agent or any Lender of
any rights or remedies under any Document without having declared an
acceleration shall not in any way alter, affect or prejudice the right of the
Agent or any Lender to make a declaration pursuant to Section 10.2 at any time
and, without limiting the foregoing, shall not be construed as or deemed to
constitute a waiver of any rights under Section 10.2.

                                   SECTION 11
                                    REMEDIES

11.1  REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

For greater certainty, the rights and remedies of the Agent, the US Security
Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Documents are
cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for any rights or
remedies provided by law. Any single or partial exercise by the Agent, the US
Security Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy upon the occurrence of a
demand, Default or Event of Default shall not be deemed to be a waiver of, or to
alter, affect or prejudice any other right or remedy to which the Agent, the US
Security Agent or any Lender may be lawfully entitled as a result of the demand,
Default or Event of Default, and any waiver by the Agent, the US Security Agent
or any Lender of the strict observance of, performance of or compliance with any
term, covenant, condition or agreement herein contained, and any indulgence
granted thereby, shall

<PAGE>

                                      -81-

be deemed not to be a waiver of any subsequent demand, Default or Event of
Default or of the right of BMO to demand payment under Facility A at any time
and from time to time.

11.2  REMEDIES NOT LIMITED.

The Agent, BMO, Harris or the US Security Agent, as applicable, on behalf of
itself and the Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, bring
suit at law, in equity or otherwise, for any available relief or purpose
including, but not limited to: (a) the specific performance of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or in any other Document; (b) an
injunction against a violation of any of the terms of this Agreement or any
other Document; (c) in aid of the exercise of any power granted by this
Agreement or any other Document or by law; or (d) the recovery of any judgment
for any and all amounts due in respect of the Obligations.

11.3  SET-OFF, ETC.

Upon the occurrence of demand, Default or Event of Default, the Agent, the US
Security Agent and each Lender and each of their respective branches and offices
are hereby authorized by each Obligor from time to time, without notice to: (a)
set off and apply any and all amounts owing by the Agent, the US Security Agent
or any Lender or any of its branches or offices to any Obligor (whether payable
in Canadian Dollars or any other currency and any amounts so owing in any other
currency may be converted into one or more currencies in which the Obligations
are denominated at such rate or rates as the party may be able to obtain, acting
reasonably - whether matured or unmatured, and in the case of deposits, whether
general or special, time or demand and however evidenced) against and on account
of the Obligations (whether or not any declaration under Section 10.2 has been
made and whether or not those Obligations are unmatured or contingent); (b) hold
any amounts owing by the Agent, the US Security Agent or any Lender as
collateral to secure payment of the Obligations owing to it to the extent that
those amounts may be required to satisfy any contingent or unmatured Obligations
owing to it; and (c) return as unpaid for insufficient funds any and all cheques
and other items drawn against any deposits so held as the Agent, the US Security
Agent or any Lender in its sole discretion may elect. For greater certainty, and
in addition to the rights, powers and remedies set out above, the Agent, the US
Security Agent, each Lender and each of their respective branches and offices,
may exercise at their discretion any and all set-off and other rights and
remedies afforded to each of them pursuant to Applicable Law. The amount of any
set-off exercised by the Agent, the US Security Agent or a Lender shall be
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Security Sharing Agreement.

11.4  AGENT OR LENDER MAY PERFORM COVENANTS.

If any Obligor fails to perform any of its obligations under any covenant
contained in this Agreement or any other Document, the Agent, the US Security
Agent or any Lender may (but has no obligation to), upon notice to the
Borrowers, perform any covenant capable of being performed by it and, if the
covenant requires the payment or expenditure of money, it may make an Advance to
fund that requirement, which Advance shall be repaid by the Borrowers on demand.
That Advance shall bear interest at a rate calculated and paid in accordance
with Section 4.

                                      -82-

                                   SECTION 12
                            THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

12.1  ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADVANCES.

The Agent shall give notice to each Lender under Facility C promptly in writing
upon receipt by the Agent of any notice given under this Agreement which affects
such a Lender. The Agent shall advise each Lender of the amount, date and
details of each Advance and of each Lender's participation in each Advance. At
or before 1:00 p.m. on the Drawdown Date, each Lender will make its
participation available to the Borrower at the Agent's Account for Payments.
Unless the Agent has actual knowledge that a Lender under Facility C has not
made or will not make available to the Agent for value on the Drawdown Date
requested for an Advance by the Borrower under Facility C such Lender's Rateable
Portion of such Advance requested, the Agent shall be entitled to assume that
such amount has been or will be received from such Lender when so due and the
Agent may (but shall not be obliged to), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not in fact
received by the Agent from such Lender on such Drawdown Date and the Agent has
made available a corresponding amount to the Borrower on such Drawdown Date as
aforesaid, such Lender shall pay to the Agent on demand an amount equal to the
product of (i) the interest rate per annum applicable to the Advance multiplied
by (ii) the amount that should have been paid to the Agent by such Lender on
such Drawdown Date and was not, multiplied by (iii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days that have elapsed from and including such Drawdown
Date to but excluding the date on which the amount is received by the Agent from
such Lender and the denominator of which is 365. A certificate of the Agent
containing details of the amount owing by a Lender under this Section shall be
deemed to be prima facie correct. If any such amount is not in fact received by
the Agent from such Lender on such Drawdown Date, the Agent shall be entitled to
recover from the Borrower, on demand, the related amount made available by the
Agent to the Borrower as aforesaid together with interest thereon at the
applicable rate per annum payable by the Borrower hereunder (but for greater
certainty, without prejudice to any claim which the Borrower might have against
such Lender as a result of such Lender not having made its Rateable Portion of
such Advance).

12.2  PAYMENTS BY AGENT

      (a)   The following provisions shall apply to any and all payments made or
            to be made by the Agent to the Lenders under Facility C hereunder:

            (i)   the Agent shall be under no obligation to make any payment
                  (whether in respect of principal, interest, fees or otherwise)
                  to any Lender until an amount in respect of such payment has
                  been received by the Agent from the Borrower;

            (ii)  if the Agent receives a payment of principal, interest, fees
                  or other amount owing by the Borrower under Facility C which
                  is less than the full amount of any such payment due, the
                  Agent shall have no obligation to remit to each Lender any
                  amount other than such Lender's Rateable Portion of the amount
                  actually received by the Agent;

            (iii) if any Lender has advanced more or less than its Rateable
                  Portion of its Facility C Commitment, such Lender's
                  entitlement to such payment shall be

<PAGE>

                                      -83-

                  increased or reduced, as the case may be, in proportion to
                  the amount actually advanced by such Lender;

            (iv)  if a Lender's Rateable Portion of an Advance under Facility C
                  has been advanced for less than the full period to which any
                  payment by the Borrower relates, such Lender's entitlement to
                  receive a portion of any payment of interest or fees shall be
                  reduced in proportion to the length of time such Lender's
                  Rateable Portion has actually been outstanding (unless such
                  Lender has paid all interest required to have been paid by it
                  to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.1);

            (v)   the Agent acting reasonably and in good faith shall, after
                  consultation with the Lenders under Facility C in the case of
                  any dispute, determine in all cases the amount of all payments
                  to which each Lender under Facility C is entitled and such
                  determination shall be deemed to be prima facie correct;

            (vi)  upon request, the Agent shall deliver a statement detailing
                  any of the payments to the Lenders under Facility C referred
                  to herein;

            (vii) all payments by the Agent to a Lender hereunder shall be made
                  to such Lender at its address set out herein unless notice to
                  the contrary is received by the Agent from such Lender; and

            (viii) if the Agent has received a payment from the Borrower on a
                  Business Day (not later than the time required for the receipt
                  of such payment as set out in this Agreement) and fails to
                  remit such payment to any Lender entitled to receive its
                  Rateable Portion of such payment on such Business Day, the
                  Agent agrees to pay interest on such late payment at the same
                  rate and in the same manner as set out in section 12.1.

      (b)   Unless the Agent has actual knowledge that the Borrower has not made
            or will not make a payment to the Agent in respect of Facility C for
            value on the date in respect of which the Borrower has notified the
            Agent in writing that the payment will be made, the Agent shall be
            entitled to assume that such payment has been or will be received
            from the Borrower when due and the Agent may (but shall not be
            obliged to), in reliance upon such assumption, pay to each Lender
            its Rateable Portion of the payment expected from the Borrower. If
            the Agent has made such payments to the Lenders and the expected
            payment from the Borrower is in fact not received by the Agent on
            the required date, then each Lender which has received any such
            payment agrees to refund such payment to the Agent immediately upon
            request, and the Borrower shall, without limiting its other
            obligations under this Agreement, indemnify the Agent against any
            and all liabilities, obligations, losses (other than loss of
            profit), damages, penalties, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
            kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on or incurred by the
            Agent as a result of having made such payments to the Lenders,
            except for those arising from the Agent's negligence or wilful
            misconduct. A certificate of the Agent with respect to any amount
            owing by the Borrower under this section shall be deemed to be prima
            facie correct.

<PAGE>

                                      -84-

      (c)   The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to debit any
            account maintained by the Borrower with the Agent in order to make
            payments to the Lenders under Facility C as contemplated herein. The
            Agent agrees to provide written notice to the Borrower of each such
            debit in reasonable detail. The Borrower shall be deemed to have
            agreed to each such debit unless the Borrower objects in writing to
            such debit within 30 days after receipt of such written notice from
            the Agent.

            reducing the amortization period contemplated by the Scheduled
            Payments in respect of Facility C; (x) the removal, in respect of
            Facility A, of the requirement that Advances not exceed the Facility
            A Borrowing Base as set out in Section 3.2(a) or an increase in the
            frequency that a Borrowing Base Certificate is required to be
            delivered under Section 3.6(a); (xi) the removal, in respect of

      (b)   Except for the matters described in paragraph (a) above, any
            amendment, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this
            Agreement relating to the following matter shall be effective only

            (i) any change to the financial covenant requirements set out in
            Section 9.3 which would make such financial covenants more
            restrictive.

      (c)   Except for the matters described in paragraph (a) and (b) above, any
            amendment, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this

<PAGE>

                                      -85-

            margin set out in the Facility A and B Pricing Grid can only be
            amended with the consent of the parties set forth in (i) and (ii)
            above, provided, however, that any material increase in the
            applicable interest and fee margin requires the prior approval of
            the Unanimous Lenders, and (B) any amendment of the covenants
            contained in Section 9 shall be deemed to relate to each Facility.
            Each of BMO and Harris agrees to provide a copy of any such
            amendment to the Agent and the other Lenders promptly after the
            execution thereof. Any actions to be taken or decisions to be made
            by BMO relating to Facility A or by Harris relating to Facility B
            shall be made, respectively, by BMO and Harris. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, however, neither BMO nor Harris will enter into any
            amendment to this Agreement relating to Facility A or Facility B
            which increases the aggregate principal amount of credit available
            under such Credit Facilities without the prior written consent of
            the Unanimous Lenders.

      (d)   Except for the matters described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
            above, any amendment, waiver, discharge or termination with respect
            to this Agreement relating to the following matters under or in
            respect of Facility C shall be effective only if agreed between the
            Borrower and all of the Lenders under Facility C acting unanimously
            (such amendment, waiver, discharge or termination, as applicable,
            having been approved by all of the Lenders under Facility C pursuant
            to Section 12.8(j)):

            (i)   the rate or amount of any principal, interest or fees or any
                  other amount payable by the Borrower or any alteration in the
                  currency or mode of calculation or computation thereof;

            (ii)  any extension of the time for any payments required to be made
                  by the Borrower;

            (iv)  an increase in any Lender's respective Commitment;

            (v)   an extension or reduction of the notice period required in
                  connection with any Advance;

            (vi)  the definition of "Facility C Majority Lenders";

            (vii) an assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights

            Lenders acting unanimously: (i) any change in the nature and scope
            of the Security or any release of the Security or any portion
            thereof, except that the Agent or the US Security Agent, as
            applicable, may from time to time without notice to or the consent
            of the Lenders execute and deliver partial releases of the Security
            from time to time in respect of any item of Collateral to the extent

<PAGE>

                                      -86-

            expressly permitted in this Agreement, whether or not the Borrower
            may have an obligation to apply the net proceeds thereof as a
            repayment hereunder.

      (f)   Except for the matters described in paragraphs (d) and (e) above,
            any action to be taken or decision to be made exclusively by the
            Lenders under Facility C pursuant to the Agreement shall be
            effective if approved by the Facility C Majority Lenders pursuant to
            Section 12.8(j); and any such decision or action shall be final and
            binding upon all of the Lenders under Facility C.

12.4  SECURITY HELD BY AGENT AND US SECURITY AGENT

Except to the extent provided in Section 12.5, the Security shall be granted in
favour of and held by the Agent or the US Security Agent for and on behalf of
the Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Security
Sharing Agreement. The Agent or the US Security Agent shall, in accordance with
its usual practices in effect from time to time, take all steps required to
perfect and maintain such Security, including: taking possession of the share
certificates representing the shares required to be pledged hereunder; filing
renewals and change notices in respect of such Security; and ensuring that the
name of the Agent or the US Security Agent is noted as loss payee or mortgagee
on all property insurance policies covering assets subject to the Security. If
the Agent or the US Security Agent becomes aware of any matter concerning the
Security which it considers to be material, it shall promptly inform the
Lenders. The Agent and the US Security Agent agree to permit each Lender to
review and make photocopies of the original documents comprising the Security
from time to time upon reasonable notice. Each of the Lenders acknowledges that
to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Security and the remedies
provided under the Documents to the Lenders are for the benefit of the Lenders
collectively and acting together and not severally, and further acknowledges
that its rights hereunder and under the Security are to be exercised not
severally, but by the Agent or the US Security Agent in accordance with the
Security Sharing Agreement. Accordingly, notwithstanding any of the provisions
contained herein or in the Security each Lender covenants and agrees that it
shall not be entitled to take any action hereunder or thereunder including,
without limitation, any declaration of default hereunder or thereunder but that
any such action shall be taken only by the Agent or the US Security Agent in
accordance with the Security Sharing Agreement.

12.5  PRIORITIES OF SECURITY

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the proceeds of
realization of the Security or any portion thereof shall be distributed in
accordance with the provisions of the Security Sharing Agreement.

12.6  APPOINTMENT OF AGENT

Subject to Section 12.10, each Lender under Facility C hereby irrevocably
appoints the Agent to act as its agent in connection with this Agreement, and
irrevocably authorizes the Agent to exercise such rights, powers and discretions
as are delegated to it pursuant to this Agreement together with all such rights,
powers and discretions as are incidental hereto or thereto. The Agent hereby
accepts such appointment and agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement for so long as it is an Agent hereunder. The Agent shall have only
those duties and responsibilities which are expressly specified in this
Agreement, and it may perform such duties by or through its agent or employees.
It is expressly agreed that the Agent is not a fiduciary of any Lender nor shall
it owe any fiduciary duties to any Lender. Any Person to whom the Agent may
delegate duties or responsibilities as

<PAGE>

                                      -87-


permitted hereunder shall enjoy and be bound by the same benefits, rights,
protections and obligations as those provided to the Agent or to which the Agent
is subject under this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

12.7  PROTECTION OF AGENT

      (a)   Unless and until instructed by the Facility C Majority Lenders, the
            Agent shall not be bound to inquire as to: (i) whether any
            representation made by the Borrower in or in connection with any
            Document is true; (ii) the occurrence or otherwise of any Event of
            Default or Default; (iii) the performance by the Borrower of its
            obligations under any Document; (iv) any breach of or default by the
            Borrower or any Obligor under its obligations under any Document; or
            (v) the use or application by the Borrower of any of the proceeds of
            an Advance under Facility C. The Agent shall report the results of
            any such enquiry to the Lenders under Facility C, but shall have no
            obligation to take any action in connection therewith unless
            otherwise instructed by the Facility C Majority Lenders as provided
            herein.

      (b)   Unless the Agent has actual knowledge or actual notice to the
            contrary, it may assume that: (i) any representation made by any
            Obligor in or in connection with any Document is true; (ii) no Event
            of Default or Default has occurred; and (iii) the Borrower is not in
            breach of or in default under, its obligations under any Document.

      (c)   Unless the Agent has actual knowledge or actual notice to the
            contrary, it may assume that each Lender's address is that set out
            herein until it has received from such Lender a notice designating
            some other office of such Lender as its address and act upon any
            such notice until the same is superseded by a further such notice.

      (d)   The Agent may engage and pay for the advice or services of any
            lawyers, accountants or other experts whose advice or services may
            to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable and rely upon any
            advice so obtained.

      (e)   Unless the Agent has actual knowledge or actual notice to the
            contrary, the Agent may rely as to matters of fact which might
            reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of any Obligor
            upon a statement contained in any Document.

      (f)   Unless the Agent has actual knowledge or actual notice to the
            contrary, the Agent may rely upon any communication or document
            believed by it to be genuine.

      (g)   The Agent may refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
            vested in it under this Agreement unless and until instructed by, as
            applicable, the Majority Lenders, the Facility C Majority Lenders or
            the Unanimous Lenders as to whether or not such right, power or
            discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be exercised, as to
            the manner in which it should be exercised.

      (h)   The Agent may refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
            vested in it which would or might in its opinion in its sole
            discretion be contrary to any law of any jurisdiction or any
            directive or otherwise render it liable to any Person, and may do
            anything which is in its opinion in its sole discretion necessary to
            comply with any such law or directive.

<PAGE>

                                      -88-

      (i)   The Agent may delegate to such other Person, such duties and
            responsibilities of the Agent hereunder as it shall determine to be
            appropriate in respect of dealings with or relating to the Borrower
            or any other Person.

      (j)   The Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any
            instructions of the Majority Lenders, the Facility C Majority
            Lenders or the Unanimous Lenders to begin any legal action or
            proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
            take any steps to enforce or realize upon any Security, until it
            shall have received such security as it may reasonably require
            (whether by way of payment in advance or otherwise) against all
            costs, claims, expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities which
            it will or may expend or incur in complying with such instruction.

      (k)   The Agent shall not be bound to disclose to any Person any
            information relating to the Borrower or any Obligor if such
            disclosure would or might in its opinion in its sole discretion
            constitute a breach of any law or regulation or be otherwise
            actionable at the suit of any Person.

      (l)   The Agent shall not accept any responsibility for the accuracy
            and/or completeness of any information supplied in connection
            herewith or for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
            enforceability of any Document and the Agent shall not be under any
            liability to any Lender as a result of taking or omitting to take
            any action in relation to any Document save in the case of the
            Agent's negligence or wilful misconduct.

12.8  DUTIES OF AGENT

The Agent shall in respect of Facility C:

      (a)   provide to each Lender under Facility C copies (including, if
            available, electronic copies) of all financial information received
            from the Borrower promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of any
            notices in respect of a Drawdown, Conversion, Rollover, and other
            notices received by the Agent from the Borrower upon request by any
            Lender;

      (b)   promptly advise each Lender under Facility C of Advances required to
            be made by it hereunder and disburse all repayments to the Lenders
            under Facility C in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

      (c)   promptly notify each Lender under Facility C of the occurrence of
            any Event of Default or any Default by the Borrower in the due
            performance of its obligations under this Agreement or the Security
            and of which the Agent has actual knowledge or actual notice;

      (d)   each time the Borrower requests the prior written consent of the
            Facility C Majority Lenders, use its best efforts to obtain and
            communicate to the Borrower the response of the Facility C Majority
            Lenders in a reasonably prompt and timely manner having due regard
            to the nature and circumstances of the request;

<PAGE>

                                      -89-

      (e)   give written notice to the Borrower in respect of any other matter
            in respect of which notice is required in accordance with or
            pursuant to this Agreement, promptly or promptly after receiving the
            consent of the Majority Lenders, the Facility C Majority Lenders or
            the Unanimous Lenders, if required under the terms of this
            Agreement;

      (f)   except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, act in accordance
            with any instructions given to it, as applicable, by the Majority
            Lenders, the Facility C Majority Lenders or the Unanimous Lenders,
            applicable;

      (g)   at the time of engaging any agent, receiver, receiver-manager,
            consultant, monitor or other party in connection with the Security
            or the enforcement thereof, obtain the agreement of such party to
            comply with the applicable terms of this Agreement and the Security
            Sharing Agreement in carrying out any such enforcement activities
            and dealing with any proceeds of realization;

      (h)   if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, the Facility C Majority
            Lenders or the Unanimous Lenders, as applicable, refrain from
            exercising any right, power or discretion vested in it under this
            Agreement or any Document incidental hereto;

      (i)   account for any monies received by it in connection with this
            Agreement, the Security and any other agreement delivered in
            connection herewith or therewith; and

      (j)   call a meeting of the Lenders under Facility C at any time not
            earlier than five (5) days and not later than thirty (30) days after
            receipt of a written request for a meeting provided by any Lender
            under Facility C; provided that the above notice requirements may be
            waived by the unanimous agreement of the Lenders under Facility C;
            and provided further that any instrument executed by all of the
            Lenders under Facility C (which may be in counterparts) shall have
            the same effect as if passed by the Lenders under Facility C at a
            duly called meeting.

12.9  INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT

Each Lender under Facility C shall on demand by the Agent indemnify the Agent in
accordance with each such Lender's Rateable Portion of Facility C, against any
and all costs, claims, reasonable expenses (including legal fees) and
liabilities which the Agent may incur (and which have not been reimbursed by the
Borrower) to the extent required hereunder, otherwise than by reason of its own
negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its capacity as the Agent under
this Agreement, the Security or any other Document.

12.10 TERMINATION OR RESIGNATION OF AGENT

The Facility C Majority Lenders may terminate the Agent's appointment hereunder
upon giving the Agent 90 days' prior written notice to such effect. The Agent
may resign its appointment hereunder at any time upon giving 90 days' prior
written notice to each Lender under Facility C, without giving any reason
therefor. In the event of any such termination or resignation, the Facility C
Majority Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent acceptable to the Borrower
(whose consent may not be unreasonably withheld). Within a reasonable time after
the appointment of the successor Agent, the retiring Agent shall assign the
Security to the successor Agent. Upon such assignment the retiring Agent shall
be discharged from any further obligation hereunder but shall remain entitled to
the benefit of the provisions of this Section 12; and the Agent's successor and
each of the

<PAGE>

                                      -90-

other parties hereto shall have the same rights and obligations among themselves
as they would have had if such successor originally had been a party hereto as
the Agent. If a Person ceases to be the Agent and a successor Agent is not
appointed within such 90 day period, upon the expiry of such period such Person
shall receive no further compensation for acting as Agent and shall be released
from all obligations as Agent except that until a successor Agent is appointed
such Person shall passively hold the Security as Agent for the Lenders without
taking any action to preserve, renew, maintain or enforce the Security; and its
sole remaining obligation shall be to assign the Security to its successor if
and when a successor Agent is appointed.

12.11 RIGHTS OF AGENT AS A LENDER

The Agent in its capacity as a Lender under Facility C shall have the same
rights and powers under the Documents as any other Lender under Facility C, and
it may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not performing the
duties and functions delegated to it as the Agent hereunder. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Agent in its capacity as a Lender under
Facility C may retain for its own benefit any fee or other sum receivable by it
for its own account, and may accept deposits from, lend money to, provide any
advisory or other services to or engage in any kind of banking or other business
with any Obligor.

12.12 FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The Agent shall have no duty or responsibility either initially or on a
continuing basis to provide any Lender under Facility C with any credit or other
information with respect to the financial condition and affairs of any Obligor,
except to the extent expressly set out herein.

12.13 LENDERS' INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION

Each of the Lenders under Facility C represents and warrants to the Agent and
BMO that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial
condition and affairs of the Obligors in connection with the establishment of
credit for the Borrower under Facility C, and that it has not relied on any
information provided to it by the Agent or BMO in connection therewith, and each
represents and warrants to the Agent that it shall continue to make its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Obligor from time to time.

12.14 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BY AGENT

The Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal proceedings against the
Borrower or any other Person for the recovery of any amount due under this
Agreement or the Security, unless instructed to do so by, as applicable, the
Majority Lenders, the Facility C Majority Lenders or the Unanimous Lenders. No
Lender shall bring legal proceedings against the Borrower or any other Person
hereunder under any Security or under any other Documents or in connection
herewith or therewith, or exercise any right arising hereunder or thereunder or
in connection herewith or therewith over the property and assets of the Borrower
or any other Person, without the prior written consent of the Unanimous Lenders.

12.15 LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; NO PARTNERSHIP

The obligations of each Lender under this Agreement are several. The failure of
any Lender to carry out its obligations hereunder shall not relieve the other
Lenders of any of their respective obligations hereunder. No Lender shall be
responsible for the obligations of any other Lender

<PAGE>

                                      -91-

hereunder. Neither the entering into of this Agreement nor the completion of any
transactions contemplated herein shall constitute the Lenders a partnership.

12.16 SHARING OF INFORMATION

The Agent and the Lenders may share among themselves any information they may
have from time to time concerning the Obligors whether or not such information
is confidential; but shall have no obligation to do so (except for any
obligations of the Agent to provide information as required in this Agreement).

12.17 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY BORROWER

The Borrower hereby acknowledges notice of the terms of the provisions of this
Section 12 and agrees to be bound hereby to the extent of its obligations
hereunder, and further agrees to not make any payments, take any action or omit
to take any action which would result in the non-compliance by any Lender with
its obligations hereunder.

12.18 AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 12

The Agent and the Lenders may amend any provision in this Section 12 without
prior notice to or the consent of the Borrower, and the Agent shall provide a
copy of any such amendment to the Borrower reasonably promptly thereafter;
provided however if any such amendment would adversely affect any rights,
entitlements, obligations or liabilities of the Borrower (other than in a de
minimus manner), such amendment shall not be effective until the Borrower
provides its written consent thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or arbitrarily delayed.

12.19 DELIVERIES, ETC.

As between the Obligors, the Agent and the Lenders: (a) all statements,
certificates, consents and other documents which the Agent purports to deliver
to an Obligor on behalf of the Lenders under Facility C shall be binding on each
of the Lenders under Facility C, and none of the Obligors shall be required to
ascertain or confirm the authority of the Agent in delivering such documents;
(b) all certificates, statements, notices and other documents which are
delivered by an Obligor to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been duly delivered to each of the Lenders; and (c) all payments
which are delivered by the Borrower to the Agent in accordance with this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly delivered to each of the Lenders
under Facility C.

12.20 AGENCY FEE

The Borrower agrees to pay the Agent an annual agency fee in such amount as may
be agreed in writing from time to time between the Borrower and the Agent,
payable in advance on the date of this Agreement and annually on each
anniversary date thereafter during the term of this Agreement.

12.21 ADJUSTMENTS AMONG LENDERS.

      (a)   ADJUSTMENT AFTER EXERCISE OF RIGHTS. Each Lender under Facility C
            agrees that, after the exercise of any rights pursuant to Section
            10.2, it will at any time or from time to time, upon the request of
            the Agent, as required by any other Lender, purchase portions of the
            amounts due

<PAGE>

                                      -92-

            and owing to the other Lenders and make any other adjustments which
            may be necessary or appropriate so that the amounts due and owing
            to each Lender, as adjusted under this Section 12.21, will, as
            nearly as possible, reflect each Lender's Rateable Portion
            determined as at the date of the exercise of any such rights.

      (b)   GENERAL APPLICATION. For greater certainty, the Lenders under
            Facility C acknowledge and agree that, without limiting the
            generality of the provisions of Section 12.21(a), those provisions
            will have application if and whenever any Lender shall obtain any
            payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
            right of set-off or otherwise) on account of any money owing or
            payable by a Borrower to it in excess of the amounts to which it
            would otherwise be entitled under Section 12.21(a).

      (c)   ADJUSTMENTS TO ADVANCES. Notwithstanding anything else herein
            contained, the Agent may, when determining amounts payable to or
            payable by or to be advanced by a Lender under Facility C in
            connection with Advances, which amounts are determined by or by
            reference to that Lender's Rateable Portion, make such adjustments
            to such amount as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion to
            account or adjust for any amounts advanced to the Borrower, if any,
            by way of Letter of Credit and Bankers' Acceptances.

      (d)   BORROWER AGREEMENT. The Borrower agrees to be bound by and to do all
            things necessary or appropriate to give effect to any and all
            purchases and other adjustments made by and between the Lenders
            under this Section 12.21 but shall incur no increased liabilities by
            reason thereof.

12.22 AGENT MAY DEBIT ACCOUNTS.

The Borrower authorizes and directs the Agent, in the Agent's discretion, to
debit automatically, by mechanical, electronic or manual means, any bank account
of a Borrower maintained with BMO (for so long as BMO is Agent) for all amounts
payable by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Document, including
the repayment of principal and the payment of interest, fees and all charges for
the keeping of that bank account. The Agent shall notify the Borrower as to the
particulars of those debits in the normal course.

                                   SECTION 13
                                   ASSIGNMENTS

13.1  ASSIGNMENT.

      (a)   BENEFIT AND BURDEN OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall enure to
            the benefit of and be binding on the parties hereto, their
            respective successors and any permitted Assignees.

      (b)   BORROWER. The Borrowers may not assign, delegate or transfer all or
            any part of their rights or obligations under this Agreement without
            the prior written consent of the Lenders.

<PAGE>

                                      -93-

      (c)   ASSIGNMENT.

            (i)   Any Lender (herein sometimes called an "ASSIGNING LENDER")
                  may, with the prior written consent of the Borrower (subject
                  to Section 13.1(c)(ii)) and the Agent (in respect of Facility
                  C only), which consent may not, in either case, be
                  unreasonably withheld, assign all or any part of its rights
                  to, and may have its obligations in respect of the Credit
                  Facility assumed by, one or more financial institutions or
                  other entities (each an "ASSIGNEE"); provided, however, that
                  each assignment by a Lender under Facility C must be in a
                  minimum amount of at least US$5,000,000. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, no consent shall be required in respect of any
                  assignment by an Assigning Lender to its Affiliate or another
                  Lender. An assignment shall become effective when the Borrower
                  and the Agent (in respect of Facility C only) have been
                  notified of it by the Assigning Lender and have received from
                  the Assignee an undertaking (addressed to all the parties to
                  this Agreement) to be bound by this Agreement and to perform
                  the obligations assigned to it, in substantially the form of
                  Schedule W and the Agent (in respect of Facility C only) or
                  BMO (in respect of Facility A only) or Harris (in respect of
                  Facility B only) has received from the Assignee an assignment
                  fee of Cdn$3,500 or US$3,500, as applicable depending upon the
                  nature of the currency being assigned. Any Assignee shall be
                  treated as a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, shall
                  be entitled to the full benefit hereof and shall be subject to
                  the obligations of the Assigning Lender to the same extent as
                  if it were an original party in respect of the rights or
                  obligations assigned to it, and the Assigning Lender shall be
                  released and discharged accordingly and to the same extent,
                  and such Schedules as applicable shall be amended accordingly
                  from time to time without further notice or other requirement.

            (ii)  Notwithstanding Section 13.1(c)(i), no Lender under Facility A
                  may assign all or any part of its rights to or have any of its
                  obligations assumed by any financial institution or entity
                  that is a non-resident of Canada for the purposes of the ITA,
                  unless any of the following shall have occurred: (A) the
                  failure by the Borrower to make when due, whether by
                  acceleration or otherwise, any payment of principal required
                  to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other
                  Document, (B) the failure by the Borrower to make when due,
                  whether by acceleration or otherwise, any payment of interest,
                  fees, costs or any other payment under this Agreement or any
                  other Document, or (C) the exercise of any rights pursuant to
                  Section 10.2.

            (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained,
                  where a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the
                  consent of the Borrower shall not be required with respect to
                  the assignment of all or any part of the rights of a Lender
                  hereunder.

      (d)   LIMITATION. No Lender shall be entitled to make an assignment under
            Section 13.1(c)(i) or change its Branch of Account if this would,
            immediately following the assignment, participation or change of
            Branch of Account, increase the cost of the Credit Facility to the
            Borrower, except that nothing in this Section 13.1(d) shall prohibit
            the granting of an assignment by a Schedule I Lender to a Schedule
            II

<PAGE>

                                      -94-

            Lender or a Schedule III Lender notwithstanding that the Discount
            Rate applicable to Bankers' Acceptances issued by the Schedule II
            Lender or Schedule III Lender may be higher than the Discount Rate
            applicable to Bankers' Acceptances issued by the Schedule A Lender.

      (e)   BORROWER COOPERATION. The Borrower will, at the Lenders' expense
            (exclusive of the fees of legal counsel to the Borrower), execute
            such further documents and instruments and do such further things as
            the Agent or Lenders may reasonably request for the purpose of any
            participation or assignment.

      (f)   DISCLOSURE. Each Lender may disclose to any prospective Assignee, on
            a confidential basis, such information concerning the Borrower as it
            considers appropriate without incurring any liability for any breach
            of the duty of banker-customer confidentiality but subject to
            receiving an undertaking from such prospective Assignee to receive
            and maintain such information in confidence.

                                   SECTION 14
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

14.1  AMENDMENTS.

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any
departure by a party from any provision of this Agreement will be effective
unless it is in writing, and then the amendment, modification, waiver or consent
will be effective only in the specific instance, for the specific purpose and
for the specific length of time for which it is given.

14.2  NOTICE.

      (a)   Unless otherwise specified, any notice or other communication
            required or permitted to be given to a party under this Agreement
            shall be in writing and may be delivered personally or sent by
            prepaid registered mail or by facsimile, to the address or facsimile
            number of the party set out beside its name at the foot of this
            Agreement to the attention of the Person there indicated or to such
            other address, facsimile number or other Person's attention as the
            party may have specified by notice in writing given under this
            Section. Any notice or other communication shall be deemed to have
            been given (i) if delivered personally, when received; (ii) if
            mailed, subject to Section 14.3, on the fifth Business Day following
            the date of mailing; (iii) if sent by facsimile, on the Business Day
            when the appropriate confirmation of receipt has been received if
            the confirmation of receipt has been received before 3:00 p.m. on
            that Business Day or, if the confirmation of receipt has been
            received after 3:00 p.m. on that Business Day, on the next
            succeeding Business Day; and (iv) if sent by facsimile on a day
            which is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day on
            which confirmation of receipt has been received.

      (b)   All communication with any Obligor hereunder may be directed through

            instrument which is required to be given or delivered to any Obligor
            hereunder shall be deemed to have been given to and received by such
            Obligor if given to Stake.

14.3  DISRUPTION OF POSTAL SERVICE.

If a notice has been sent by prepaid registered mail and before the fifth
Business Day after the mailing there is a discontinuance or interruption of
regular postal service so that the notice cannot reasonably be expected to be
delivered within five Business Days after the mailing, the notice will be deemed
to have been given when it is actually received.

14.4  ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY.

Each Obligor shall, and does hereby, indemnify and hold each Indemnified Person
harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses incurred or suffered by,
or asserted against, the Indemnified Person, with respect to or as a direct or
indirect result of, (a) the presence on or under, or any Release or likely
Release of any Hazardous Substance from any of the Collateral comprising real
property or any other real properties owned or used by any of the Obligors or
any Subsidiary or any of their successors and assigns; or (b) the breach of any
Applicable Laws by any mortgagor, owner, lessee or occupant of such properties.

14.5  FURTHER ASSURANCES.

The Obligors shall from time to time promptly, upon the request of BMO in
respect of Facility A, Harris in respect of Facility B or the Agent in respect
of Facility C, take or cause to take such action, and execute and deliver such
further documents as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to give effect
to the provisions and intent of this Agreement and the Documents.

14.6  JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

      (a)   If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is
            necessary to convert all or any part of the liabilities or any other
            amount due to a Lender, the Agent or the US Security Agent in
            respect of any of the Borrowers' obligations under this Agreement in
            any currency (the "ORIGINAL CURRENCY") into another currency (the
            "OTHER CURRENCY"), each Borrower, to the fullest extent that it may
            effectively do so, agrees that the rate of exchange used shall be
            that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the
            Lender, the Agent or the US Security Agent could purchase the
            Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day
            preceding that on which final judgment is paid or satisfied.

      (b)   The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due in the
            Original Currency from it to any Lender shall, notwithstanding any
            judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent
            that on the Business Day following receipt by the Lender of any sum
            adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency the Lender may, in
            accordance with its normal banking procedures, purchase the Original
            Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount of the Original
            Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
            Lender in the Original Currency, the Borrowers agree, as a separate
            obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
            Lender against such loss, and if the amount of the Original Currency
            so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Lender in the
            Original Currency, the Lender agrees to remit such excess to the
            Borrowers.

14.7  WAIVERS.

No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent,
the US Security Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege shall preclude the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

14.8  REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.

The Obligors jointly and severally agree to: (a) pay or reimburse BMO in respect
of Facility A, Harris in respect of Facility B and the Agent in respect of
Facility C, on demand, for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including legal fees) incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Documents including
any subsequent amendments of this Agreement or any other Document, and the
consummation and the administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Lender; and
(b) pay or reimburse, on demand, BMO in respect of Facility A, Harris in respect
of Facility B and the Agent in respect of Facility C and the US Security Agent
for all its costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred in connection
with the determination, preservation and enforcement of any responsibilities,
rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Documents, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of its counsel. The obligations of the
Obligors under this Section 14.8 shall survive the repayment of all Advances and
the termination of the Credit Facility.

14.9  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

Each Borrower and Obligor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of the Province of Ontario and hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such court. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it
may effectively do so, the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably consents to the
service of any and all process in such action or proceeding by the delivery of
such process to such Borrower at its address provided in accordance with Section
14.2.

14.10 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.

The Borrowers and the Obligors hereby knowingly voluntarily and intentionally
waive any rights they may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
based on, or arising out of, under, or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Document, or any course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether
oral or written) or actions of the Agent, the US Security Agent, any Lender or
any of the Borrowers or Obligors. The Borrowers and the Obligors acknowledge and
agree that they have received full and sufficient consideration for this
provision (and each other provision of each other Document to which it is a
party) and that this provision is a material inducement for the Lenders entering
into this Agreement and each other Document.
