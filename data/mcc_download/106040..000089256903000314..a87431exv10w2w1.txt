                                 FIRST AMENDMENT

                                    PREAMBLE

         1.       ADOPTION AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMENDMENT. This Amendment to
the Western Digital Corporation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") is adopted to reflect
certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 ("EGTRRA") and various other changes to the Plan. This Amendment is
intended as good faith compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA and is to be
construed in accordance with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as
otherwise provided, this Amendment shall be effective as of July 1, 2002.

         2.       SUPERSESSION OF INCONSISTENT PROVISIONS. This Amendment shall
supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those provisions are
inconsistent with the provisions of this Amendment.

         3.       DEFINED TERMS. Wherever used in this Amendment, terms
identified by initial capitalization shall have the meanings indicated in the
Plan unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context. The singular
shall include the plural, unless the context indicates otherwise. Headings are
used for convenience of reference only, and in case of conflict, the text of the
Amendment, rather than such headings, shall control.

                                    ARTICLE I

                          LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS

Years beginning after December 31, 2001.

         1.2      MAXIMUM ANNUAL ADDITION. Section 15.1 of the Plan is amended
in its entirety as follows:

                  "15.1     GENERAL RULE. Except to the extent permitted under
         Article 19 and Code Section 414(v), the total Annual Additions under
         this Plan to a Participant's Plan Accounts for any Plan Year shall not
         exceed the lesser:

                            (a)      Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000), as
                  adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(c) or

                            (b)      One hundred percent (100%) percent of the
                  Participant's total Compensation from the Employer and any
                  Affiliated Companies for the year."

                  "2.8.6.1 For any Plan Year that begins on or after July 1,
         2002 such limit shall be $200,000, as that amount is adjusted in
         accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code."

                                   ARTICLE III

                         MODIFICATION OF TOP-HEAVY RULES

         3.1      EFFECTIVE DATE. This Article shall apply for purposes of
determining whether the Plan is a top-heavy plan under Code Section 416(g) for
Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, and whether the Plan satisfies the
minimum benefits requirements of Code Section 416(c) for such years. This
Article amends Article 19 of the Plan.

         3.2      DETERMINATION OF TOP-HEAVY STATUS.

         Section 19.2.1 of the Plan is revised in its entirety as follows:

                  "19.2.1   Key Employee. Key Employee means any Employee or
         former Employee (including any deceased Employee) who, at any time
         during the Plan Year that includes the Determination Date, was an
         officer of the Employer having annual Compensation greater than One
         Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars ($130,000) (as adjusted under Code
         Section 416(i)(1) for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2002), a
         five percent (5%) owner of the Employer, or a one percent (1%) owner of
         the Employer having annual Compensation of more than One Hundred Fifty
         Thousand Dollars ($150,000). The determination of who is a Key Employee
         will be made in accordance with Code Section 416(i)(1) and the
         applicable Income Tax Regulations and other guidance of general
         applicability issued thereunder."

         Section 19.3.1 of the Plan is revised by adding the following new
         subsection 19.3.1.5 at the end thereof:

                  "19.3.1.5 Determination Of Present Values And Amounts.
         Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, this
         Section 19.3.1.5 shall apply for purposes of determining the present
         values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of
         Employees as of the Determination Date.

                            (i)      Distributions During Year Ending On The
                  Determination Date. The Account balances of an Employee as of
                  the

<PAGE>

                  Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions
                  made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan
                  aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 416(g)(2) during
                  the one (1)-year period ending on the Determination Date. The
                  preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a
                  terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would have
                  been aggregated with the Plan under Code Section
                  416(g)(2)(A)(i). In the case of a distribution made for a
                  reason other than separation from service, death, or
                  Disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting
                  "five (5)-year period" for "one (1)-year period."

                            (ii)     Employees Not Performing Services During
                  Year Ending On The Determination Date. The Accounts of any
                  individual who has not performed services for the Employer
                  during the one (1)-year period ending on the Determination
                  Date shall not be taken into account."

         3.3      MINIMUM BENEFITS. Section 19.4 of the Plan is revised by
adding the following new subsection 19.4.6 at the end thereof:

                  "19.4.6   Matching Contributions shall be taken into account
         for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution requirements of
         Code Section 416(c)(2) and the Plan. The preceding sentence shall apply
         with respect to Matching Contributions under the Plan, or, if the Plan
         provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall be met in
         another plan, such other plan. Matching Contributions that are used to
         satisfy the minimum contribution requirements shall be treated as
         Matching Contributions for purposes of the ACP Test and other
         requirements of Code Section 401(m)."

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     DIRECT ROLLOVERS OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS

         4.1      EFFECTIVE DATE. This Article shall apply to distributions made
after December 31, 2001.

         4.2      MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN.
Section 9.13.3 of the Plan is revised by adding the following at the end
thereof:

                  "For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
         9.13 of the Plan, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an
         annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan
         under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political
         subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
         political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account
         for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The definition
         of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a
         distribution to a surviving Spouse, or to a Spouse or former Spouse who
         is the Alternate Payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
         defined in Code Section 414(p)."

         4.3      MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION
TO EXCLUDE HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS. Section 9.13.3 of the Plan is revised by
adding the following at the end thereof:

                  "For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
         9.13 of the Plan, any amount that is distributed on account of hardship
         shall not be an eligible rollover distribution and the distributee may
         not elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid directly to
         an eligible retirement plan."

         4.4      MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION
TO INCLUDE AFTER-TAX EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS. Section 9.13.3 of the Plan is
revised by adding the following at the end thereof:

                  "For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
         9.13 of the Plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an
         eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
         After-Tax Contributions which are not includible in gross income.
         However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual
         retirement account or annuity described in Code Section 408(a) or (b),
         or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Code Section
         401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so
         transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
         distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of
         such distribution which is not so includible."

                                    ARTICLE V

                           ROLLOVERS FROM OTHER PLANS

         and/or direct rollovers of distributions made after December 31, 2001
         solely from a qualified plan described in Code Section 401(a),
         excluding after-tax employee contributions."

                                   ARTICLE VI

                           REPEAL OF MULTIPLE USE TEST

         Section 4.4.1.2 and Section 5.9.1.2 of the Plan are each amended by
adding the following at the end thereof:

                  "Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
         contrary, the multiple use test described in Treasury Regulation
         Section 1.401(m)-2 and Sections 4.4.1.2 and 5.9.1.2 of the Plan shall
         not apply for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001."

                             CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS

         SECTION 7.1        DEFINITION.  A new definition is added to the Plan
as follows:

                  "CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS. "Catch-up Contributions shall mean
         the Pre-Tax Contributions that are made pursuant to Section 4.10 of the
         Plan. Such Catch-up Contributions are not eligible to be matched by any
         Matching Contributions."

         SECTION 7.2        CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS.  A new Section 4.10 is added
to the Plan as follows:

                  "4.10     CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS. Effective as of September 1,
         2002, all Employees who are eligible to make Pre-Tax Contributions
         under this Plan and who have attained age fifty (50) before the close
         of the Plan Year shall be eligible to make Catch-up Contributions in
         accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, Code Section
         414(v). The Committee shall establish procedures relating to Catch-Up
         Contributions, including any Compensation deferral limits. Catch-up
         Contributions shall not be taken into account for purposes of the
         provisions of the Plan implementing the required limitations of Code
         Sections 402(g) and 415. The Plan shall not be treated as failing to
         satisfy the provisions of the Plan implementing the requirements of
         Code Section 401(a)(4), 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 410(b) or
         416, as applicable, by reason of the making of such Catch-up
         Contributions. Catch-up Contributions shall not be eligible for any
         Matching Contributions under the Plan. Pre-Tax Contributions that
         exceed the Code Section 402(g) limit and are eligible to be treated as
         Catch-up Contributions shall be re-characterized as Catch-up
         Contributions pursuant to Code Section 414(v). Any such
         recharacterization shall be deemed to occur first from Pre-Tax
         Contributions that are not associated with any Matching Contributions."

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                SUSPENSION PERIOD FOLLOWING HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTION

         Section 9.7 of the Plan is amended by adding a new subsection 9.7.9 as
follows:

                  "A Participant who receives a distribution on account of
         hardship after December 31, 2002, shall be prohibited from making
         Pre-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions under this Plan and
         all other plans of the Employer for six (6) months after receipt of the
         hardship distribution."

         contributions, qualified matching contributions, and earnings
         attributable to these contributions shall be distributed on account of
         the Participant's severance from employment. However, such a
         distribution shall be subject to the other provisions of the Plan
         regarding distributions, other than provisions that require a
         separation form service before such amounts may be distributed."

                                    ARTICLE X

its entirety to read as follows:

         amounts from one percent (1%) to thirty percent (30%) of the Active
         Participant's Compensation for each payroll period for which his
         election to make Pre-Tax Contributions is in effect. Such maximum
         percentage shall, however, be reduced by the amount of After-Tax
         Contributions contributed by such Active Participant, in accordance
         with such rules as the Committee may prescribe."

                                   ARTICLE XI

         Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions for the contribution cycle, not to

                                   ARTICLE XII

         Article 9 of the Plan is revised by adding a new Section 9.14 to the

                  9.14.1    GENERAL RULES.

                            (a)      Effective Date. The provisions of this
                  article will apply for purposes of determining required
                  minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the

                            (b)      Precedence.  The requirements of this
                  article will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions
                  of the Plan.

                            (c)      Requirements of Treasury Regulations
                  Incorporated.  All distributions required under this article

                                    (i)      If the Participant's surviving
                            Spouse is the Participant's sole designated
                            beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving

                            calendar year in which the Participant would have
                            attained age 70 1/2, if later.

                                    (ii)     If the Participant's surviving
                            Spouse is not the Participant's sole designated
                            beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated
                            beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the
                            calendar year immediately following the calendar
                            year in which the Participant died.

                                    (iii)    If there is no designated
                            beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following
                            the year of the Participant's death, the
                            Participant's entire interest will be distributed by
                            December 31 of the calendar year containing the
                            fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.

                                    (iv)     If the Participant's surviving
                            Spouse is the Participant's sole designated
                            beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after the
                            Participant but before distributions to the
                            surviving Spouse begin, this section 9.14.2(b),
                            other than section 9.14.2(b)(i), will apply as if
                            the surviving Spouse were the Participant.

                  For purposes of this section 9.14.2(b) and Section 9.14.4,
                  unless section 9.14.2(b)(iv) applies, distributions are
                  considered to begin on the Participant's required beginning
                  date. If section 9.14.2(b)(iv) applies, distributions are
                  considered to begin on the date distributions are required to
                  begin to the surviving Spouse under section 9.14.2(b)(i). If
                  distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance
                  company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the
                  Participant's required beginning date (or to the Participant's
                  surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to
                  begin to the surviving Spouse under section 9.14.2(b)(i), the
                  date distributions are considered to begin is the date
                  distributions actually commence.

                            (c)      Forms of Distribution. Unless the
                  Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an
                  annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum
                  on or before the required beginning date, as of the first
                  distribution calendar year distributions will be made in
                  accordance with sections 9.14.3 and 9.14.4 of this article. If
                  the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an
                  annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions

                  Each Distribution Calendar Year. During the Participant's
                  lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each
                  distribution calendar year is the lesser of:

                                    (i)      the quotient obtained by dividing
                            the Participant's account balance by the
                            distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table
                            set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
                            regulations, using the Participant's age as of the

                            year; or

                                    (ii)     if the Participant's sole

                            year is the Participant's Spouse, the quotient
                            obtained by dividing the Participant's account
                            balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor
                            Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the
                            Treasury regulations, using the Participant's and
                            Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and
                            Spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar
                            year.

                  and including the distribution calendar year that includes the
                  Participant's date of death.

                            Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the
                            date distributions begin and there is a designated
                            beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be
                            distributed for each distribution calendar year
                            after the year of the Participant's death is the
                            quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's
                            account balance by the longer of the remaining life
                            expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life
                            expectancy of the Participant's designated

                                             (1)      The Participant's
                                    remaining life expectancy is calculated
                                    using the age of the Participant in the year
                                    of death, reduced by one for each subsequent
                                    year.

                                             (2)      If the Participant's
                                    surviving spouse is the Participant's sole
                                    designated beneficiary, the remaining life
                                    expectancy of the surviving Spouse is
                                    calculated for each distribution calendar
                                    year after the year of the Participant's
                                    death using the surviving Spouse's age as of
                                    the Spouse's birthday in that year. For
                                    distribution calendar years after the year
                                    of the surviving Spouse's death, the
                                    remaining life expectancy of the surviving
                                    Spouse is calculated using the age of the
                                    surviving Spouse as of the Spouse's birthday
                                    in the calendar year of the Spouse's death,

                                    year.

                                             (3)      If the Participant's
                                    surviving Spouse is not the Participant's
                                    sole designated beneficiary, the designated
                                    beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is
                                    calculated using the age of the beneficiary
                                    in the year following the year of the
                                    Participant's death, reduced by one for each
                                    subsequent year.

                                    (ii)     No Designated Beneficiary. If the
                            Participant dies on or after the date distributions

                            September 30 of the year after the year of the
                            Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be
                            distributed for each distribution calendar year
                            after the year of the Participant's death is the
                            quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's
                            account balance by the Participant's remaining life
                            expectancy calculated using the age of the
                            Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for
                            each subsequent year.

                            distributed for each distribution calendar year
                            after the year of the Participant's death is the
                            quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's
                            account balance by the remaining life expectancy of
                            the Participant's designated beneficiary, determined
                            as provided in section 9.14.4(a).

                                    (ii)No Designated Beneficiary. If the

                            9.14.4(b) will apply as if the surviving Spouse were

                  9.14.5    DEFINITIONS.

                  distribution calendar year will be made on or before the
                  Participant's required beginning date. The required minimum
                  distribution for other distribution calendar years, including
                  the required minimum distribution for the distribution
                  calendar year in which the Participant's required beginning
                  date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that
