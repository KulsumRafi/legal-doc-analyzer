                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

     This CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of December 20,
2002, by and among The Brickman Group, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), Antares Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation, as agent for
the several financial institutions from time to time party to this Agreement
(collectively, the "Lenders" and individually, each a "Lender") and for itself
as a Lender, General Electric Capital Corporation, as Syndication Agent, LaSalle
Bank National Association, as Documentation Agent, Harris Trust and Savings
Bank, as Co-Agent, and such Lenders.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested, and the Lenders have agreed to make
available to the Borrower, a revolving credit facility (including a letter of
credit subfacility) and a term loan upon and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and
covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                             ARTICLE I - THE CREDITS

     1.1 Amounts and Terms of Commitments.

     (a) The Term Loan. Each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment severally and
not jointly agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to lend
to the Borrower on the Closing Date, the amount set forth opposite such Lender's
name in Schedule 1.1(a) under the heading "Term Loan Commitment" (such amount
being referred to herein as such Lender's "Term Loan Commitment"). Amounts
borrowed under this subsection 1.1(a) are referred to as the "Term Loan."
Amounts borrowed as a Term Loan which are repaid or prepaid may not be
reborrowed.

     (b) The Revolving Credit. Each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment
severally and not jointly agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, to make Loans to the Borrower (each such Loan, a "Revolving Loan") from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the
Revolving Termination Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount set forth opposite such Lender's name in Schedule 1.1(b)
under the heading "Revolving Loan Commitment" (such amount as the same may be
reduced from time to time pursuant to subsection 1.8(f) hereof or as a result of
one or more assignments pursuant to Section 9.8, being referred to herein as
such Lender's "Revolving Loan Commitment"); provided, however, that, after
giving effect to any Borrowing of Revolving Loans, the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans shall not exceed the Maximum Revolving
Loan Balance. Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, amounts borrowed
under this subsection 1.1(b) may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time. The
"Maximum Revolving Loan Balance" from time to time will be the lesser of:

               (i) the "Borrowing Base" (as calculated pursuant to the Borrowing
          Base Certificate) in effect from time to time, or

<PAGE>

               (ii) the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment then in effect;

less, in either case, the amount of any Letter of Credit Participation
Liability.

If at any time the Revolving Loans exceed the Maximum Revolving Loan Balance,
then Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days, prepay Revolving Loans in an
amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

     (c) Lender Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Participation Agreements.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties of Borrower herein set forth, the Revolving Loan
Commitment may, in addition to advances under the Revolving Loan, be utilized,
upon the request of Borrower, for (i) the issuance of letters of credit by the
Issuing Lender (each such letter of credit, a "Lender Letter of Credit") or (ii)
the issuance of letter of credit participation agreements by the Issuing Lender
(each such letter of credit participation, a "Letter of Credit Participation
Agreement") to confirm payment to banks (whether or not such banks are Lenders)
which issue letters of credit for the account of Borrower on behalf of each
Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment (severally and not jointly) according
to such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, provided in the event an Issuing
Lender refuses to issue Letter of Credit Participation Agreements, the Agent
shall be deemed the Issuing Lender with respect thereto. The aggregate amount of
Letter of Credit Participation Liability with respect to all Lender Letters of
Credit and Letter of Credit Participation Agreements outstanding at any time
shall not exceed $7,500,000.

     The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated forthwith
without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, to
reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amounts paid by the Issuing Lender under
any Lender Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Participation Agreement. The
Borrower hereby authorizes and directs the Lenders with Revolving Loan
Commitments, at the Issuing Lender's option, to make a Revolving Loan in the
amount of any payment made by the Issuing Lender with respect to any Lender
Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Participation Agreement. All amounts paid
by the Issuing Lender with respect to any Lender Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit Participation Agreement that are not immediately repaid by Borrower with
the proceeds of a Revolving Loan or otherwise shall bear interest at the
interest rate then applicable to Revolving Loans, calculated using the Base Rate
and the Applicable Margin then in effect. Each Lender agrees to fund its
Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Loan made pursuant to this subsection
1.1(c) and, if no such Revolving Loans are made, each Lender with a Revolving
Loan Commitment agrees to purchase, and shall be deemed to have purchased, a
participation in such Lender Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Participation
Agreement in an amount equal to its ratable share of such Lender Letter of
Credit or Letter of Credit Participation Agreement based upon the Revolving Loan
Commitments then in effect and each Lender agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender
such share of any payments made by the Issuing Lender under such Lender Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit Participation Agreement. The obligations of each
Lender under the preceding two (2) sentences shall be absolute and unconditional
and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation
of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set
forth in Section 2.2 hereof.

                                       2

<PAGE>

     In addition to all other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the issuance by Issuing Lender of any Lender Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit Participation Agreement shall be subject to the condition precedent that
the Lender Letter of Credit, Letter of Credit Participation Agreement or the
letter of credit or written contract for which Borrower requests a Letter of
Credit Participation Agreement shall support a transaction entered into by
Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business, or
otherwise reasonably acceptable to Issuing Lender, and shall be in such form, be
for such amount, and contain such terms in connection with the issuance thereof
as are reasonably satisfactory to Issuing Lender.

     The expiration date of each Lender Letter of Credit shall be on a date
which is the earlier of (a) one year from its date of issuance (except with
respect to Lender Letters of Credit in support of letters of credit issued by
Fleet National Bank and in existence on the date hereof, which may expire as
late as twenty (20) Business Days after the expiry date of the last relevant
letter of credit issued by Fleet National Bank), or (b) the fifth (5th) day
before the Revolving Termination Date. Each Letter of Credit Participation
Agreement shall provide that the Letter of Credit Participation Agreement
terminates and all demands or claims for payment must be presented by a date
certain, which date will be the earlier of (a) one year from its date of
issuance, or (b) the fifth (5th) day before the Revolving Termination Date.

     Borrower shall give Agent and Issuing Lender at least ten (10) Business
Days' prior written notice specifying the date a Lender Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Participation Agreement is to be issued, identifying the
beneficiary and describing the nature of the transactions proposed to be
supported thereby. The notice shall be accompanied by the drawing terms for the
Lender Letter of Credit or form of each letter of credit or other written
contract which will be supported by the Letter of Credit Participation
Agreement. Borrower shall also, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
requested issuance date, execute and deliver an application for such Lender
Letter of Credit to the Issuing Lender on the form then customarily prescribed
for such type of Lender Letter of Credit by the Issuing Lender.

     Harris shall be the initial Issuing Lender with respect to Lender Letters
of Credit and shall remain so for as long as Harris maintains a Revolving Loan
Commitment, provided, however that any Issuing Lender may resign as Issuing
Lender upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to Agent and to Borrower.

     1.2 Notes.

     (a) The Term Loan made by each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment shall be
evidenced by a Term Note payable to the order of such Lender in an amount equal
to such Lender's Term Loan Commitment.

     (b) The Revolving Loans made by each Lender with a Revolving Loan
Commitment shall be evidenced by a Revolving Note payable to the order of such
Lender in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment.

     1.3 Interest.

                                       3

<PAGE>

     (a) Subject to subsections 1.3(c) and 1.3(d), each Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the date when made at a rate
per annum equal to the LIBOR or the Base Rate, as the case may be, plus the
Applicable Margin, as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the
definition of Applicable Margin. The Agent will with reasonable promptness
notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each
such change, provided that any failure to provide such notice shall not relieve
the Borrower of any liability hereunder or provide the basis for any claim
against the Agent. Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of
manifest error. All computations of fees and interest payable under this
Agreement (other than the Agent's Fees) shall be made on the basis of a 360-day
year and actual days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period
during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to
but (subject to the provisions of subsections 1.10(a) and 1.10(b) hereof)
excluding the last day thereof.

     (b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any payment or prepayment of
Loans in full.

     (c) At the election of the Agent or the Required Lenders while any Event of
Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry
of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the Obligations from and
after the date of occurrence of such Event of Default, at a rate per annum which
is determined by adding two percent (2.00%) per annum to the Applicable Margin
then in effect for such Loans (plus the LIBOR or Base Rate, as the case may be)
and, in the case of Obligations not subject to an Applicable Margin (other than
the fees described in Section 1.9), at a rate per annum equal to the rate per
annum applicable to Revolving Loans which are Base Rate Loans (including the
Applicable Margin with respect thereto) plus two percent (2.00%); provided,
however, that, on and after the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
any LIBOR Rate Loan outstanding during the continuance of such Event of Default,
the principal amount of such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event
of Default, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin plus two percent (2.00%). All such interest shall be payable
on demand of the Agent or the Required Lenders.

     (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest
shall not be required, for any period for which interest is computed hereunder,
to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such
payment by the respective Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law
applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest which may be
lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such event
the Borrower shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted by
applicable law.

     1.4 Loan Accounts. The Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall record on its
books and records the amount of each Loan made, the interest rate applicable,
all payments of principal and interest thereon and the principal balance thereof
from time to time outstanding. The Agent shall deliver to the Borrower on a
monthly basis a loan statement setting forth such record for the immediately
preceding month. Such record shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive
evidence of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the
interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing
so, or any failure to deliver such loan

                                       4

<PAGE>

statement shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
Borrower hereunder (and under any Note) to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Loans or provide the basis for any claim against the Agent.

     1.5 Procedure for Revolving Credit Borrowing.

     (a) Each Borrowing under the Revolving Loan shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable (subject to Section 10.5 hereof) written notice delivered
to the Agent in the form of a Notice of Borrowing, which notice must be received
by the Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) (i) on the requested Borrowing
date in the case of each Base Rate Loan equal to or less than $1,000,000 and in
the case of the initial Loans to be made on the Closing Date, (ii) on the date
which is one (1) Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing date of each Base
Rate Loan in excess of $1,000,000 but equal to or less than $3,000,000 and (iii)
on the day which is three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing
date in the case of each LIBOR Rate Loan and each Base Rate Loan in excess of
$3,000,000; provided that with respect to Loans subsequent to the initial Loans,
the Borrower may give notice of the requested Borrowing to the Agent by
telephone call, with such notice confirmed not later than the following Business
Day by delivery to the Agent of a signed Notice of Borrowing. Such Notice of
Borrowing shall specify:

               (i) the amount of the Borrowing (which shall be in an aggregate
          minimum principal amount of $100,000 and multiples of $50,000 in
          excess thereof);

               (ii) the requested Borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether the Borrowing is to be comprised of LIBOR Rate
          Loans or Base Rate Loans; and

               (iv) if the Borrowing is to be LIBOR Rate Loans, the Interest
          Period applicable to such Loans.

provided, however, that with respect to the Borrowing to be made on the Closing
Date, such Borrowing will consist of Base Rate Loans only and shall remain so
for not less than three (3) Business Days. Thereafter, Borrower may request that
Revolving Loans be made as LIBOR Rate Loans and that Loans be converted to or
continued as LIBOR Rate Loans (it being agreed that a Notice of
Continuation/Conversion may be delivered on the Closing Date).

     (b) Upon receipt of the Notice of Borrowing, the Agent will promptly notify
each Lender with a Commitment affected thereby of such Notice and of the amount
of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing.

     (c) Unless Agent is otherwise directed in writing by Borrower, the proceeds
of each requested Borrowing after the Closing Date will be made available to the
Borrower by the Agent by wire transfer (or ACH transfer) of such amount to the
Borrower pursuant to the wire transfer instructions specified on the signature
page hereto.

                                       5

<PAGE>

     1.6 Conversion and Continuation Elections.

     (a) The Borrower may upon irrevocable (subject to subsection 10.2(c) and
Section 10.5) written notice to the Agent in accordance with subsection 1.6(b)
elect to convert on any Business Day, any Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Rate Loans
or elect to continue on the last day of the applicable Interest Period any LIBOR
Rate Loans having Interest Periods maturing on such day, in each instance, in
whole or in part in an amount not less than $100,000, or that is in an integral
multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof.

     (b) The Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Continuation/Conversion to be
received by the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three
(3) Business Days in advance of the requested Conversion Date or continuation
date, specifying:

               (i) the proposed Conversion Date or continuation date;

               (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or continued;
          and

               (iii) the duration of the requested Interest Period with respect
          to the Loans to be converted or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans.

     (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR Rate
Loans, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be

the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Rate Loans
into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current
Interest Period.

     (d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Continuation/Conversion, the Agent will
promptly notify each Lender thereof. In addition, the Agent will, with
reasonable promptness, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination

any liability hereunder or provide the basis for any claim against the Agent.
All conversions and continuations shall be made pro rata according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the
notice was given held by each Lender.

     (e) Unless the Agent or the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree, during
the existence of an Event of Default, the Borrower may not elect to have a Loan
converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan.

     (f) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, after
giving effect to any Borrowing, or to any continuation or conversion of any
Loans, there shall not be more than seven (7) different Interest Periods in
effect.

date specified in clause (a) of the definition of "Revolving Termination Date"

any time or from time to time:

               (i) consummate a Disposition; or

               (ii) suffer an Event of Loss;

and the aggregate amount of the Net Proceeds received by Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Disposition or Event of Loss and all other
Dispositions and Events of Loss occurring during the fiscal year exceeds
$250,000, then (A) the Borrower shall promptly notify the Agent of such
Disposition or Event of Loss (including the amount of the Net Proceeds to be
received by the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries in respect thereof) and
(B) promptly upon receipt by the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries of the
Net Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, the Borrower shall deliver
such Net Proceeds to the Agent for distribution to the Lenders as a prepayment
of the Loans, which prepayment shall be applied in accordance with subsection
1.8(f) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, such prepayment shall not be required to
the extent the Borrower (I) notifies the Agent in writing of its election to (x)
reinvest the Net Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, or a portion
thereof, in productive assets of a kind then used or usable in the business of
the Borrower within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such

within said one hundred eighty (180) day period, and (II) the Borrower, in fact,
(x) so reinvests such Net Proceeds, or such portion thereof, within said one
hundred eighty (180) day period or (y) enters into a binding commitment thereof
and subsequently makes such reinvestment. Pending such reinvestment, the Net
Proceeds shall be delivered to the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders, as a
prepayment of the Revolving Loans, but not as a permanent reduction of the
Revolving Loan Commitment. Any portion of Net Proceeds not reinvested as
provided herein shall applied as a prepayment of the Loans, which prepayment
shall be applied in accordance with subsection 1.8(f) hereof.

Proceeds from the issuance of (i) debt securities in respect of Indebtedness
permitted hereunder, (ii) equity securities to management, (iii) equity
securities, the proceeds of which are used to finance Permitted Acquisitions and
Capital Expenditures permitted hereunder, (iv) equity securities issued on the
Closing Date and (v) provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, equity securities issued after the Closing Date to Persons who are
stockholders of Holdings on the Closing Date), Borrower shall deliver to Agent
an amount equal to such Net Issuance Proceeds, net of underwriting discounts
associated therewith, for application to the Loans in accordance with subsection
1.8(f).

     (e) Excess Cash Flow. Within five (5) days after the annual financial
statements are required to be delivered under subsection 4.1(a) hereof,
commencing with the year ending December 31, 2003, the Borrower (i) shall
deliver to the Agent a written calculation of Excess Cash Flow of the Borrower
for such year (the "Calculation Year") in the form of Exhibit 1.8(e) and
certified as correct on behalf of Borrower by a Responsible Officer and (ii)
concurrently therewith shall deliver to the Agent, for distribution to the
Lenders, an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of such Excess Cash Flow,
for application to the Loans in accordance with the provisions of subsection
1.8(f) hereof, provided, however, that the Borrower shall only be required to
deliver to Agent, for distribution to the Lenders, an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of such Excess Cash Flow for application to the Loans in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 1.8(f) hereof in the event (A) the
ratio (the "Modified Leverage Ratio") of (i) Total Indebtedness minus
unrestricted cash on hand held in deposit accounts in which Agent shall have
been granted a perfected first priority security interest pursuant to Deposit
Account Control Agreements, in each instance, calculated as of such payment date
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment to (ii) Adjusted EBITDA
(as calculated in Exhibit 4.2(b)) for the most recent twelve (12) month period
for which financial statements are available is less than 3.5 to 1.0 and (B) the
Credit Level of the Loans shall be Level I or Level II as of the date the
payment is required to be made; and provided further that no prepayment (or only
a portion thereof as shall be necessary for Borrower's Modified Leverage Ratio
to equal 3.0 as provided in clause (A) below) shall be required in the event (A)
the Borrower's Modified Leverage Ratio as of such payment date is less than 3.0
after giving effect to any payment or portion thereof which is actually made on
such date and (B) the Credit Level of the Loans as of the date the payment would
otherwise be required to be made shall be Level I. Excess Cash Flow shall be
calculated in the manner set forth in Exhibit 1.8(e).

     (f) Application of Prepayments. Any prepayments pursuant to Section 1.7 or
subsections 1.8(c) (other than prepayments of Revolving Loans as set forth
therein), 1.8(d) or 1.8(e) shall be applied first to prepay installments of the
Term Loan coming due pro rata against all such scheduled installments based upon
the respective amounts thereof, and then in permanent reduction of the Revolving
Loan, whereupon the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender shall automatically
and permanently be reduced by an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share of
the aggregate of principal repaid, effective as of the earlier of the date that
such prepayment is made or the date by which such prepayment is due and payable
hereunder. To the extent permitted by the foregoing sentence, amounts prepaid
shall be applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to
outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans with the shortest Interest Periods remaining.
Together with each prepayment under this Section 1.8, the Borrower shall pay any
amounts required pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof.

     1.9 Fees.

     (a) Closing, Arrangement and Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the

the Lenders having Revolving Loan Commitments, a fee (the "Commitment Fee") in

               (ii) the sum of (x) the average daily balance of all Revolving
          Loans outstanding plus (y) the average daily amount of the Letter of
          Credit Participation Liability, in each case, during the preceding
          month,

multiplied by one-half of one percent (0.50%) per annum, such fee to be payable
monthly in arrears on the first day of the month following the date hereof and
the first day of each month thereafter. The Commitment Fee provided in this
subsection 1.9(b) shall accrue at all times from and after mutual execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

     (c) Letter of Credit Participation Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent, for
the ratable benefit of the Lenders having Revolving Loan Commitments, fees for
each Lender Letter of Credit and each Letter of Credit Participation Agreement
(the "Letter of Credit Participation Fee") for the period from and including the
date of issuance of same to and excluding the date of expiration or termination,
equal to the average daily amount of Letter of Credit Participation Liability
multiplied by a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect for
Revolving Loans that are LIBOR Rate Loans; provided, however, at Agent's or
Required Lenders' option, while an Event of Default exists such Applicable
Margin shall be increased by two percent (2.00%) per annum, such fees to be
payable monthly in arrears on the first day of the month following the date
hereof and the first day of each month thereafter. Borrower shall also reimburse
Agent for, or pay, any and all fees and expenses, if any, paid by Agent, or
required to be paid, to the issuer (including the Issuing Lender) of any Lender
Letter of Credit or any letter of credit subject to a Letter of Credit
Participation Agreement.

     1.10 Payments by the Borrower.

     (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on
account of principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall
be made without set-off, recoupment, counterclaim or deduction of any kind,
shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to the Agent for
the ratable account of the Lenders at the address for payment specified on the
signature page hereof in relation to the Agent (or such other address as Agent
may from time to time specify in accordance with Section 9.2), and shall be made
in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 12:00 noon.
(Chicago time) on the date due. Any payment which is received by the Agent later
than 12:00 noon (Chicago time) shall be deemed to have been received on the

continue to accrue. Borrower hereby authorizes Agent and each Lender to make a
Revolving Loan (which shall be a Base Rate Loan) to pay (i) interest, principal,
agent fees, Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit Participation Fees, in each

Borrower, other fees, costs or expenses payable by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest
Period" herein, if any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or fees, as the case may be.

     (c) Except for payments collected or received prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default in respect of a specific Obligation, all amounts collected or
received by Agent shall be applied as follows:

          first, to payment of costs and expenses, including Attorney Costs, of
     Agent payable or reimbursable by Borrower under the Loan Documents;

          second, to payment of Attorney Costs of Lenders payable or
     reimbursable by Borrower under this Agreement;

          third, to payment of all accrued unpaid fees (including fees payable
     to Agent) and interest then due and owing on the Obligations;

          fourth, to payment of principal of the Obligations (including, if an
     Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, cash collateralization of
     Letter of Credit Participation Liability);

          fifth, to payment of any other amounts owing constituting Obligations;

          sixth, to payment of Rate Contract Obligations then due and owing; and

          seventh, any remainder shall be for the account of and paid to whoever
     may be lawfully entitled thereto.

     In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; (ii) each of the Agent and Lenders shall receive an amount
equal to its pro rata share of amounts available to be applied pursuant to
clauses second, third, fourth and fifth above.

     1.11 Payments by the Lenders to the Agent; Settlement.

     (a) As set forth in subsection 1.5(b), upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing, the Agent will promptly notify each Lender of such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing requested thereby. Each Lender with a
Revolving Loan Commitment will fund its Commitment Percentage of Borrowings of
Revolving Loans to Agent at Agent's account specified on Agent's signature page
hereto, or to such other account as Agent may designate in writing, no later
than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the scheduled Borrowing date.

     (b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender on the
Closing Date or, with respect to each Borrowing after the Closing Date, by 12:00
p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of any proposed Borrowing, that such Lender will
not make available to the Agent as and when required hereunder for the account
of the Borrower the amount of such Lender's

                                       11

<PAGE>

Commitment Percentage of the proposed Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each
Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available
funds on the applicable Borrowing date and the Agent may (but shall not be so
required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have
made its full amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds and
the Agent in such circumstances has made available to the Borrower such amount,
that Lender shall on the next Business Day following the date of such Borrowing
make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal
Funds Rate for and determined as of each day during such period. A notice of the
Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this
subsection 1.11(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is
so made available, such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Lender's Loan
on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is
not made available to the Agent on the next Business Day following the date of
such Borrowing, the Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure to fund and,
no later than one (1) Business Day after demand by the Agent, the Borrower shall
pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest
thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per
annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising
such Borrowing.

     (c) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date of Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date
of any Borrowing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender
shall be obligated to fund its Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Loan made
after any acceleration of the Obligations with respect to any draw on any Lender
Letter of Credit or any payment made under any Letter of Credit Participation
Agreement.

     (d) Provided that such Lender has made all payments required to be made by
it under this Agreement, the Agent will pay to such Lender, by wire transfer to
such Lender's account (as specified by such Lender on such Lender's respective
signature page to this Agreement or the applicable Assignment and Acceptance)
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of principal, interest, Commitment Fees and
Letter of Credit Participation Fees, in each instance, received by Agent,
promptly after Agent's receipt thereof.

     (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to
the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment in full as and when required hereunder, the Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date
in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required),
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If the Agent pays
an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a
related payment has been or will be received by the Agent from the Borrower and
such related payment is not received by the Agent, the Agent shall be entitled
to recover such amount from such Lender, and each Lender shall repay to Agent on
demand such amount, together with interest thereon for each day from the date
such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate,

                                       12

<PAGE>

without setoff, recoupment, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. If the Agent
determines at any time that any amount received by the Agent under this
Agreement must be returned to the Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant
to any solvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar law or otherwise, then,
notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, the Agent will
not be required to distribute any portion of such payment to any Lender. In
addition, each Lender will repay to the Agent on demand any portion of such
amount that the Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest
thereon at such rate, if any, as the Agent is required to pay to the Borrower or
such other Person, without setoff, recoupment, counterclaim or deduction of any
kind.

Agreement or other Loan Document that have been breached or violated.

     4.4 Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. The Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to:

     (a) preserve and maintain in full force and effect its organizational
existence and good standing under the laws of its state or jurisdiction of
incorporation, organization or formation, as applicable, except, with respect to
Borrower's Subsidiaries, in connection with transactions permitted by Section
5.3;

     (b) preserve and maintain in full force and effect all rights, privileges,
qualifications, permits, licenses and franchises necessary in the normal conduct
of its business except in connection with transactions permitted by Section 5.3
and sales of assets permitted by Section 5.2 and except as would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect;

     (c) use its reasonable efforts, in the Ordinary Course of Business, and in
the reasonable business judgment of the Borrower, to preserve its business
organization and preserve

                                       28

<PAGE>

the goodwill and business of the customers, suppliers and others having material
business relations with it; and

     (d) preserve or renew all of its registered trademarks, trade names and
service marks, the non-preservation of which would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.5 Maintenance of Property. The Borrower shall maintain, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, and preserve all of its Property which is
used or useful in its business in good working order and condition, ordinary
wear and tear and damage by casualty (subject to Borrower's obligation to repair
to the extent insurance proceeds therefrom are not used to prepay Loans)
excepted, and shall make all necessary repairs thereto and renewals and
replacements thereof in each case except where the failure to do so would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

     4.6 Insurance. The Borrower shall maintain, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to its Properties and business, in all material respects
consistent with that described in Schedule 3.20. All property damage and
casualty insurance shall name the Agent as loss payee/mortgagee and all
liability insurance shall name the Agent and the Lenders as additional insureds.
Subject to the provisions of subsection 1.8(c), to the extent Agent receives Net
Proceeds of property damage or casualty insurance, Agent shall make such Net
Proceeds available to Borrower to repair and reconstruct Borrower's Property to
the extent covered thereby. Upon request of the Agent or any Lender, the
Borrower shall furnish the Agent, with sufficient copies for each Lender, at
reasonable intervals (but not more than once per calendar year) a certificate of
a Responsible Officer on behalf of Borrower (and, if requested by the Agent, any
insurance broker of the Borrower) setting forth the nature and extent of all
insurance maintained by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
this Section 4.6. Unless Borrower provides Agent with evidence of the insurance
coverage required by this Agreement, Agent may purchase insurance at Borrower's
expense to protect Agent's and Lenders' interests in Borrower's and its
Subsidiaries' Properties. This insurance may, but need not, protect Borrower's
and its Subsidiaries' interests. The coverage that Agent purchases may not pay
any claim that Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower makes or any claim that is
made against Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower in connection with said
Property. Borrower may later cancel any insurance purchased by Agent, but only
after providing Agent with evidence that Borrower has obtained insurance as
required by this Agreement. If Agent purchases insurance, Borrower will be
responsible for the costs of that insurance, including interest and any other
charges Agent may impose in connection with the placement of insurance, until
the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The costs
of the insurance may be added to the Obligations. The costs of the insurance may
be more than the cost of insurance Borrower may be able to obtain on its own.

     4.7 Payment of Obligations. The Borrower shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, pay, discharge and perform:

     (a) all material tax liabilities, assessments and governmental charges or
levies upon it or its Properties or assets, unless the same are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently prosecuted which stay the
enforcement of any Lien and for which

                                       29

<PAGE>

adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP are being maintained by the Borrower
or such Subsidiary;

     (b) all material lawful claims which, if unpaid, would by law become a Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon its Property unless the same are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently prosecuted which
stay the imposition or enforcement of the Lien and for which adequate reserves
in accordance with GAAP are being maintained by Borrower or such Subsidiary;

     (c) all Indebtedness, as and when due and payable, but subject to any
subordination provisions contained herein and/or in any instrument or agreement
evidencing such Indebtedness, the non-payment of all or any portion of which
would result in an Event of Default under subsection 7.1(e); and

     (d) all obligations under any Contractual Obligation (other than
obligations with respect to Indebtedness) to which Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, or to which it or any of its Properties is subject,
except where the failure to perform would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

     4.8 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower shall comply, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all Requirements
of Law of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over it or its business
(including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws), except (a) (i) such as
may be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently prosecuted
without risk of loss of any Collateral, (ii) as to which a bona fide dispute
exists, and (iii) for which appropriate reserves have been established on the
Borrower's financial statements, or (b) where the failure to comply could not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

     4.9 Inspection of Property and Books and Records. The Borrower shall
maintain, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, proper books of
record and account, in which full, true and correct entries in conformity with
GAAP consistently applied shall be made of all financial transactions and
matters involving the assets and business of the Borrower and such Subsidiaries.
The Borrower shall permit, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to permit,
representatives and independent contractors of the Agent (at the expense of the
Borrower, provided that Borrower shall be responsible for such expenses not more
than one (1) time per year unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing), or any Lender accompanying Agent (at such Lender's expense unless
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), to visit and inspect
any of their respective Properties, to conduct appraisals, to examine their
respective corporate, financial and operating records, and make copies thereof
or abstracts therefrom, and to discuss their respective affairs, finances and
accounts with their respective directors, officers, and independent public
accountants (Borrower shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at any
meeting with Borrower's independent public accountants), at such reasonable
times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably desired,
upon reasonable advance notice to the Borrower; provided, however, when an Event
of Default exists the Agent or any Lender may do any of the foregoing at the
expense of the Borrower at any time during normal business hours and without
advance notice.

                                       30

     4.10 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loans
solely as follows: (a) to partially refinance the Prior Indebtedness, (b) to pay
costs and expenses of the Related Transactions and costs and expenses required
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1, (c) to consummate Permitted Acquisitions and
(d) for working capital and other general corporate purposes not in
contravention of any Requirement of Law and not in violation of this Agreement.

     4.11 Further Assurances.

     (a) The Borrower shall ensure that all written information, exhibits and
reports taken as a whole furnished by Sponsor (with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby), Holdings, Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries concerning
Holdings, Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the Agent or the
Lenders do not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and
do not and will not omit to state any material fact or any fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances in which made, and will promptly disclose to the Agent and the
Lenders and correct any defect or error that may be discovered therein or in any
Loan Document or in the execution, acknowledgement or recordation thereof. Agent
and Lenders recognize that the projections delivered pursuant to this Agreement
are not to be viewed as fact, that actual results may vary from such projections
and that Borrower does not make any representation that such projections will be
realized.

     (b) Promptly upon written request by Agent, the Borrower shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) take such additional actions as the Agent may
reasonably require from time to time in order (i) to subject to the Liens
created by any of the Collateral Documents any of the Properties, rights or
interests covered by any of the Collateral Documents, (ii) to perfect and
maintain the validity, effectiveness and priority of any of the Collateral
Documents and the Liens intended to be created thereby, and (iii) to better
assure, convey, grant, assign, transfer, preserve, protect and confirm to the
Agent and Lenders the rights granted or now or hereafter intended to be granted
to the Agent and the Lenders under any Loan Document or under any other document
executed in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and except as otherwise approved in writing by the Lenders, Borrower
shall (x) cause each of its Subsidiaries to guaranty the Obligations, (y) cause
each such Subsidiary to grant to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, a
security interest in all of such Subsidiary's Property to secure such guaranty
and (z) deliver to Agent, such opinions of counsel as Agent may reasonably
request. Furthermore and except as otherwise approved in writing by the Lenders,
Borrower shall pledge the stock or other equity interests of each of its
Subsidiaries to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, to secure the
Obligations. In connection with each pledge of stock or other equity interests,
Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Agent, the items described
in subsection 2.1(d)(iii), if applicable, and such opinions of counsel as Agent
may reasonably request.

                         ARTICLE V - NEGATIVE COVENANTS

     The Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any Lender shall have
any Commitment hereunder, or any Loan or other Obligation (other than contingent

asserted) shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied, unless the Required Lenders waive
compliance in writing:

terminated;

     (b) declare all or any portion of the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other
amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be
immediately due and payable; without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;
and

     (c) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and remedies
available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in
subsections 7.1(f) or 7.1(g) above (in the case of clause (i) of subsection
7.1(g) upon the expiration of the sixty (60) day period mentioned therein), the
obligation of each Lender to make Loans and the obligation of Agent to issue
Lender Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Participation Agreements shall

and payable without further act of the Agent or any Lender.

     7.3 Rights Not Exclusive. The rights provided for in this Agreement and the

instrument, document or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

     7.4 Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit. If an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or this Agreement (or the Revolving Loan Commitment)
shall be terminated for any reason, then the Agent may, and upon request of
Lenders holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the Revolving Loan Commitments
shall, demand (which demand shall be deemed to have been delivered automatically
upon any acceleration of the Loans and other obligations hereunder pursuant to
Section 7.2 hereof or upon payment in full of the Term Loan), and Borrower shall
thereupon deliver to the Agent, to be held for the benefit of the Agent and the
Lenders entitled thereto, an amount of cash equal to the amount of Letter of
Credit Participation Liability (determined in accordance with subsection 1.1(c)
hereof) as additional collateral security for Borrower's Obligations in respect
of any outstanding Lender Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit

                                       49

<PAGE>

Participation Agreement. The Agent may at any time apply any or all of such cash
and cash collateral to the payment of any or all of Borrower's Obligations in
respect of any Lender Letters of Credit or Letter of Credit Participation
Agreements. Pending such application, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to) invest the same in an interest bearing account in the Agent's name, for the
benefit of the Agent and the Lenders entitled thereto, under which deposits are
available for immediate withdrawal, at such bank or financial institution as the
Agent may, in its discretion, select.

                            ARTICLE VIII - THE AGENT

     8.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints,
designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.

     8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

     8.3 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to
any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer
thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or for the value of any Collateral or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other party
to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or
to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements
contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to
inspect the Properties, books or records of the Borrower or any of the
Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     8.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and

                                       50

<PAGE>

upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall
be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Lenders (or, where an action or waiver need only be
approved by the Required Lenders, by the Required Lenders) as it deems
appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a
request or consent of the Lenders (or, where an action or waiver need only be
approved by the Required Lenders, by the Required Lenders) and such request and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of
the Lenders.

     8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect
to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have
received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VII; provided,
however, that unless and until the Agent shall have received any such request,
the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

     8.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and that no
act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal
of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, Property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated thereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, Property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with
any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
Property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower
which may come into the possession of the Agent.

                                       51

<PAGE>

     8.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated, upon demand therefor the Lenders shall indemnify the Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind whatsoever which
may at any time (including at any time following the repayment of the Loans and
the termination or resignation of the Agent) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by
the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however,
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent of any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from the Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, each Lender shall reimburse
the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket
expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein
to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf
of the Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the
Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any
other reason) such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Agent under this Section 8.7, together with all related costs and
expenses (including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Lenders in this
Section 8.7 shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder.

     8.8 Agent in Individual Capacity. Antares and its Affiliates may make loans
to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire
equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory or other business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates as though Antares were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to
or consent of the Lenders. With respect to its Loans, Antares shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
shall include Antares in its individual capacity. Each other Lender and the
Affiliates of each such Lender may make loans to, issue letters of credit for
the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

     8.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days'
prior notice to the Lenders and to Borrower. If the Agent shall resign as Agent
under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent for the Lenders,

                                       52

<PAGE>

which successor shall, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, be
reasonably acceptable to Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed prior to
the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may thereupon
appoint a successor agent from among the Lenders reasonably acceptable to
Borrower. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article VIII and Sections 9.4 and 9.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation
(or, if later, ten (10) days after the date upon which the Agent designates a
successor agent), the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon
become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above.

     8.10 Collateral Matters.

     (a) The Agent is authorized (but not required) on behalf of all the
Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from the
Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or
the Collateral Documents which may be necessary to perfect and maintain
perfected the security interest in and Liens upon the Collateral granted
pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

     (b) The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option and in its
discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any
Collateral:

               (i) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of
          all Loans and all other Obligations then payable under this Agreement
          and under any other Loan Document;

               (ii) constituting Property sold or to be sold or disposed of as
          part of or in connection with any disposition permitted hereunder;

               (iii) consisting of an instrument evidencing Indebtedness or of
          any other debt instrument, if the Indebtedness evidenced thereby has
          been paid in full; or

               (iv) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
          Required Lenders or all the Lenders, as the case may be, as provided
          in subsection 9.1(f).

Upon request by the Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the
Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to
this subsection 8.10(b). Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary, Agent may release Liens upon payment in full of the
Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no
unsatisfied claim has been asserted) notwithstanding that Rate Contract
Obligations may be outstanding.

                                       53

<PAGE>

     (c) Each Lender agrees with and in favor of each other Lender (which
agreement shall not be for the benefit of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) that the Borrower's Obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be equally and ratably secured by any Property and/or other
collateral now or hereafter securing any obligations of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries to such Lender, whether or not the same constitutes Collateral
hereunder.

     8.11 Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent and Co-Agent. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document, the Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent and Co-Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities in such capacities, nor shall the
Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent and Co-Agent have or be deemed to have
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent and Co-Agent.

                           ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS

     9.1 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, the Borrower and acknowledged by
the Agent, and then such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such
waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the
Lenders, the Borrower and acknowledged by the Agent, do any of the following:

     (a) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any
Commitment terminated pursuant to subsection 7.2(a));

     (b) postpone or delay any date fixed for, or waive, any payment of
principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them)
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (other than any postponement or delay
of any date fixed for any mandatory prepayment of the Loans pursuant to
subsection 1.8(c), 1.8(d) or 1.8(e));

     (c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein or
the amount of interest payable in cash specified herein on any Loan, or of any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

     (d) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Loans which shall be required for the Lenders or any of
them to take any action hereunder;

     (e) amend this Section 9.1 or the definition of Required Lenders or any
provision providing for consent or other action by all Lenders; or

                                       54

<PAGE>

     (f) discharge Holdings, Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower from their
respective Obligations under the Loan Documents, or release all or substantially
all of the Collateral except as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents;

and, provided further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Required Lenders or all the
Lenders, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     9.2 Notices.

     (a) All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder
shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides,
by facsimile transmission) and mailed by certified or registered mail, faxed or
delivered by personal or overnight delivery, to the address or facsimile number
specified for notices on the applicable signature page hereof; or, if directed
to the Borrower or the Agent, to such other address as shall be designated by
such party in a written notice to each of the other parties hereto given in
compliance herewith, or, if directed to any other party hereto, to such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice given in
compliance herewith to the Borrower and the Agent.

     (b) All such notices, requests and communications shall be effective (i) if
delivered in person, when delivered, (ii) if delivered by facsimile
transmission, on the date of transmission if transmitted on a Business Day
before 4:00 p.m. (Chicago time), otherwise on the next Business Day, (iii) if
delivered by overnight courier, one (1) Business Day after delivery to the
courier properly addressed and (iv) if mailed, upon the third (3rd) Business Day
after the date deposited into the U.S. Mail, certified or registered; except
that notices pursuant to Article I shall not be effective until actually
received by the Agent.

     (c) The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any agreement of the Agent
and the Lenders in Article I hereof to receive certain notices by telephone and
facsimile transmission is solely for the convenience and at the request of the
Borrower. The Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on the authority
of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the Borrower to give such
notice and the Agent and the Lenders shall not have any liability to the
Borrower or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by the
Agent or the Lenders in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The
obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans shall not be affected in any way
or to any extent by any failure by the Agent and/or the Lenders to receive
written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the
Agent and/or the Lenders of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms
understood by the Agent and/or the Lenders to be contained in the telephonic or
facsimile notice.

     9.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in
exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege. No course of dealing between Borrower, any Affiliate of
Borrower, Agent or any Lender shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge
any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. No provision
in any Loan Document and no course of dealing between the parties hereto or
thereto shall be deemed to

                                       55

<PAGE>

create a fiduciary duty owing by Agent or any Lender to Holdings, Borrower or
any of their Subsidiaries.

     9.4 Costs and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse:

     (a) Antares (including in its capacity as Agent) within five (5) Business
Days after demand (except as otherwise provided in subsection 2.1(f)) for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Antares (including in
its capacity as Agent) in connection with the development, preparation,
syndication, delivery, administration and execution of, and any amendment,
supplement, waiver or modification to (in each case, whether or not
consummated), this Agreement, any other Loan Document and any other documents
prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Attorney Costs
incurred by Antares (including in its capacity as Agent) with respect thereto
and for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any
rights or remedies during the existence of an Event of Default (including in
connection with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and
including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) under this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, and any such other documents;

     (b) Lenders within five (5) Business Days after demand for all Attorney
Costs of one law firm, on behalf of all Lenders (other than Antares) incurred by
them in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation
of any rights or remedies during the existence of an Event of Default (including
in connection with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and
including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) under this
Agreement, any other Loan Document; and

     (c) Agent within five (5) Business Days after demand for all out-of-pocket
appraisal, audit, environmental inspection and review (to the extent such
inspection or review is conducted as a result of Agent's reasonable belief that
a Default of subsection 4.3(e) or Section 4.8 may exist), in each case to the
extent permitted hereunder, search and filing costs, fees and expenses, incurred
or sustained by Agent in connection with the matters referred to under clause
(a) of this Section 9.4.

     9.5 Indemnity. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Lender,
the Agent and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, counsel,
agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, actual losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses or disbursements (including,
Attorney Costs):

     (a) subject to the limitations contained in subsection 9.4(b), of any kind
or nature whatsoever with respect to any investigation, litigation, action, suit
or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding)
related to this Agreement or the Loans, or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified
Person is a party thereto; and

                                       56

<PAGE>

     (b) which may be incurred by or asserted against such Indemnified Person in
connection with or arising out of any pending or threatened investigation,
litigation or proceeding, or any action taken by any Person, with respect to any
Environmental Claim arising out of or related to any Property of Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries;

(all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that
the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with
respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent arising from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified Person or its
officers, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

     No action taken by legal counsel chosen by the Agent or any Lender in
defending against any investigation, litigation or proceeding or requested
remedial, removal or response action shall vitiate or any way impair the
Borrower's obligation and duty hereunder to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent and each Lender. In no event shall any site visit, observation, or testing
by the Agent or any Lender (or any contractee of the Agent or any Lender) be
deemed a representation or warranty that Hazardous Materials are or are not
present in, on, or under, the site, or that there has been or shall be
compliance with any Environmental Law. Neither the Borrower nor any other Person
is entitled to rely on any site visit, observation, or testing by the Agent or
any Lender. Neither the Agent nor any Lender owes any duty of care to protect
the Borrower or any other Person against, or to inform the Borrower or any other
Person of, any Hazardous Materials or any other adverse condition affecting any
site or Property. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be obligated to
disclose to the Borrower or any other Person any report or findings made as a
result of, or in connection with, any site visit, observation, or testing by the
Agent or any Lender.

     The obligations in this Section 9.5 shall survive payment of all other
Obligations. At the election of any Indemnified Person, the Borrower shall
defend such Indemnified Person using legal counsel satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person in such Person's sole discretion, at the sole cost and
expense of the Borrower. All amounts owing under this Section 9.5 shall be paid
within thirty (30) days after demand.

     9.6 Marshaling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall
be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the Borrower or any
other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the
extent that the Borrower makes a payment or payments to the Agent or any Lender,
or the Agent or any Lender enforces its Liens or exercises its rights of setoff,
and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or
any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the Agent in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver
or any other party in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, or otherwise,
then:

     (a) to the extent of such recovery the Obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff
had not occurred; and

                                       57

<PAGE>

     (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its
ratable share of the total amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent.

     9.7 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided that any assignment by any Lender shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 9.8 hereof, and provided further that the
Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Agent and each Lender.

     9.8 Assignments, Participations, etc.

     (a) Any Lender may, with (A) the written consent of Borrower, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided that such consent shall not be
required (i) at any time that an Event of Default exists, (ii) in connection
with an assignment of a Term Loan to a Related Fund or (iii) in connection with
an assignment by Antares of the Term Loan, or any portion thereof, prior to
completion of the primary syndication), (B) the written consent of Agent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (C) with respect to any assignment of
any Revolving Loan Commitment, the written consent of all Issuing Lenders, at
any time assign and delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that
the written consent of the Agent or Borrower shall not be required in connection
with any assignment and delegation by a Lender to an Eligible Assignee that is
an Affiliate of such Lender) (each an "Assignee") all, or any part of, the
Loans, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations of such Lender
hereunder, in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount to which
Agent, in its sole discretion, may agree) or, if less, the entire Commitment or
Loan(s) of such Lender; provided, however, that the Borrower and the Agent may
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the
interest so assigned to an Assignee until:

               (i) written notice of such assignment, together with payment
          instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the
          Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrower and the Agent by such
          Lender and the Assignee;

               (ii) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the
          Borrower and the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in form and
          substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, such Lender and its
          Assignee (an "Assignment and Acceptance"); and

               (iii) the assignor Lender or the Assignee has paid to the Agent a
          processing fee in the amount of $3,500 provided no processing fee
          shall be required to be paid in connection with an assignment by a
          Lender to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such Lender.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of subsection 9.8(f) below, from and after
the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Lender that the Agent has received
and provided its consent with respect to an executed Assignment and Acceptance
and payment of the above-referenced processing fee:

                                       58

<PAGE>

               (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
          extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it
          pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and
          obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
          Documents; and

               (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that rights and
          obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been
          assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish
          its rights and be released from its obligations under the Loan
          Documents.

     (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection 9.8(f) below, immediately upon
the making of the processing fee payment to the Agent in respect of the
Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the
Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The
Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitment of the
assigning Lender to the same extent.

     (d) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or
other Persons not Affiliates of the Borrower (a "Participant") participating
interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Lender and the other interests of
that Lender (the "Originating Lender") hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents; provided, however, that:

               (i) the Originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement
          shall remain unchanged;

               (ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for
          the performance of such obligations;

               (iii) the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
          and directly with the Originating Lender in connection with the
          Originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
          the other Loan Documents; and

               (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest
          under which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment
          to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any
          other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment, consent or
          waiver would require unanimous consent of the Lenders as described in
          the first proviso to Section 9.1.

In the case of any such participation, the Participant shall not have any rights
under this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, and all amounts
payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not
sold such participation.

     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to the contrary, any Lender may (i) assign all or any
portion of the Loans held by it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States
Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Federal Reserve
Board and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, or (ii)
pledge all or any portion of the Loans held by it (and Notes evidencing

                                       59

<PAGE>

such Loans) to its unaffiliated lenders for collateral security purposes,
provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loans made by the Borrower
to or for the account of the assigning or pledging Lender in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's obligations hereunder in
respect to such assigned or pledged Loans to the extent of such payment. No such
assignment or pledge shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations
hereunder.

     (f) The Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrower, maintain at its address
referred to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to
it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and
the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as
the owner of the Commitments, Loans and any Notes evidencing such Loans recorded
therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Commitment
and/or Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon
appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any
assignment or transfer of all or part of a Commitment and/or Loan evidenced by a
Note shall be registered on the Register only upon a surrender or registration
of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a
duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; thereupon one or more new Notes in the
same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee and,
if applicable, assignor, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Agent to the
Borrower marked "cancelled". The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or any Lender (with respect to any entry relating to such Lender's
Commitments and Loans) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

     9.9 Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and the Lenders shall maintain in
confidence in accordance with its customary procedures for handling confidential
information, all written information that Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their authorized representatives, furnishes to the Agent or any Lender
("Confidential Information"), other than any such Confidential Information that
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach by
the Agent or any Lender of its obligations hereunder or that is or becomes
available to the Agent or such Lender from a source other than Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any of their authorized representatives, and that is
not, to the actual knowledge of the recipient thereof, subject to obligations of
confidentiality with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Agent and each
Lender shall in any event have the right to deliver copies of any such
documents, and to disclose any such information, to:

     (a) (i) its directors, officers, trustees, partners, employees, agents,
attorneys, and professional consultants who are informed of the confidential
nature thereof and (ii) portfolio management services and rating agencies;

     (b) any other Lender and any successor Agent;

     (c) any Person to which such Lender offers to sell any Loan or any part
thereof or interest or participation therein (provided such Person agrees to
keep such information confidential on the terms set forth in this Section 9.9);

                                       60

<PAGE>

     (d) any federal or state regulatory authority or examiner, or any insurance
industry association, regulating or having jurisdiction over the Agent or such
Lender; and

     (e) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary
or appropriate (i) in compliance with any applicable law, rule, regulation or
order, (ii) in response to any subpoena or other legal process or informal
investigative demand (in which event Agent or such Lender agrees to provide
notice thereof to Borrower), (iii) in connection with any litigation to which
the Agent or such Lender is a party (in which event Agent or such Lender agrees
to provide notice thereof to Borrower), or (iv) in connection with the
enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Agent or the Lenders under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents at any time when an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing.

     The confidentiality provisions hereunder shall not apply to disclosures
consisting of general portfolio information that does not identify the Borrower.

     9.10 Set-off; Sharing of Payments. In addition to any rights and remedies
now or hereafter granted under applicable law, and not by way of limitation of
any such rights or remedies at any time and from time to time, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is
hereby authorized by the Borrower, with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to
the Borrower or to any other Person (any prior or contemporaneous notice being
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower) to set off and to appropriate and to
apply any and all

     (a) balances held by such Lender at any of its offices for the account of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such balances are
then due to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries); and

     (b) other Property at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the
credit or for the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

against and on account of any and all Obligations which are not paid when due;
except that no Lender shall exercise such right without prior notice to the
Agent. Any Lender having a right to set off shall purchase for cash (and the
other Lenders shall sell) participations in each such other Lender's pro rata
share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to share the
benefit of such right of set-off with each other Lender in accordance with their
respective pro rata shares of the Obligations. The Borrower agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any Lender may exercise its right to
set off with respect to amounts in excess of its pro rata share of the
Obligations and may sell participations to other Lenders, and (ii) any Lender so
purchasing a participation in the Obligations held by other Lenders may exercise
all rights of setoff, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of
Obligations in the amount of such participation. The Borrower hereby grants to
each Lender a security interest in all such deposits and other Property, whether
now existing or hereafter arising, held by each Lender for the purposes set
forth herein.

     9.11 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each Lender shall
notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to
such Lender should be directed, of addresses of its Lending Office, of payment
instructions in respect of all payments to

                                       61

set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged
with each of the Borrower and the Agent.

     9.13 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of

except as expressly stated to the contrary in this Agreement.

and has been reviewed by counsel to, the Agent, the Borrower and other parties
hereto, and is the product of all parties hereto. Accordingly, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents shall not be construed against the Lenders or the

for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders and the
Agent, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be
a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause
of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to any
Person not a party to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

     9.18 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

          (A) THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS AND DECISIONS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,

                                       63

Agreement by the Borrower constitutes a full, complete and irrevocable release
of any and all claims which the Borrower may have at law or in equity in respect
of all prior discussions and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Neither Agent nor
any Lender shall be liable to Borrower or any other Person on any theory of
liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages.

               ARTICLE X - TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     10.1 Taxes.

     (a) Subject to subsection 10.1(g), any and all payments by the Borrower to
each Lender or the Agent under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of,
and without deduction or withholding for, any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, such taxes
(including income taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by
each Lender's net income by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender
or the Agent, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office or
any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes").

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or Property taxes, charges or similar
levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (c) Subject to subsection 10.1(g), the Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Lender and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 10.1) paid by such Lender or the Agent and any
liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made
within thirty (30) days from the date any Lender or the Agent makes written
demand therefor.

     (d) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any
Lender or the Agent, then, subject to subsection 10.1(g):

               (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
          making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
          additional sums payable under this Section 10.1) such Lender or the
          Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it
          would have received had no such deductions been made;

               (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions; and

                                       64

<PAGE>

               (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
          relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
          applicable law.

     (e) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment by the Borrower
of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original or
a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Agent.

     (f) Each Lender that is not a citizen or resident of the United States of
America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States (or any jurisdiction thereof), or any estate
or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of
its income (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two
copies of each U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any
subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or, in the case of a Non-U.S.
Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h)
or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form
W-8, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such
Non-U.S. Lender delivers a Form W-8, a certificate representing that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is
not a ten percent (10%) shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B)
of the Code) of Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to
Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly
completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption
from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by
Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be
delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to
this Agreement. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms
promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by
such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at
any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any
previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of
certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a Non-U.S. Lender shall
not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this subsection that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

     (g) The Borrower will not be required to pay any additional amounts in
respect of United States federal income tax pursuant to subsection 10.1(d) to
any Lender for the account of any Lending Office of such Lender:

               (i) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not
          have arisen but for a failure by such Lender to comply with its
          obligations under subsection 10.1(f) in respect of such Lending
          Office;

               (ii) if such Lender shall have delivered to the Borrower a Form
          W-8BEN and/or Form W-8ECI (or any subsequent versions thereof or
          successors thereto) in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to
          subsection 10.1(f), and such Lender shall not at any time be entitled
          to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States federal
          income tax in respect of payments by the Borrower hereunder for the
          account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in
          United States law, treaty or regulations or in the official
          interpretation of such law or regulations by any Governmental
          Authority charged

                                       65

<PAGE>

          with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not
          having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form
          W-8BEN and/or Form W-8ECI (or any subsequent versions thereof or
          successors thereto); or

               (iii) if such Lender shall have delivered to the Borrower a Form
          W-8 (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) in
          respect of such Lending Office pursuant to subsection 10.1(f), and
          such Lender shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from
          deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax in
          respect of payments by the Borrower hereunder for the account of such
          Lending Office for any reason other than a change in the United States
          law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in
          the official interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by
          any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
          administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after
          the date of delivery of such Form W-8 (or subsequent versions thereof
          or successors thereto).

     (h) If, at any time, the Borrower requests any Lender to deliver any forms
or other documentation pursuant to subsection 10.1(f), then the Borrower shall,
on demand of such Lender through the Agent, reimburse such Lender for any costs
and expenses (including Attorney Costs) reasonably incurred by such Lender in
the preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation.

     (i) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to any Lender or
the Agent pursuant to subsection 10.1(d), then such Lender shall use its
reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such
additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter accrue if such change in
the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     10.2 Illegality. (a) (a) If after the date hereof any Lender shall
determine that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or administration thereof by the
applicable Governmental Authority, has made it unlawful, or that any central
bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any
Lender or its Lending Office to make LIBOR Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof
by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, the obligation of that Lender
to make LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender shall have
notified the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exists.

     (b) Subject to clause (c) below, if any Lender shall determine that it is
unlawful to maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall prepay in full all
LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued
thereon, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if such Lender
may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR
Rate Loans, together with any amounts required to be paid in connection
therewith pursuant to Section 10.4.

     (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans
has been terminated, the Borrower may elect, by giving notice to such Lender
through the Agent that all

                                       66

<PAGE>

Loans which would otherwise be made by any such Lender as LIBOR Rate Loans shall
be instead Base Rate Loans.

     (d) Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section 10.2,
the affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to
its LIBOR Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Lender, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.

     10.3 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.

     (a) If any Lender shall determine that, due to either (i) the introduction
of, or any change in, or in the interpretation by the applicable Governmental
Authority of, any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law), in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) subsequent to
the date hereof, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loans, then
the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, within thirty
(30) days of demand therefor by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as
are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs; provided,
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
subsection for any increased costs incurred more than one hundred eighty (180)
days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the law, rule,
regulation, order, guideline, request or other legal requirement of any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law)
giving rise to such increased costs and of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if such law, rule, regulation,
order, guideline, request or other legal requirement giving rise to such
increased costs is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall
be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

     (b) If any Lender shall have determined that:

               (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation;

               (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation;

               (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any
          Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental
          Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof;
          or

               (iv) compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any
          corporation controlling the Lender, with any Capital Adequacy
          Regulation;

affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and (taking into consideration
such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy
and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such
capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitment(s), loans, credits or
obligations under this Agreement, then, within thirty (30) days of demand of
such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender,

                                       67

<PAGE>

from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increase; provided, that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this subsection for any such
increase incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that
such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Capital Adequacy Regulation giving rise
to such increase and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further that, if such Capital Adequacy Regulation giving rise to such
increase is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

     10.4 Funding Losses. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any loss (but excluding loss of profit) or
expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of:

     (a) the failure of the Borrower to make any payment or mandatory prepayment
of principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan when due (including payments made after any
acceleration thereof);

     (b) the failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after
the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation;

     (c) the failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment after the Borrower
has given a notice in accordance with Section 1.7;

     (d) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 1.8) by Borrower or any
Subsidiary of Borrower of a LIBOR Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day
of the Interest Period with respect thereto; or

     (e) the conversion pursuant to Section 1.6 of any LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base
Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained (but
excluding loss of profit). Solely for purposes of calculating amounts payable by
the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 10.4 and under subsection
10.3(a): each LIBOR Rate Loan made by a Lender (and each related reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have
been funded at the LIBOR used in determining the interest rate for such LIBOR
Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar
market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
LIBOR Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

     10.5 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Agent shall have determined in
good faith that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or that the LIBOR applicable pursuant to subsection
1.3(a) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate
Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
such Loan, the Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the
Borrower

                                       68

<PAGE>

and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent revokes such
notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion then submitted by it.
If the Borrower does not revoke such notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or
continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the
applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made,
converted or continued as Base Rate Loans.

     10.6 Reserves on LIBOR Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender,
as long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Federal
Reserve Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional costs on the unpaid principal amount of
each LIBOR Rate Loan equal to actual costs of such reserves allocated to such
Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Loan provided the Borrower shall have
received at least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice (with a copy to the
Agent) of such additional interest from the Lender. If a Lender fails to give
notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such
additional interest shall be payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such
notice.

     10.7 Certificates of Lenders. Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
compensation pursuant to this Article X shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount
payable to such Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.

     10.8 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in this
Article X shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

     10.9 Replacement of Lender in Respect of Increased Costs. Within forty-five
(45) days after receipt by the Borrower of written notice and demand from any
Lender (an "Affected Lender") for payment of additional costs as provided in
Sections 10.1, 10.3 and 10.6, the Borrower may, at its option, notify the Agent
and such Affected Lender of the Borrower's intention to obtain, at the
Borrower's expense, a replacement Lender ("Replacement Lender") for such
Affected Lender, which Replacement Lender shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Agent. In the event the Borrower obtains a Replacement Lender within ninety
(90) days following notice of its intention to do so, the Affected Lender shall
sell and assign its Loans and Commitments to such Replacement Lender, provided
that the Borrower has reimbursed such Affected Lender for its increased costs
for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this Agreement through the date
of such sale and assignment.

     10.10 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 10.1(c) or
Section 10.3 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower,
use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender)
to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with
the object of avoiding or minimizing the consequences of such event; provided,
that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such
Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal
or regulatory disadvantage, and

                                       69

<PAGE>

provided, further, that nothing in this Section 10.10 shall affect or postpone
any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
