2.    NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS

      (a)    For so long as this Agreement remains in force  and subject as set

             (i)   Northern Rock will be entitled to, and shall,  nominate  one
                   person willing to serve in the capacity of director for each
                   SPV  Company  (and  Northern Rock shall be deemed to have so
                   nominated Keith McCallum Currie as its first nominee in such
                   capacity) and nothing  herein shall require Northern Rock to
                   nominate the same person  as  director for each SPV Company;
                   and

             (ii)  the  Current  Issuer  Corporate Services  Provider  will  be
                   entitled to, and shall,  nominate  two  persons  willing  to
                   serve  in the capacity of director for each SPV Company (and

                   Director No. 1 Limited  and  L.D.C.  Securitisation Director
                   No. 2 Limited as its first nominees in  such  capacity)  and
                   nothing  herein  shall  prevent the Current Issuer Corporate
                   Services  Provider from nominating  itself  as  a  corporate
                   director for  each SPV Company or require the Current Issuer
                   Corporate Services Provider to nominate the same two persons
                   as director for each SPV Company.

      (b)    In relation to any person  nominated  or  deemed  to  be nominated
             under (a) above, whichever of Northern Rock or the Current  Issuer
             Corporate  Services Provider nominated that person is referred  to
             below as that person's "appointor".

      (c)    In relation  to  any  person  nominated  or deemed to be nominated
             under (a) above as a director of any SPV Company,  that  person is
             referred to below as a "Director".

      (d)    Each  appointor  hereby  confirms to the other that, if the person
             nominated or deemed to be  nominated by it should resign or retire
             or for any other reason cease  to  act  as  Director  of  any  SPV
             Company, it will promptly:

             (i)   procure that such Director shall acknowledge in writing that
                   he  has  no  claim  of any nature whatsoever against the SPV
                   Companies;

             (ii)  nominate another person  willing  to  act  in  the  relevant
                   capacity; and

             (iii) procure  the  consent  of  that  other person to act in that
                   capacity.

      (e)    Each appointor shall procure that each of the persons respectively
             nominated or deemed to be nominated by it  from  time  to  time as
             provided  above  accepts the relevant appointment and acts in  the
             relevant capacity without fee or remuneration from any SPV Company
             save that nothing  in  this Agreement shall prejudice any right to
             remuneration on the part  of the Current Issuer Corporate Services
             Provider under Clause 6 hereof.

      (f)    The Share Trustee undertakes  and agrees subject to its duties and
             obligations as Share Trustee under  the  Share Trust Deed dated 19
             March 2001 that it shall exercise its rights  as  a shareholder of

             Northern Rock shall have nominated such person to such office) and

             obligations of the  Current Issuer Corporate Services Provider and

             obligation or claim arising out of or based upon this Agreement or
             any of the Transaction Documents against any employee,  officer or
             director of the Current Issuer Corporate Services Provider  or the
             SPV  Companies  save  where  the claim, demand, liability, cost or
             expense in connection therewith arises from the negligence, wilful
             default or breach of duty of such employee, officer or director of
             the  Current  Issuer  Corporate  Services   Provider  or  the  SPV

      Directors or the Share Trustee.  This indemnity  shall  continue in force
      notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.
