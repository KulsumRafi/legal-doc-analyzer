<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Lyn: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>As
you are aware, Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded the credit ratings of the PG&amp;E National Energy Group (the "Company") and two of its subsidiaries to below
investment grade. While disappointing, these downgrades are in keeping with the rating agencies' larger overall review of the energy sector. In response to the downgrades and the challenging market
conditions affecting our sector of the energy industry, the Company has embarked upon a major cost reduction effort with the goal of achieving a reduction of at least $40&nbsp;million in annual
operating expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
order to encourage you to continue your contribution to the success of the Company amidst these challenging and disruptive business conditions, you are being provided with a retention award subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this letter (the "Letter") and the PG&amp;E National Energy Group Management Retention Program (the "Program"). </FONT></P>
