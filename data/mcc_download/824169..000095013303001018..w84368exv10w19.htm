2002/2003 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">This document sets forth the terms of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;)
of Nextel Communications, Inc. (the &#147;Company).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>1. Overview and Effective Date</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Plan is intended to reward key members of the Company&#146;s management for
achieving specific performance goals over a two-year period commencing January
1, 2002. The Plan offers Participants (as defined below) the opportunity to
receive a cash-based payment, or a combination of cash and stock-based payments
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board
of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;), if the Company achieves certain objectives that are
deemed critical to the long-term success of the Company.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Plan is effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2002 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and was
authorized by the Committee on May&nbsp;30, 2002 (the &#147;Approval Date&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2. Plan Administration</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Plan, as it pertains to members of senior management as so determined by
the Committee and/or Board, shall be administered by the Committee and/or the
Board. The Committee&#146;s and/or the Board&#146;s powers and authority include, but
are not limited to (1)&nbsp;selecting individuals who are eligible to participate
(&#147;Participants&#148;), (2)&nbsp;determining target award opportunities for Participants,
(3)&nbsp;interpreting the Plan&#146;s provisions, (4)&nbsp;approving final payments under the
Plan, and (5)&nbsp;administering the Plan in a manner that is consistent with its
purpose.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall have the powers and authority
described in clause (1)&nbsp;and (2)&nbsp;above with respect to Participants below the
senior management level, as designated by the Committee and/or Board and in
accordance with the parameters established by the Committee and/or the Board.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The Committee and/or the Board may delegate certain administrative functions to
management, such as maintenance of Participant lists, periodic communication
with regard to performance against targets over time, and other functions as
determined by the Committee and/or the Board.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>3. Performance Period</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Performance will be measured over the two-year period from January&nbsp;1, 2002 to
December&nbsp;31, 2003 (the &#147;Performance Period&#148;). A special &#147;Interim Payout&#148; (see
Section&nbsp;7 below) may occur based on performance with respect to the one-year
period from January&nbsp;1, 2002 to December&nbsp;31, 2002 (&#147;Interim Performance
Period&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">There is no formal obligation or intent on the part of the Company or Committee

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Key members of the Company&#146;s management team responsible for the design and
execution of the Company&#146;s business strategy are eligible to participate in the
Plan. Participants who are members of senior management are recommended by the
Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Committee and/or Board.
Participants below the senior management level are recommended by members of
senior management and approved by the Chief Executive Officer in accordance
with the parameters established by the Committee and/or the Board.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Participants may be added after the Approval Date of the Plan as recommended by
the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Committee and/or Board with
respect to members of senior management, and as recommended by senior
management and approved by the Chief Executive Officer with respect to
Participants below the senior management level in accordance with the
parameters established by the Committee and/or the Board.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Participants will receive a personalized letter from the Company indicating
their participation in the Plan and the Target Award Opportunity as set forth
in Section&nbsp;5.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>5. Target Award Opportunity</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Each Participant will be assigned a &#147;Target Award Opportunity&#148; expressed as a
dollar amount at the beginning of the Performance Period. The Target Award
Opportunity will not be subject to adjustment during the Performance Period,
except in such circumstances determined by the Committee and/or the Board that
warrant such adjustment.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Both the Target Award Opportunity and any adjustment to the Target Award
Opportunity during the Performance Period will be determined by the Chief
Executive Officer and approved by the Committee and/or Board with respect to
members of senior management, and determined by members of senior management
and approved by the Chief Executive Officer for Participants below the senior
management level in accordance with the parameters established by the Committee
and/or the Board.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The amount of actual payment may be higher or lower than the Target Award
Opportunity based on actual performance versus the goals set forth for the
Performance Period.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">OCF is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and any charges or income determined to be non-recurring or non-operational or
extraordinary in nature, such as restructuring and impairment charges, as
determined by the Committee and/or the Board. The OCF target, which excludes
such items that are deemed non-recurring or non-operational in nature, will be
determined by the Committee and/or Board for the Performance Period and the
Interim Performance Period. Based on this goal and actual OCF achievement
during the Performance Period, the following payout schedule will apply.
Linear interpolation will be used to calculate the payout for performance
between the points shown below.
