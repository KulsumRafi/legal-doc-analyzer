purposes of determining the Applicable Margins or the Facility Fee Rates, (i)&nbsp;in the event of a "split rating" (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, if the
Moody's Rating applicable to the Borrower at any time appears in the chart above in a different column from that in which the S&amp;P Rating then applicable to the Borrower appears), the Applicable
Margins and the Facility Fee Rates will be based on the column which includes the higher rating (unless the higher rating is more than one rating level higher than the lower rating, in which case the
pricing shall be that applicable to the rating level which is one rating level lower than the higher rating level), (ii)&nbsp;if Moody's or S&amp;P shall not have in effect a rating (other than because
such rating agency shall no longer be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations), then such rating agency will be deemed to have established a rating one rating level lower than the rating
of either Moody's or S&amp;P, as the case may be, that remains in effect and (iii)&nbsp;the Applicable Margins and the Facility Fee Rates shall be subject to adjustment (upwards or downwards, as
appropriate), effective as of the date on which S&amp;P or Moody's announces a rating change which results in a change in the Applicable Margins and the Facility Fee Rates. </FONT></P>
