          sell or liquidate any of the foregoing investments at any time if

          Assets shall be allocable among the parties as set forth in
          Section 13 hereof. 8. Claims Against the Trust Assets. The Trust

          damage, disbursement, expense, fine, fee, liability, loss,
          deficiency, obligation, penalty or settlement of any nature,
          including but not limited to, interest or other carrying costs,
          penalties, legal, accounting and other professional fees and
          expenses incurred in the investigation, collection, prosecution
          and defense of claims, whether in litigation or other proceedings
          or with respect to any action, and amounts paid in settlement
          that may be imposed on or otherwise incurred or suffered,
          directly or indirectly, by any of Settlor, its subsidiaries or
          any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
          representatives and that arise in connection with any breach of,
          or inaccuracy in, any of the representations, warranties or
          covenants made by Settlor, or made or confirmed by the Accepting
          Shareholders, in the Share Subscription Agreement or Tender Offer
          Documents (a "LOSS").

          8.1  Claim for Loss

          (a)  If at any time prior to the Final Termination Date (as
               defined below), Settlor determines that any of Settlor, its
               subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
               employees, agents or representatives has suffered a Loss, or
               is reasonably likely to suffer a Loss, Settlor shall deliver
               to Representative a notice summarizing in reasonable detail
               the nature and amount of the Loss. If the amount of a Loss
               is not yet certain on the date of such notice, Settlor shall
               provide a good faith estimate of the maximum Loss likely to
               be incurred. The Loss specified or estimated in such notice
               shall be referred to herein as the "Owed Amount".

          (b)  Concurrently with the delivery of any notice by Settlor to
               the Representative of a Loss pursuant to Section 8.1(a)
               above, Settlor will deliver to the Trustee a certificate in
               substantially the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (a
               "CERTIFICATE OF INSTRUCTION"). The Trustee shall give
               written notice to the Representative of its receipt of a
               Certificate of Instruction not later than two business days
               following receipt thereof, together with a copy of such
               Certificate of Instruction.


                                     4


<PAGE>


          (c)  If Representative objects to any claim of Settlor reflected
               in a Certificate of Instruction, Representative shall notify
               Settlor, and Settlor and Representative shall promptly
               review the claim together and attempt to address
               Representative's objections. If, within 15 days following
               Settlor's delivery of the Certificate of Instruction to the
               Trustee (the "CONCILIATION PERIOD"), Settlor and
               Representative agree that Settlor's claim as reflected in
               the Certificate of Instruction should be modified, Settlor
               and Representative shall execute jointly and deliver to the
               Trustee a Resolution Certificate in substantially the form
               attached as Exhibit C.

          (d)  If, within the Conciliation Period, the Trustee receives a
               Resolution Certificate signed by both Settlor and
               Representative, it shall promptly pay over to Settlor from
               the Trust Assets, by wire transfer of immediately available
               funds to a bank account of Settlor's designation, the Owed
               Amount set forth in the Resolution Certificate. If Trustee
               does not receive a Resolution Certificate signed by both
               Settlor and Representative before expiration of the
               Conciliation Period, the Trustee shall, notwithstanding any
               objection by Representative or any other party, promptly
               upon expiration of the Conciliation Period pay over to
               Settlor from the Trust Assets, by wire transfer of
               immediately available funds to a bank account of Settlor's
               designation, the Owed Amount set forth in the Certificate of
               Instruction from the Trust Assets. Such obligation of the
               Trustee shall be absolute and unconditional.

          (e)  If the Representative should dispute or object to the Loss
               claimed by Settlor in the notice to Representative given
               pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or in the Certificate of
               Instruction, and Settlor has not agreed during the
               Conciliation Period to modify its claim by executing a
               Resolution Certificate, Representative shall have no right
               to object to or prevent the disbursement of funds to Settlor
               by the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.1(d). The
               Representative's sole recourse shall be to commence an
               arbitration action against Settlor pursuant to Section 29
               hereof to reclaim the amounts paid over to Settlor by
               Trustee pursuant to the Certificate of Instruction. If,
               following any disbursement from the Trust Assets to Settlor
               pursuant to this Section 8.1, the actual amount of an
               estimated Loss is finally determined by Settlor to be less
               than the Owed Amount specified with respect to such Loss and
               paid to Settlor, Settlor shall within ten (10) business days
               remit to Representative the amount by which the Owed Amount
               exceeded such actual Loss plus interest at a rate equal to
               the annual rate of return of the Trust Assets for the period
               of time during which Settlor held the excess funds or, for
               any period of time after the Trust Assets have been fully
               disbursed, a rate of five percent (5%) per annum.

          8.2  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8 to the contrary,
               (i) the Trustee shall not be required to make any payments
               to Settlor for any Loss if all amounts in the Trust Assets
               have been released or otherwise previously distributed and
               (ii) Settlor shall have no right to claim a Loss hereunder
               prior to the earlier of (A) the date of the closing of the
               OPA and (B) December 31, 2002.

9.   Release of Trust Assets.

     (a)  Promptly after the expiration of the relevant acceptance period
          of the OPA as set forth in the Tender Offer Documents (the
          "ACCEPTANCE TERMINATION DATE"), the Trustee will release and pay
          to Settlor by wire transfer in immediately available funds (or
          through such alternative method as Settlor may instruct the
          Trustee), the balance of the Trust Assets not to be retained on
          behalf of the Accepting Shareholders.

     (b)  Fifty-three and one-third percent (53.33%) of the Trust Assets
          will be held by the Trustee for the recovery of Losses until the
          date which is thirty-six (36) months after the earlier of (A) the
          date of the closing of the OPA and (B) December 31, 2002 and (ii)
          forty-six and two-thirds percent (46.67%) of the Trust Assets
          will be held by the Trustee for the recovery of Losses until the
          date on which the lawsuit filed by Refrescos Nacionales, S.A.
          against Coca Cola and its subsidiaries Ventas y Mercadeo, S.A.
          and Direccion y Administracion de Empresas, S.A. for alleged
          antitrust practices is settled or is the subject of a final,
          non-appealable judgment (the earlier of the dates described in
          clauses (i) and (ii) shall be referred to herein as the "INITIAL
          TERMINATION DATE" and the later of such dates, the "FINAL
          TERMINATION DATE"); provided, however, that such lawsuit shall
          not be settled without the consent of the Representative, such
          consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and any dispute relating
          to the granting or withholding of such consent shall be governed
          by Section 29 hereof; provided further, if any claims for Losses
          are pending as of the Initial Termination Date or the Final
          Termination Date, as the case may be, then such date shall be
          extended to such time as all such claims have been fully
          satisfied or otherwise disposed.

10.  Termination.

     (a)  Subject to Section 10(b), this Trust Agreement, and all
          obligations of the Trustee hereunder shall terminate on the
          earliest of: (i) the Final Termination Date, (ii) such earlier
          date on which all of the Trust Assets shall have been disbursed
          in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement, or (iii)
          the date on which CAB and Representative jointly notify the
          Trustee in writing of their intent to terminate the Trust
          Agreement, subject to the Trustee's consent (such consent not to
          be unreasonably withheld). In connection with termination of this
          Trust Agreement in accordance with this Section 10(a), upon
          payment of all Fees due to the Trustee, the Trust Assets then
          held hereunder shall be distributed pro rata for the benefit of
          the Accepting Shareholders, based upon the amount of shares
          tendered by each such Accepting Shareholder in the acceptance of
          the OPA. For that purpose, Banco General, S.A. or another
          qualified financial institution appointed by Settlor to serve as
          the paying agent of the OPA (the "PAYING AGENT") shall certify
          (the "PAYING AGENT CERTIFICATION") to the Trustee the number of
          shares that each such Accepting Shareholder has tendered and sold
          and the aggregate amount to be paid to each such Accepting
          Shareholder (the "CERTIFIED AMOUNT") pursuant to the Tender Offer
          Documents. Promptly after


                                     6

          the Acceptance Termination Date and receipt of the Paying Agent
          Certification, the Trustee shall deliver the Certified Amount to
          the Paying Agent.

     (b)  If Settlor exercises its rights of rescission under Section
          5.9(a) of the Share Subscription Agreement, then (a) Settlor (if
          such exercise shall occur during the Unconditional Period (as
          defined in the Share Subscription Agreement)) or Settlor and
          Representative jointly (if such exercise shall not occur during
          the Unconditional Period) shall send notice of such exercise to
          the Trustee in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 or Exhibit D-2
          hereto, as the case may be, (b) the Trustee shall deliver to
          Settlor all of the Trust Assets (net of Fees due to the Trustee)
          by wire transfer in immediately available funds and (c) this
          Trust Agreement and all obligations of the Trustee hereunder
          shall terminate

11.  Duties and Obligations of the Trustee. The duties and obligations of
     the Trustee shall be limited to and determined solely by the
     provisions of this Trust Agreement and the certificates delivered in
     accordance herewith, and the Trustee is not charged with knowledge of
     or any duties or responsibilities in respect of any other agreement or
     document. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:

     (a)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss of interest or
          earnings sustained as a result of investments made hereunder in
          accordance with the terms hereof, including any liquidation of
          any investment of the Trust Assets prior to its maturity effected
          in order to make a payment required by the terms of this Trust
          Agreement;

     (b)  The Trustee shall be fully protected in relying in good faith
          upon any written certification, instruction, notice, direction,
          request, waiver, consent, receipt or other document that the
          Trustee reasonably believes to be genuine and duly authorized,
          executed and delivered;

     (c)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for
          any act done or omitted by it, or for any mistake in fact or law,
          or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing in
          connection herewith; provided, however, that notwithstanding any
          other provision in this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall be
          liable for its willful misconduct or gross negligence;

     (d)  The Trustee may seek the advice of legal counsel selected with
          reasonable care (provided that the selection of such legal
          counsel shall require Settlor's prior written consent, such
          consent not to be unreasonably withheld) in the event of any
          dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
          provisions of this Trust Agreement or its duties hereunder, and
          it shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in
          respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good
          faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel;

     (e)  In the event that the Trustee shall in any instance, after
          seeking the advice of legal counsel pursuant to the immediately
          preceding clause, in good faith be uncertain as to its duties or
          rights hereunder, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any


                                     7


<PAGE>


          action in that instance and its sole obligation, in addition to
          those of its duties hereunder as to which there is no such
          uncertainty, shall be to keep the property affected by such
          uncertainty safely held in trust until it shall be directed
          otherwise in writing by Settlor and the Representative; provided,
          however, in the event that the Trustee has not received such
          written direction within thirty (30) days after requesting the
          same, it shall have the right to submit the issue to arbitration
          in accordance with Section 29 hereof; and

     (f)  The Trustee may execute any of its powers or responsibilities
          hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder either directly or by
          or through agents or attorneys selected with reasonable care.
          Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose upon
          the Trustee any duty to qualify to do business or to act as
          fiduciary or otherwise in any jurisdiction other than the
          Republic of Panama and the Trustee shall not be responsible for
          and shall not be under a duty to examine into or pass upon the
          validity, binding effect, execution or sufficiency of this Trust
          Agreement or of any agreement amendatory or supplemental hereto.

     (g)  The Trustee shall issue, or shall cause a financial institution
          (including Banco General, S.A.) to issue, a letter or a bank
          guarantee confirming the availability of sufficient funds to
          settle the obligations derived from the OPA, as required by
          applicable securities legislation of the Republic of Panama.

12.  Cooperation. Settlor and Representative shall provide to the Trustee
     all instruments and documents within their respective powers to
     provide that are necessary for the Trustee to perform its duties and
     responsibilities hereunder.

13.  Fees and Expenses; Indemnity.

     (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, the
          Trustee is authorized to deduct from earnings on the Trust Amount
          an acceptance fee of $10,000, and an annual fee of $15,000, both
          payable upon execution of this Trust Agreement. The annual fee
          will be payable thereafter on each anniversary of the execution
          of this Trust Agreement. The Trustee will charge a fee of $4 per
          check for payments to the Beneficiaries (as set forth in Section
          3 hereof) and Settlor upon liquidation of the Trust. The Trustee
          also shall be entitled to receive reasonable and customary
          out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
          performance of its duties hereunder. The fees, costs and expenses
          described in this Section 13(a) shall be referred to herein as
          "FEES".

     (b)  The Trustee is authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the
          earnings on the Trust Amount, from time to time, the amount of
          any Fees due and payable to it hereunder. If for any reason such
          earnings are insufficient to cover such Fees, Settlor shall pay
          within the following thirty (30) days such amounts to make up
          such shortfall to Trustee upon the presentation of an itemized
          invoice. The Trustee shall notify Settlor and Representative of
          any disbursement from the Trust Assets to itself in respect of
          any Fees under any provision of this Trust Agreement


                                     8


<PAGE>


          and shall furnish to Settlor and Representative copies of all
          related invoices and other statements.

     (c)  Prior to the consummation or termination of the OPA, Settlor
          shall be liable for and shall reimburse and indemnify Trustee
          (and any predecessor Trustee) and hold Trustee harmless from and
          against one-half (1/2) of any and all claims, losses, actions,
          liabilities, costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable
          attorneys' fees and expenses) arising from or in connection with
          Trustee's administration of, or performance of duties and
          obligations pursuant to, this Trust Agreement; provided, however,
          that notwithstanding the foregoing, Settlor shall not be required
          to indemnify the Trustee for any such claims, losses, actions,
          liabilities, costs, damages or expenses caused by its own gross
          negligence or own willful misconduct. In addition, when the
          Trustee acts on any information, instructions or communications
          (including, but not limited to, communications with respect to
          the delivery of securities or the wire transfer of funds) sent by
          telephone, telex or facsimile, the Trustee, absent gross
          negligence or willful misconduct, shall not be responsible or
          liable in the event such communication is not an authorized or
          authentic communication or is not in the form Settlor sent or
          intended to send (whether due to fraud, distortion or otherwise).
          The Trustee shall have the right to offset an amount equal to
          one-half (1/2) of any indemnifiable claims, losses, actions,
          liabilities, costs, damages or expenses described above against
          the Trust Assets.

     (d)  After consummation or termination of the OPA, Settlor shall be
          liable for one hundred percent (100%) of all indemnifiable
          claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses
          described in Section 13(c) above and the Trustee will have no
          right to offset any amount thereof against the Trust Assets.

     (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, all
          of Settlor's compensation, reimbursement and indemnification
          obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall be payable by
          Settlor upon demand by the Trustee, and the failure of Settlor to
          fund such obligations shall give rise to the right of the Trustee
          to offset any such unpaid amounts against payments otherwise due
          to Settlor pursuant to this Trust Agreement. The obligations of
          Settlor under this Section 13 shall survive any termination of
          this Trust Agreement and the resignation or removal of Trustee.

14.  Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

     (a)  The Trustee may resign as such thirty (30) calendar days
          following the giving of written notice thereof to Settlor and
          Representative. In addition, the Trustee may be removed and
          replaced on a date designated in a written instrument signed by
          Settlor and Representative and delivered to the Trustee. In the
          case of either such resignation or removal, Settlor and the
          Representative jointly shall appoint a branch or affiliate
          located in the Republic of Panama of one of HSBC, BNP Paribas or
          Citibank, N.A. as the successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, no such resignation or removal shall be effective
          until a successor


                                     9


<PAGE>


          Trustee has acknowledged its appointment as such as provided in
          Section 14(c). In either event, upon the effective date of such
          resignation or removal, the Trustee shall deliver the property
          comprising the Trust Assets (net of any Fees due to the Trustee)
          to such successor Trustee, together with such records maintained
          by the Trustee in connection with its duties hereunder and other
          information with respect to the Trust Assets as such successor
          may reasonably request.

     (b)  If a successor Trustee shall not have acknowledged its
          appointment as such as provided in Section 14(c), in the case of
          a resignation, prior to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar
          days following the date of a notice of resignation or, in the
          case of a removal, on the date designated for the Trustee's
          removal, as the case may be, because Settlor and Representative
          are unable to agree on a successor Trustee, or for any other
          reason, the successor Trustee shall be appointed from the first
          of HSBC, BNP Paribas and Citibank, N.A. (in such order) to
          acknowledge its appointment as such, and such appointment shall
          be binding upon all of the parties to this Trust Agreement.

     (c)  Upon written acknowledgment by a successor Trustee appointed in
          accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 of
          its agreement to serve as Trustee hereunder and the receipt of
          the property then comprising the Trust Assets, the Trustee shall
          be fully released and relieved of all duties, responsibilities
          and obligations under this Trust Agreement, subject to the
          provision contained in Section 11(c) and such successor Trustee
          shall for all purposes hereof be the Trustee.

     for bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or protection from creditors
     (collectively, the "BANKRUPTCY LAWS"), a petition in bankruptcy or

     or trustee of all or a portion of the assets of Settlor, Settlor will
     be deemed to have waived, and therefore will not assert, any and all

<PAGE>


     selected by Representative and the remaining arbitrator to be mutually

     tribunal. Any party shall be entitled to seek interim measures of
     protection in the form of pre-award attachment of assets or injunctive
     relief. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a
     sufficient remedy for any breach of this Trust Agreement and that the
     parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and

     and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the

     this Trust Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies
     available at law or equity to Settlor. At any hearing of oral
     evidence, each party shall have the right to present and examine its
     witnesses and to cross-examine the witnesses of the other party and
     each party shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery of the
     other party.

30.  Language. This Trust Agreement has been negotiated and executed in
     English. The parties acknowledge that a translation into Spanish may
     be required for purposes of filings with governmental authorities; in
     such case, the parties shall agree on Spanish translation by
     initialing the same. The parties agree that, in case of conflict
     between the English and Spanish translations of this Trust Agreement,
     the English version shall govern.

31.  No Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
     contrary, this Trust Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
     person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
