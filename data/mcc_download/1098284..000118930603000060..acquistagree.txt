                              Acquisition Agreement

This Acquisition Agreement, dated as of January 17, 2003, , is by and between
MetaSource Group, a Nevada company, hereinafter called "MSGR"; and the Acquired
Company's stockholders, hereinafter called the "Stockholders", as listed in
Appendix A.

1.     Acquisition
       All Agency Fish Ltd, company number 4022849, (the Acquired Company),
       shares shall be acquired by MSGR in exchange solely for an amount of
       common stock of MSGR (the "Exchange Shares") as hereinafter defined. As
       of the Closing Date, hereinafter defined in Article 5, the Exchange
       Shares will be issued to the Stockholders on a pro rata basis of share
       ownership of the Acquired Company.
         MSGR, the Acquired Company and the Stockholders agree that all of the
       Exchange Shares shall be exchanged for the Acquired Company shares based
       on the following formula: the average of 5 times Acquired Company net
       earnings for the trailing twelve months (defined hereafter) and 5 times
       Acquired Company net earnings for the forward twelve months (defined
       hereafter), where Acquired Company net earnings for the trailing twelve
       months are determined in Schedule A attached to this agreement and
       Acquired Company net earnings for the forward twelve months are
       calculated in a method acceptable to the MSGR auditor and which do not
       expense the repayment of principal to debtholders as listed on schedule B
       attached to this agreement, based on the average trading price (defined
       hereinafter) of MSGR common stock on the dates beginning December 4, 2002
       and ending December 31, 2002. Trailing twelve months shall be defined as
       twelve calendar months prior to the date of this acquisition agreement.
       Forward twelve months shall be defined as twelve calendar months
       following the date of this acquisition agreement. The average trading
       price of MSGR shares will be calculated as the average of high and low
       prices as reported on finance.yahoo.com. All Exchange Shares will be held
       in escrow by MSGR for a period of one year from the Closing Date. Within
       60 days following the forward twelve months, additional shares will be
       added according to the formula above if Acquired Company net earnings for
       the forward twelve months are greater than the Acquired Company earnings
       for the trailing twelve months. If Acquired Company net earnings for the
       forward twelve months are less than Acquired Company earnings for the
       trailing twelve months, the appropriate Exchange Shares will be
       subtracted according to the formula above. The Exchange Shares held in
       escrow by MSGR will secure and indemnify MSGR against a breach of
       warranties detailed hereinafter in Article 3 of this Agreement. In the
       event of an alleged breach of the warranties detailed in Article 3,
       sections (d) and (g), MSGR will have the option (the Option) to declare




                                       1
<PAGE>






       null and void this Agreement no later than 90 days of the discovery of
       such alleged breach. If MSGR does not exercise the Option, and in the
       event of an alleged breach of the warranties detailed in Article 3, MSGR
       and the Stockholders will negotiate in a timely manner a reduction in the
       number of Exchange Shares which are to be issued to Stockholders as
       compensation to MSGR for such breach. In the event such negotiations do
       not produce an agreed upon reduction in the number of Exchange Shares,
       MSGR and the Stockholders agree to submit the dispute to the American
       Arbitration Association (AAA) no later than one year from the date the
       breach was discovered. Excluding any Exchange Shares used as loan
       collateral, at the end of one year from the Closing Date, the
       Stockholders will be fully vested in the Exchange Shares less any amount
       forfeited, disputed, agreed upon or resolved by the AAA for forfeiture
       due to alleged breach of warranties described in Article 3. Resolution of
       claims by the AAA will be binding on MSGR, the Acquired Company and the
       Stockholders.

2.     Delivery of Acquired Company Shares
       On the Closing Date, the Stockholders will deliver to MSGR certificates
       representing their Acquired Company shares duly endorsed with signatures
       guaranteed and with documentary stamps affixed at the Stockholders'
       expense so as to make MSGR the sole owner thereof, free and clear of all
       claims and encumbrances.
       Delivery will be made at 40 Exchange Place, Suite 1607, New York, NY
       10005.

3.     Representations of Stockholders and the Acquired Company
       The Stockholders warrant to MSGR as follows:
       a)     As of the Closing Date, the Stockholders will be the sole owners
              of the Acquired Company shares appearing of record in their names;
              such shares will be free from claims, liens or other encumbrances.
       b)     The Acquired Company shares will constitute validly issued shares
              of the Acquired Company which are fully paid and nonassessable.
       c)     As of the Closing Date, there will be 100 of the Acquired
              Company's stock issued and outstanding. There are no options,
              warrants, convertible or other securities, calls, commitments,
              conversion privileges, preemptive rights or other rights or
              agreements outstanding to purchase or otherwise acquire (whether
              directly or indirectly) any of the Acquired Company's share
              capital or any security convertible into or exchangeable for any
              shares of the Acquired Company's capital stock or obligating the
              Acquired Company to grant, issue, extend, or enter into, any such
              option, warrant, convertible or other security, call, commitment,
              conversion privilege, preemptive right or other right or agreement
              ("Interests"). The Company has no liability for any dividends
              accrued but unpaid. No Acquired Company shares are reserved for
              issuance under any stock purchase, stock option or other benefit
              plan.

       d)     The financial statements of the Acquired Company, as of October
              31, 2002, which are attached as Schedules (A), (B) and (C), show a

              usual course of business; and no such contracts or obligations in
              the usual course of business are liens or other liabilities which,
              if disclosed, would alter substantially the financial condition of
              the Acquired Company as reflected in such financial statements.
       e)     Since October 31, there have not been, and prior to the Closing
              Date there will not be, any material changes in the financial
              condition of the Acquired Company, except changes arising in the
              ordinary course of business.

                     use, sell or license all of its Intellectual Property

                     required for the conduct of its business as presently
                     conducted, and such rights to use, sell, or license are
                     sufficient for such conduct of its business;
              ii)    The Acquired Company is the legal and beneficial owner of
                     all its IP Rights;
              iii)   Any and all intellectual property held by the Acquired
                     Company is owned outright, free and clear of any claims,
                     liens, security interests, mortgages, encumbrances or
                     obligations by the Acquired Company;
              iv)    The Acquired Company is currently taking reasonable and
                     practicable steps designed to protect, preserve, and
                     maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of all material
                     Acquired Company IP Rights and all of Acquired Company's
                     proprietary rights therein;
              v)     All officers, employees, agents, and consultants of the
                     Acquired Company having access to proprietary information
                     agree not to disclose such information to any third
                     parties. IP Rights, as used herein, means, collectively,
                     all worldwide industrial and intellectual property rights,
                     including but not limited to patents, patent applications,

                     customer lists, proprietary processes and formulae,
                     manuals, memoranda and records.

       501(h) pursuant to the Securities Act, such knowledge and experience in
       financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits
       and risks of an investment in the MSGR's securities; (ii) is aware of the
       limits on resale of the Exchange Shares imposed because of the nature of
       the transactions contemplated herein, including, but not limited to,

       promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (iii) is
       receiving the Exchange Shares without registration pursuant to the
       Securities Act, in reliance on the exemption from registration specified
       in Regulation S promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for
       investment, and without any intent to sell, resell, or otherwise
       distribute the Exchange Shares in any manner that is in violation of the
       Securities Act. The certificates representing the Exchange Shares, when
       delivered to the Stockholders, may have appropriate orders restricting
       transfer placed against them on the records of the transfer agent for
       such securities, and may have placed upon them the following legend:
       THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES
       ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT

<PAGE>





       SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE (THE "RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION
       DATE") WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE
       HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE
       ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF SUCH
       SECURITY), ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
       STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C)
       PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WITHIN
       THE MEANING OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (D) TO AN
       INSTITUTIONAL "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 501(A)(1),
       (2), (3) OR (7) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT IS AN INSTITUTIONAL
       INVESTOR ACQUIRING THE SECURITY FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF
       SUCH AN INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTOR, FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND
       NOT WITH A VIEW TO OR FOR OFFER OR SALE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
       DISTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO
       ANOTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
       SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT TO THE SURVIVING CORPORATION'S RIGHTS PRIOR TO
       ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (C), (D) OR (E) TO
       REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER
       INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO THE SURVIVING CORPORATION AND IN THE CASE OF
       THE FOREGOING CLAUSE (D), A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER (A FORM OF WHICH MAY
       BE OBTAINED FROM THE SURVIVING CORPORATION) COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY
       THE TRANSFEROR TO THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS WITH
       REGARD TO THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED BY THE HOLDER HEREOF UNLESS
       IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS
       "OFFSHORE TRANSACTION", "UNITED STATES" AND "U.S. PERSON" HAVE THE
       MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

       Each Stockholder agrees not to attempt any transfer of any of the MSGR
       shares without first complying with the substance of that legend and
       agrees that the satisfaction of MSGR may, if MSGR so requests, depend in
       part upon an opinion of counsel acceptable in form and substance to MSGR,
       a no-action letter of the United States Securities and Exchange
       Commission, or equivalent evidence. Each of the Stockholders
       acknowledges, without limitation, that the foregoing agreement and
       representation shall apply to the MSGR shares issued to such
       Stockholders.
       All Exhange Shares will be subject to the Lockup provision, defined
       hereinafter as 50 percent of Exchange Shares available for registration
       one year from the date of this acquisition agreement and 50 percent of
       Exchange Shares available for registration two years from the date of
       this acquisition agreement.
