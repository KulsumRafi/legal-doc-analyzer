&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<I>Cause</I>&#148; shall
mean (i) the willful and continued failure by Executive substantially to perform his
reasonably assigned duties with ESI (consistent with those duties assigned to Executive
prior to any Change in Control), other than a failure resulting from Executive&#146;s
incapacity due to physical or mental illness or impairment, after a written demand for
performance has been delivered to Executive by the Chairman of the Board which
specifically identifies the manner in which the Chairman believes that Executive has not
substantially performed his duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by Executive in illegal
conduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to ESI. For purposes of this
subsection (a), no act, or failure to act, on Executive&#146;s part shall be considered
&#147;willful&#148; unless done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in knowing bad faith
and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of ESI. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to
a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the advise of counsel for ESI shall
be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith
and in the best interests of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive
shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have
been delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote
of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the
Board called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an
opportunity for Executive, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, Executive has engaged in the conduct
set forth above in (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (a) and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.  </FONT></P>

termination of Executive&#146;s employment under the provision so indicated (a &#147;<I>Notice
of Termination</I>&#148;). The effective date of any such termination of this Agreement shall
be: (i) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated for Disability, 30 days after a
Notice of Termination is given (provided that Executive shall not have returned to the
performance of Executive&#146;s duties on a full-time basis during such 30-day period),
(ii) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by ESI for Cause, the date on which the
Notice of Termination is given, and (iii) if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated by
Executive or by ESI for any other reason, the date specified in the Notice of
Termination, which shall be a date no earlier than 90 days after the date on which the
Notice of Termination is given, unless an earlier date has been agreed to by the party
receiving the Notice of Termination either in advance of, or after, receiving such Notice
of Termination. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if the party
receiving a Notice of Termination has not previously agreed to the termination, then
within 30 days after the Notice of Termination is given, the party receiving the Notice
of Termination may notify the other party that a dispute exists concerning the
termination, in which event the Date of Termination shall be the date set either by
mutual written agreement of the parties or by the arbitrators in a proceeding as provided
in Section 12(e). </FONT> </P>

agrees that damages for a breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants set forth

damages in connection therewith, may seek specific enforcement of any such covenant in
any court of competent jurisdiction, including without limitation, by the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction without the necessity of showing any actual damages or
posting any bond or furnishing any other security, and that the specific enforcement of
the provisions of this Agreement will not diminish Executive&#146;s ability to earn a
livelihood or create or impose upon Executive any undue hardship. Executive also agrees
that any request for such relief by ESI shall be in addition to, and without prejudice
to, any claim for monetary or other damages that ESI may elect to assert.  </FONT></P>

Scientific Industries, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), considers
the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to
protecting and enhancing the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. In this
connection, the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held
corporations, the possibility of a change in control may exist and that such possibility,
and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the
departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
shareholders. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;)
has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the
continued attention and dedication of members of the Company&#146;s management to their
assigned duties without distraction in circumstances arising from the possibility of a
change in control of the Company.  </FONT></P>

done, or omitted to be done, by you in knowing bad faith and without           reasonable
belief that your action or omission was in, or not opposed to, the           best
interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority
          given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the
          advise of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
          omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of the

been           terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to
you a           copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
than           three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the
Board           called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to you and an

          The &#147;Capped Benefit&#148; equals the Specified Benefits, reduced by the

          being a &#147;parachute payment&#148; as defined in Section 280G (b)(2) of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;IRC&#148;), or any successor
          provision. The amount of the Capped Benefit shall therefore equal (1) three
          times the &#147;base amount&#148; as defined in IRC, &sect; 280G (b)(3)(A)
          reduced by $1 (One Dollar), and further reduced by (2) the present value of all
          other payments and benefits you are entitled to receive from the Company that
          are contingent upon a change in control of the Company within the meaning of
IRC           &sect; 280G (b)(2)(A)(i), including accelerated vesting of options and
          other awards under the Company&#146;s stock option plans, and increased by (3)
          all Specified Benefits that are not contingent upon a change in control within
          the meaning of IRC &sect; 280G (b)(2)(A)(i). If you receive the Capped
          Benefit, you may determine the extent to which each of the Specified Benefits
          shall be reduced. The parties recognize that there is some uncertainty
regarding           the computations under IRC &sect; 280G which must be applied to
determine           the Capped Benefit. Accordingly, the parties agree that, after the
Severance           Benefit is paid, the amount of the Capped Benefit may be
retroactively adjusted           to the extent any subsequent Internal Revenue Service
regulations, rulings,           audits or other pronouncements establish that the
original calculation of the           Capped Benefit was incorrect. In that case, amounts
shall be paid or reimbursed           between the parties so that you will have received
the Severance Benefit you           would have received if the Capped Benefit had
originally been calculated           correctly.  </FONT>
