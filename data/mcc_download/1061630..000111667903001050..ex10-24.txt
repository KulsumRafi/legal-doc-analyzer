                "Violation" has the meaning set forth in Section 5(a)(i).

                Section 2. Registration under the Securities Act.

                (a) Registration Requirement. The Company shall use best efforts
to file with the Commission a Shelf Registration Statement meeting the
requirements of the Securities Act within 30 days following the Closing Date,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement
to be declared effective by the Commission within 120 days after the filing of
any such Shelf Registration Statement, provided however, the Company shall not
be required to file a Shelf Registration Statement or cause it to be declared
effective during any Delay Period. No Holder of Registrable Securities shall be
entitled to include any of its Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration
pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder agrees in writing to be
bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder and
furnishes to the Company in writing, within 10 Business Days after receipt of a
request therefor, such information as the Company may, after conferring with
counsel with regard to information relating to Holders that would be required by
the Commission to be included in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus
included therein, reasonably request for inclusion in any Shelf Registration
Statement or Prospectus included therein. Each Holder as to which any Shelf
Registration is being effected agrees to furnish to the Company all information
with respect to such Holder necessary to make


                                       4

<PAGE>


the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not
materially misleading.

                (b) Effectiveness Requirement. The Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to keep each Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective and the Prospectus usable for resales for a period commencing on the
date that such Shelf Registration Statement is initially declared effective by
the SEC and terminating on the date when all of the Registrable Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such
Shelf Registration Statement or cease to be Registrable Securities (the
"Effectiveness Period"); provided, however, the Company shall be permitted to
suspend sales of Securities during any Delay Period.

                (c) Delay Period. The term "Delay Period" shall mean, with
respect to any obligation to file a Shelf Registration Statements or to keep any
Prospectus usable for resales pursuant to this Section 2, the shortest period of
time determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose
when there exist circumstances relating to a material pending development,
including but not limited to a pending or contemplated material acquisition or
merger or other material transaction or similar event, which would require
disclosure by the Company in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus of
material information which the Company determines in good faith that it has a
bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and non-public and the
non-disclosure of which in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus might
cause such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus to fail to comply with
applicable disclosure requirements. A Delay Period shall commence on and include
the date that the Company gives written notice (a "Delay Notice") to the Holders
that it is not required to file any Shelf Registration Statement or cause it to
be declared effective or the Prospectus is no longer usable as a result of a
material pending development pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof and shall end on
the date when the Holders are advised in writing by the Company that the current
Delay Period has terminated (it being understood that the Company shall give
such notice to all Holders promptly upon making the determination that the Delay
Period has ended); provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to
Delay Periods having durations that exceed ninety (90) days in the aggregate
during any calendar year. The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not
deliver a Delay Notice with respect to a Delay Period unless Company employees,
officers and directors and their Affiliates and any other holders of
registration rights with respect to the Company's Common Stock are also
prohibited by the Company for the duration of such Delay Period from effecting
any public sales of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them. The
Company represents that it has no knowledge of any circumstance that would
reasonably be expected at the time of the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant
to Section 2(a) to cause the Company to exercise its rights under this Section
2(c).

                (d) Notice. Each Holder agrees that it shall give the Company
notice of not less than one (1) Business Day prior to disposing of any
Registrable Securities


                                       5


<PAGE>


under a Shelf Registration Statement so that the Company may make any
determination to suspend sales of Securities as contemplated in Section 2(b)
hereof. The Company will, in the event a Shelf Registration Statement is
declared effective, provide to each Holder a reasonable number of copies of the
Prospectus which is a part of such Shelf Registration Statement, notify each
such Holder when such Shelf Registration Statement has become effective and take
such other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the
Registrable Securities. The Company further agrees to supplement or amend each
Shelf Registration Statement if and as required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and
regulations thereunder for shelf registrations, and the Company agrees to
furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement
or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the Commission.

                (e) Effective Shelf Registration Statement. A Shelf Registration
Statement will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been
declared effective by the Commission; provided, however, that if, after it has
been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement of the Commission or any other governmental agency or
court, such Shelf Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been
effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement may legally
resume. The Company will be deemed not to have used its reasonable best efforts
to cause a Shelf Registration Statement to become, or to remain, effective
during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action or omits to take
any action that would result in any such Shelf Registration Statement not being
declared effective or that would result in the Holders of Registrable Securities
covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Registrable Securities
during that period, unless such action or omission is required by applicable
law.

                (f) Eligibility. As of the Closing Date, the Company will be
eligible to file a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to the Registrable
Securities.

                Section 3. Registration Procedures.

                (a) Obligations of the Company. In connection with its
obligations under Section 2 hereof with respect to the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:

                        (i) prepare and file with the Commission a Shelf
                Registration Statement as prescribed by Section 2(a) within the
                relevant time period specified in Section 2(a) hereof on the
                appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form shall (i)
                be selected by the Company, (ii) be available for the sale of
                the Registrable Securities by the selling Holders thereof, and
                (iii) comply as to form in all material respects with the

<PAGE>


                requirements of the applicable form and include all financial
                statements required by the Commission to be filed therewith; the
                Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
                Shelf Registration Statement to become effective and remain
                effective and the Prospectus usable for resales in accordance
                with Section 2 hereof, subject to the proviso contained in
                Section 2(b) hereof; provided, however, that, before filing any
                Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
                supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to and afford the
                Holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf
                Registration Statement, their counsel and the managing
                underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to review copies
                of all such documents (including copies of any documents to be
                incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto)
                proposed to be filed; and the Company shall not file any Shelf
                Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
                supplements thereto in respect of which the Holders must be
                afforded an opportunity to review prior to the filing of such
                document, other than filings required under the Exchange Act, if
                the Holders, their counsel or the managing underwriters of an
                underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, if any, shall
                reasonably object in a timely manner;

                        (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such
                amendments and post-effective amendments to such Shelf
                Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Shelf
                Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period,
                subject to the proviso contained in Section 2(b) hereof or as
                reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority of Registrable
                Securities, and cause each Prospectus to be supplemented, if so
                determined by the Company or requested by the Commission, by any
                required prospectus supplement and as so supplemented to be
                filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provision then in
                force), under the Securities Act, respond within a reasonable
                time to any comments received from the Commission with respect
                to such Shelf Registration Statement, or any amendment,

                comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange
                Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
                applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all

                Statement during the Effectiveness Period in accordance with the
                intended method or methods of distribution by the selling
                Holders thereof described in this Agreement;

                Statement and each underwriter of an underwritten

<PAGE>


                offering of Registrable Securities shall reasonably request in
                writing in advance of such date of effectiveness, and do any and
                all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or
                advisable to enable such Holder and underwriter to consummate
                the disposition in each such jurisdiction of such Registrable
                Securities owned by such Holder; provided, however, that the

                corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction

                underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, if any, and
                promptly confirm such notice in writing (A) when the Shelf
                Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities has
                become effective and when any post-effective amendments thereto
                become effective, (B) of any request by the Commission or any
                state securities authority for amendments and supplements to
                such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or for
                additional information after such Shelf Registration Statement

                closing of any sale of Registrable Securities covered thereby,
                the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
                any purchase agreement, securities sales agreement or other
                similar agreement cease to be true and correct in all material
                respects, (E) of the happening of any event or the failure of
                any event to occur or the discovery of any facts, during the
                Effectiveness Period, which makes any statement made in such
                Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in
                any material respect or which causes such Shelf Registration
                Statement or Prospectus to omit to state a material fact
                necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
                of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
                and (F) of the reasonable determination of the Company that a
                post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement
                would be appropriate;

                        (v) take reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any
                stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Shelf

                incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless
                requested) as such Holder or managing underwriters, if any, may
                reasonably request;

                        (vii) deliver to each selling Holding of Registrable
                Securities and each managing underwriter participating in any
                such disposition of Registrable Securities, if any, without

                the Registrable Securities by such Holder or underwriter;

                        (viii) cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable
                Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
                certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and
                not bearing any restrictive legends and registered in such names

                request at least two Business Days prior to the closing of any
                sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
                Registration Statement relating thereto;

                that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the

                untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
                fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
                light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                misleading;

                reference therein, in each case, as are customarily made by
                issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings (all of the

                accountant or other agent retained by any such selling Holder or

                of the Company and its subsidiaries to supply all relevant
                information in each case reasonably requested by any such
                Inspector in connection with such Shelf Registration Statement,
                records and information which the Company, in good faith,
                determines to be confidential and any Records and information
                which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be
                disclosed to any Inspector except where (i) the disclosure of

                Registration Statement, (ii) the release of such Records or
                information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order

                available to the public; each selling Holder of such Registrable
                Securities will be required to agree in writing that Records and
                information obtained by it as a result of such inspections shall
                be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it as the basis
                for any market transactions in the securities of the Company
                unless and until such is made generally available to the public

                selling Holder of such Registrable Securities will be required
                to further agree in writing that it will, upon learning that
                disclosure of such Records or information is sought in a court
                of competent jurisdiction, or in connection with any action,
                suit or proceeding, give notice to the Company and allow the
                Company at its expense to undertake appropriate action to
                prevent disclosure of the Records and information deemed
                confidential;

                        (xiii) comply with all applicable rules and regulations
                of the Commission so long as any provision of this Agreement
                shall be applicable and make generally available to its
                securityholders earning statements satisfying the provisions of

                any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later
                than 45 days after the end of any twelve-month period (or 90
                days after the end of any twelve-month period if such period is
                a fiscal year) or, in each case, such shorter period as may be
                required for the filing of reports containing quarterly and
                annual financial statements pursuant to the rules and
                regulations adopted under the Securities Act from time to time
                (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which
                Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm
                commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not
                sold to underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the
                first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Company after the
                effective date of a Shelf Registration Statement, which
                statements shall cover said twelve-month periods, provided that
                the obligations under this Section 3(l) shall be satisfied by
                the timely filing of quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q
                and 10-K under the Exchange Act;

                        (xiv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable
                Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement and each
                underwriter, if any, participating in the disposition of such
                Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in
                connection with any filings required to be made with the NASD;

                        (xv) take all other steps necessary to effect the
                registration of the Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf
                Registration Statement contemplated hereby; and

                        (xvi) notwithstanding any other provision of this
                Section 3, if the Company becomes ineligible to use the
                registration form on which the Shelf Registration Statement is
                filed and declared effective pursuant to Section 2(a), thereby
                precluding any Holder from using the related Prospectus, the
                Company shall use best efforts to prepare and file either a post
                effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement to
                convert such registration statement to, or a new Shelf
                Registration Statement on, another registration form which the
                Company is eligible to use within 30 days after the date that
                the Company becomes ineligible, provided such other registration
                form shall be available for the sale of the Registrable
                Securities by the selling Holders thereof and such amended or
                new Shelf Registration Statement shall remain subject in all
                respects to the provisions of this Section 3.

                (b) Holders' Obligations.

                        (i) Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice
                from the Company of the occurrence of any event specified in
                Sections 3(a)(iv)(B), 3(a)(iv)(C), 3(a)(iv)(E), 3(a)(iv)(F)
                hereof or any Delay Notice, such Holder will forthwith
                discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
                the Shelf Registration Statement at issue until such Holder's
                receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
                contemplated by Section 3(a)(viii) hereof or until it is advised
                in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the
                applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, if so directed by the
                Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at the
                Company's expense) all copies in such Holder's possession, other
                than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of
                the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at
                the time of receipt of such notice.

                        (ii) Each Holder agrees that the Company may require
                each seller of Registrable Securities as to which any
                registration is being effected to furnish to it such information
                regarding such seller as may be required by the staff of the
                Commission to be included in the applicable Shelf Registration
                Statement, the Company may exclude from such registration the
                Registrable Securities of any seller who fails to furnish such
                information within 10 Business Days after receiving such
                request, and the Company shall have no obligation to register
                under the Securities Act the Registrable Securities of a seller
                who so fails to furnish such information.

                Section 4. Expenses of Registration. The Company shall bear and
pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing, or
qualification of Registrable Securities with respect to a Shelf Registration
Statement for each selling Holder, including all registration, exchange listing,
accounting, filing and NASD fees, all fees and expenses of complying with
securities or Blue Sky laws, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the Company, and of the Company's independent public accountants,
including the expenses of "comfort letters" required by or incident to such
performance and compliance and reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm of
counsel and one firm of accountants for ABP. Holders shall be responsible for
any underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes of any kind (including
without limitation, transfer taxes) relating to any disposition, sale or
transfer of Registrable Securities.

                Section 5. Indemnification; Contribution.

                (a) Indemnification by the Company. If any Registrable
Securities are included in a Shelf Registration Statement under this Agreement:

                        (i) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
                Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder,
                each Person, if any, who controls such selling Holder within the
                meaning of the Securities Act, and each officer, director,
                trustee, partner, and employee of such selling Holder and such
                controlling Person, against any and all losses, claims, damages,
                liabilities and expenses (joint or several), including
                attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation,
                incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened
                action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of
                the foregoing Persons may become subject under the Securities
                Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state laws, insofar as
                such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out
                of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions
                or violations (collectively, a "Violation"):

                                (A) Any untrue statement or alleged untrue
                        statement of a material fact contained in such
                        registration statement, including any preliminary
                        prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any
                        amendments or supplements thereto or any document
                        incorporated by reference therein;

                                (B) The omission or alleged omission to state
                        therein a material fact required to be stated therein,
                        or necessary to make the statements therein not
                        misleading; or

                                (C) Any violation or alleged violation by the
                        Company of the federal securities laws, any applicable
                        state securities law or any rule or regulation
                        promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
                        or any applicable state securities law;

provided, however, that the indemnification required by this Section 5(a) shall
not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company
be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such
Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by the indemnified party expressly for use
in connection with such registration; provided, further, that the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 5(a) shall not apply to any underwriter to
the extent that any such loss is based on or arises out of an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a


                                       14


<PAGE>


material fact, or an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact,
contained in or omitted from any preliminary prospectus if the final prospectus
shall correct such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or such
omission or alleged omission, and a copy of the final prospectus has not been
sent or given to such Person at or prior to the confirmation of sale to such
Person if such underwriter was under an obligation to deliver such final
prospectus and failed to do so. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters
participating in the distribution of the Registrable Securities, their officers,
directors, agents and employees and each Person who controls such Persons
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the selling Holders. This indemnity shall be in addition to
any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
such selling Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of
such securities by such Holder.

                (b) Indemnification by Holder. If any of a selling Holder's
Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such selling Holder shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its
officers who shall have signed the registration statement, each Person, if any,
who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, any other selling Holder, any controlling
Person of any such other selling Holder and each officer, director, partner, and
employee of such other selling Holder and such controlling Person, against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint and several),
including attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation,
incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing Persons may
otherwise become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other
federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses arise out or are based upon any untrue statement of a material fact or
any omission of a material fact required to be stated in the Registration
Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained
therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents
incorporated by reference therein), or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light or the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission had been contained in
any information furnished in writing by such selling Holder to the Company
expressly for use in connection with such registration; provided, however, that
(x) the indemnification required by this Section 5(b) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if
settlement is effected without the consent of the relevant selling Holder of
Registrable Securities, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
(y) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this Section 5(b) exceed
the gross proceeds from the


                                       15

applicable offering received by such selling Holder.  In no event shall a Holder
be jointly liable with any other Holder as a result of its indemnification
obligations.

                (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the
commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof
made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this
Section 5, such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a
written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have
the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so
desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties. The
failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable
time following the commencement of any such action, if not otherwise known by
the indemnifying party and if it materially prejudices or results in forfeiture
of substantial rights or defenses, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any
liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5, to the extent of any
damage directly suffered by the indemnifying party as a result thereof, but
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this Section 5. Any fees and
expenses incurred by the indemnified party (including any fees and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or
proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty
(30) days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of
whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder). Any such indemnified party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying
party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party
shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim or
proceeding, (iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the
indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are
different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or
(iv) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, based upon advice of
its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such party and the
indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with
any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar
or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out
of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of more than one additional firm of attorneys (together with
appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, unless
in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party a


                                       16


<PAGE>

conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties with respect to such action, claim or proceeding, in
which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of such additional counsel or counsels). No indemnifying party shall be
liable to an indemnified party for any settlement of any action, proceeding or
claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

                (d) Contribution. If the indemnification required by this
Section 5 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party
hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to in this Section 5:

                        (i) The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
                indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
                payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
                claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as
                is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
                party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions
                which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
                expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
                considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party
                and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to,
                among other things, whether any Violation has been committed by,
                or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party
                or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent,
                knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
                prevent such Violation. The amount paid or payable by a party as
                a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
                expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject
                to the limitations set forth in Section 5(a) and Section 5(b),
                any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such
                party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.

                        (ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
                and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were
                determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
                allocation which does not take into account the equitable
                considerations referred to in Section 5(d)(i). No Person guilty
                of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
                11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
                from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
                misrepresentation.

                (e) Full Indemnification. If indemnification is available under
this Section 5, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party
to the full extent provided in this Section 5 without regard to the relative
fault of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration referred to in Section 5(d)(i) hereof.

                (f) Survival. The obligations of the Company and the selling
Holders of Registrable Securities under this Section 5 shall survive the
completion of any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration
statement under this agreement, and otherwise.

                Section 6. Covenants of the Company. The Company hereby agrees
and covenants as follows:

                (a) Exchange Act Filings. The Company shall file as and when
applicable, on a timely basis, all reports required to be filed by it under the
Exchange Act. If the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to the
Exchange Act, upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Securities, the
Company shall make publicly available the information specified in subparagraph
(c)(2) of Rule 144. The Company shall take such further action as may be
reasonably required from time to time and as may be within the reasonable
control of the Company, to enable the Holders to Transfer Registrable Securities
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by Rule 144 or any similar rule or regulation hereafter
adopted by the Commission. Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable
Securities, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics
thereof.

                In connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition by a
Holder of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall
cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any
Securities Act legend, and enable certificates for such Registrable Securities
to be for such number of shares and registered in such names as the Holder may
reasonably request at least two business days prior to any sale of Registrable
Securities.

                (b) Merger, Consolidations and Sale of Assets. The Company shall
not, directly or indirectly, (x) enter into any merger, consolidation or
reorganization in which the Company shall not be the surviving corporation or
(y) Transfer or agree to Transfer all or substantially all the Company's assets,
unless prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or asset Transfer,
the surviving corporation or the transferee, respectively, shall have agreed in
writing to assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and for
that purpose references hereunder to "Registrable Securities" shall be deemed to
include the securities which the Holders of Registrable Securities would be
entitled to receive in exchange for Registrable Securities pursuant to any such
merger, consolidation or reorganization.

                of the Company and the Holders of a majority of the outstanding
                Registrable Securities, provided that no amendment, modification
                or supplement or waiver or consent to a departure with respect
                to Section 5 hereof shall be effective against any Holder unless
                consented to in writing by such Holder. Any amendment or waiver
                effected in accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon
                each Holder, each future Holder of Registrable Securities, and
                the Company.

                (c) Successors, Assigns and Transferees. This Agreement shall

STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF.

                (g) Specific Performance; Costs and Expenses. The parties hereto
acknowledge that there would be no adequate remedy at law if any party fails to
perform any of its obligations hereunder, and accordingly agree that each party,
in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity,
shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of any other
party under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof having
jurisdiction. The parties agree that if any party or parties violates this
