<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<B><U>Conversion</U>.  </B>The Notes shall be converted
into equity securities of the Company (each a &quot;<U>Conversion</U>&quot;)
upon the terms and conditions set forth below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)  <B><U>Optional Conversion</B></U>.   Upon the written
request of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the

all other Notes shall be converted at the option of the Majority Holders either
into shares of the Company's Common Stock or, in the event that there is a
series of Preferred Stock of the Company issued or proposed to be issued, into
the most senior series of such Preferred Stock. If the Majority Holders, as the
case may be, elect to convert accrued interest into equity securities upon a
Conversion, this election shall apply equally to all of the Notes.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;<B><U>Automatic Conversion</B></U>.<B> </B>In the
event that the closing bid or sales prices (whichever is applicable) of the
Company's Common Stock is at least $0.20 per share (as adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and like transactions) for a period
of 60 consecutive trading days, the entire principal amount of and accrued
interest on this and all other Notes shall automatically be converted (an
&quot;<U>Automatic Conversion</U>&quot;) into shares of the Company's Common
Stock.   The Company shall promptly thereafter provide the Holder written notice
of the terms, effect and mechanics of such Automatic Conversion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;<B><U>Conversion Price</B></U>. The number of shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued upon a
Conversion shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the entire
principal amount of this Note plus (as applicable) accrued interest by (ii)
$0.06 (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2(d)) (the &quot;<U>Conversion
Price</U>&quot;), rounded to the nearest whole share.  </P>

sold (the &quot;<U>Purchase Date</U>&quot;), any Additional Stock (as defined
below) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance
shall automatically be adjusted as set forth in this Section 2(d), unless
otherwise provided in this Section 2(d).</P>
<P>(A)&#9;<B><U>Price Adjustment Formula</U>.  </B>Whenever the Conversion Price
is adjusted pursuant to this Section 2(d), the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted to a price equal to the price paid per share for such Additional
Stock.</P>
<P>(B)&#9;<B><U>Definition of &quot;Additional Stock&quot;</U>.</B>   For
purposes of this Section 2(d), &quot;<U>Additional Stock</U>&quot; shall mean
any shares of Common Stock issued (or deemed to have been issued pursuant to
Section 2(d)(D) by the Company after the Purchase Date) other than </P>
<P>(1)&#9;Common Stock issued pursuant to stock dividends, stock splits or
similar transactions;</P>
<P>(2)&#9;Shares of Common Stock issued or issuable to employees, consultants or
directors of the Company pursuant to a stock option plan or restricted stock
plan or incentive arrangement approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company;</P>
<P>(3)&#9;Capital stock, or options or warrants to purchase capital stock,
issued to financial institutions or lessors in connection with commercial credit
arrangements, equipment financings, commercial property lease transactions or
similar transactions approved by the Board of Directors where the principal
purpose thereof is not to raise additional equity capital for the Company;</P>
<P>(4)&#9;Capital stock, or warrants or options to purchase capital stock,
issued in connection with bona fide acquisitions, mergers or similar
transactions, the terms of which are approved by the Board of Directors of the

venture, technology licensing or development activities, (B)&nbsp;distribution,
supply or manufacture of the Company's products or services or (C)&nbsp;any
other arrangements involving corporate partners that are primarily for purposes
other than raising capital, the terms of which business relationship with such
entity are approved by the Board of Directors.</P>
<P>(C)&#9;<B><U>Determination of Consideration</U>.</B>&#9;In the case of the
issuance of Common Stock for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the
amount of cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable discounts,
commissions or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Company for any
underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.   In
the case of the issuance of the Common Stock for a consideration in whole or in
part other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be
the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors.</P>
<P>(D)&#9;<B><U>Deemed Issuances of Common Stock</U>.</B>  In the case of the
issuance after the Purchase Date of securities or rights convertible into, or
entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional
shares of Common Stock (the &quot;<U>Common Stock Equivalents</U>&quot;), the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this Section&nbsp;2(d):</P>
<P>(1)&#9;The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion, exchange or exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to convertibility, exchangeability or exercisability, including,
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of any Common Stock Equivalents and
subsequent conversion, exchange or exercise thereof shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such securities were issued or such Common Stock Equivalents
were issued and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received
by the Company for any such securities and related Common Stock Equivalents
(excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued
dividends), plus the minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by
the Company (without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments)
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in Section
2(d)(i)(C).</P>
<P>(2)&#9;In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable or in the consideration payable to the Company upon conversion,
exchange or exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents including, but not limited
to, a change resulting from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion
Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such Common Stock
Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock or any payment
of such consideration upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such Common
Stock Equivalents.</P>
<P>(3)&#9;Upon the termination or expiration of the convertibility,
exchangeability or exercisability of any Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Price, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such
Common Stock Equivalents, shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only
the number of shares of Common Stock (and Common Stock Equivalents that remain
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable) actually issued upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents.</P>
<P>(4)&#9;The number of shares of Common Stock deemed issued and the
consideration deemed paid therefor pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)(D)(1) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either Section&nbsp;2(d)(i)(D)(2) or 2(d)(i)(D)(3).</P>
<P>(E)&#9;<B><U>Limits on Conversion Price Adjustments</U>.</B>  Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Section (2)(d)(i), no adjustment of the Conversion
Price pursuant to this Section 2(d)(i) shall (1) except to the limited extent
provided for in Sections 2(d)(i)(D)(2) and 2(d)(i)(D)(3), have the effect of
increasing the Conversion Price above the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment, and (2) have the effect of decreasing the Conversion
Price below the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as of the
Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)(as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations and like transactions).</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;<B><U>Stock Splits and Dividends</U>.  </B>In the event the Company
should at any time after the Purchase Date fix a record date for the
effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend
or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents without payment of any consideration by such holder for the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the
additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof),
then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split
or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Price shall be
appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
conversion of this Note shall be increased in proportion to such increase in
outstanding shares of Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents.</P>
<P>(iii)&#9;<B><U>Reverse Stock Splits</U>.  </B>If the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the
record date of such combination, the Conversion Price shall be appropriately
increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of
this Note shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;<B><U>Mechanics and Effect of Conversion</U>.</B>  No
fractional shares of the Company's capital stock will be issued upon conversion
of this Note.  In lieu of any fractional share to which the Holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Company will pay to the Holder in cash the amount of
the unconverted principal and interest balance of this Note that would otherwise
be converted into such fractional share.  Upon conversion of this Note pursuant
to this Section 2, the Holder shall surrender this Note, duly endorsed, at the
principal offices of the Company or any transfer agent of the Company.  At its
expense, the Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver
to such Holder, at such principal office, a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares to which such Holder is entitled upon such conversion, together
with any other securities and property to which the Holder is entitled upon such
conversion under the terms of this Note, including a check payable to the Holder
for any cash amounts payable as described herein.  Upon conversion of this Note,
the Company will be forever released from all of its obligations and liabilities
under this Note with regard to that portion of the principal amount and accrued
interest being converted including without limitation the obligation to pay such
portion of the principal amount and accrued interest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&#9;<B><U>Payment of Interest</U>.</B>  Upon conversion of
the principal amount of this Note into the Company's equity securities, any
interest accrued on this Note that is not by reason of Section 2(a) or 2(b)
hereof simultaneously converted into equity securities shall be immediately paid
to the Holder.</P>
<P>(g)  &#9;<B><U>Regulatory Compliance</B></U>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that the Company's Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock
Market or another national securities exchange (or a listing application is
pending with any such exchange), a Conversion of this Note (or a conversion into
Common Stock of Preferred Stock issued pursuant to a Conversion of this Note)
shall only be effective to the maximum extent permissible under the applicable
rules and regulations of such an exchange without the approval of the
transaction by the Company's stockholders.  In the event such stockholder
approval is required to give full effect to the Conversion of this Note, the
maximum amount of principal and accrued interest (or the maximum number of
shares of convertible Preferred Stock) that is permissible to be converted
without the approval of the Company's stockholders shall be converted as
otherwise provided herein and the Company shall promptly seek to obtain the
stockholder approval necessary to give full effect to the Conversion.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<B><U>Payment</U>.</B>  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)  &#9;<B><U>Payment</B>.</U>  Except as expressly
contemplated herein, all payments shall be made in lawful money of the United
States of America at such place as the Holder hereof may from time to time
designate in writing to the Company.  Payment shall be credited first to the
accrued interest then due and payable and the remainder applied to principal.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)  &#9;<B><U>Mandatory Prepayment on Liquidation</U>.</B>
If a Liquidation Event (as defined below) is consummated prior to the Maturity
Date or a Conversion, the Company shall pay the Holder an amount (the
&quot;<U>Liquidation Amount</U>&quot;) equal to 150% of the principal amount of
this Note, plus accrued interest. The Liquidation Amount shall be paid in cash
unless the Majority Holders consent in writing to the payment of all or any
portion of the Liquidation Amount in consideration other than cash.   The value
of any such consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair value
thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting
treatment.  Upon payment of the Liquidation Amount, the Company will be forever
released from all of its obligations and liabilities under this Note.  For
purposes of this Note, a &quot;<U>Liquidation Event</U>&quot; shall mean (i) a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company
whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock or otherwise, (ii) any
reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Company where the outstanding
voting securities of the Company immediately before the transaction represent or
are converted into less than 50% of the outstanding voting power of the
surviving entity (or its parent entity) immediately after the transaction, (iii)
a sale or exchange of the Company's capital stock by the stockholders of the
Company in one transaction or a series of related transactions where more than
50% of the outstanding voting power of the Company is acquired by a person or
entity or group of related persons or entities, or (iv) any liquidation or
dissolution of the Company, whether by bankruptcy, a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors, receivership or otherwise. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c)&#9;<B><U>Notices of Certain Transactions</U>.</B>  In
case of any consolidation or merger of the Company, any consolidation or merger
of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or
merger in which the Company is the surviving entity), or any transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company (a &quot;<U>Change of
Control</U>&quot;), the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the Holder a
notice specifying the effective date on which such consolidation, merger or
transfer, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record
of Common Stock are to be determined.  Such notice shall be mailed at least
twenty (20) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event
specified in such notice.  In the event that the Majority Holders submit a
written request for Conversion in connection with a Change of Control (a
&quot;<U>Change of Control Conversion Request</U>&quot;), such Change of Control
Conversion Request will be conditioned on, and will be effected immediately
prior to, the occurrence of such Change of Control.  At such time, the
respective Holders of the Notes shall be deemed to have become the respective
holders of record of the capital stock of the Company issued pursuant to the
Conversion.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;<B>Definition.</B>  The occurrence of any of the

no notice from the Holder shall be required to commence the 15 business day cure
period if the Company has knowledge of failure to perform or observe any such
material covenant or agreement and has not complied with Section 4(b)
