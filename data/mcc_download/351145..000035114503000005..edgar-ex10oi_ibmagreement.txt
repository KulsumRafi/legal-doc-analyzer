EXHIBIT 10(o)(i)

              Agreement to Resolve Patent Infringement Claims

     This  Agreement  to  Resolve Patent Infringement  Claims  (hereinafter
"Agreement"),  shall  be  effective  January  30,  2003  by   and   between
International   Business  Machines  Corporation  ("IBM")   and   Intergraph
Corporation,  Intergraph  Properties  Company,  Inc.,  Intergraph  Software
Technologies  Company  Inc.  and  Intergraph  Hardware  Technologies   Inc.
(cumulatively "Intergraph").

                                WITNESSETH:

     Whereas,  Intergraph previously designed, developed, and  manufactured
computer hardware products; and

     Whereas,  IBM  currently develops, manufactures  and  markets  various
software  products,  electronic components (including integrated  circuits,
circuit boards) and computer systems; and

     Whereas,  Intergraph  and IBM have been engaged in  protracted  patent
licensing discussions pertaining to certain patented technologies  of  each
company,  but now desire to resolve any and all patent infringement  claims
between the parties, as described herein.

     Now  therefore,  in  an  effort to facilitate the  execution  of  more
definitive  agreements  reflecting the 1) sale and  assignment  of  certain
patents from IBM to Intergraph, 2) the cross-licensing of other patents, 3)
the  tender  of  a  balancing payment from IBM to  Intergraph  and  4)  the
development  of  cohesive business relationships between the  parties,  the
parties agree as follows:

A. Patent Cross-License

     In  consideration of each party's performance hereunder,  the  parties
are  entering,  concurrently with this Agreement, into a definitive  patent
cross-license agreement (the Cross-license). The Cross-license reflects the
following terms and provisions:

1. A  balancing  payment  of  $10  million   dollars,  payable  by  IBM  to
  Intergraph. That said balancing payment reflects the paid-up net  present
  value  of the royalty otherwise payable annually over the remaining  term
  of Intergraph's last to expire Clipper patents.

2. That  the Cross-license shall  not grant any implied license or immunity
  (either  directly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise) to any  third
  parties not otherwise expressly licensed under the Cross-license.

3. That the Cross-license shall  not grant a license for products that  are
  produced  by IBM or Intergraph as manufacturer on a contract basis  as  a
  "foundry"  for  the  manufacture  of OEM  products,  which  merely  "pass
  through"  the  manufacturer for resale by an  OEM,  except  as  expressly
  licensed under the Cross-license.

4. That  nothing  in  this  Agreement shall be construed or  considered  to
  create  any  right of sublicense, implied right of license to  any  third
  party,  or  to  extend  any license other than to  the  parties  to  this
  Agreement,  or  construed or considered to create  any  right  to  either
  party  for  "foundry" activities, except as expressly provided under  the
  Cross-license.

5. That the  Cross-license may  be extended to  subsidiaries who  elect  to
  enjoy the benefits and incur the obligations hereunder.



B. Sale of Patents

     IBM  agrees to execute a recordable patent assignment in substantially
the  form, and with substantially the same terms and provision as set forth
in  attached Attachment 1, properly documenting the sale and assignment  of
all rights, title and interest from IBM to Intergraph Hardware Technologies
Company ("IHTC"), to twenty-five US Patents selected by Intergraph from the
list  set forth in Attachment 2, together with all foreign counterparts,  a
list of such selected 25 patents to be provided by Intergraph to IBM within
90  days  after signing of this Agreement. Further, the parties agree  that
such  assignment shall expressly convey the right for IHTC to collect  past
damages  from  the infringement of such patents from third  parties,  other
than  those licensed under such patents. IBM agrees to assist and cooperate
with  IHTC  in the filing of the assignments for the assigned IBM  patents,
and the prosecution of any pending applications and/or further continuation
or derivative rights pertaining to the assigned patents.

C.  Intergraph  Licensing  Program Covering US  Patents  4899275,  4933835,
5091846, 4860192, and 4884197  (Clipper Patents)

     IBM  acknowledges that Intergraph intends to seek payment  for  patent
license  agreements from computer system vendors (other than system vendors
reselling  a  Licensed  Product as defined in the Cross-license,  purchased
from  IBM) under US Patents 4899275, 4933835, 5091846, 4860192, and 4884197
(the Clipper Patents) . Except as relates to court or government orders  or
assertions made by Intergraph against IBM customers pertaining to  products
or  services supplied by IBM, either directly or indirectly, IBM agrees not
to  interfere  with any third-party licensing activity of  Intergraph  with
respect to the Clipper Patents, in particular:

1. Not  to  challenge  the  validity of the Clipper Patents, nor assist  or
  request  any  third  party  to: (i) contest  the  legality,  validity  or
  enforceability  of  any of the Clipper Patents or Intergraph's  ownership
  of  them,  (ii)  request reexamination, or assist or  request  any  third
  party  to  request reexamination of any of the Clipper Patents, or  (iii)
  assert  patent exhaustion or any other theory by which the  covenant  not
  to  sue granted herein extends immunity from suit for infringement  of  a
  Clipper Patent to any third party.

2. Not  to  bring  suit, or  assist others in bringing  suit  to  challenge
  Intergraph's position on exhaustion or implied license issues as  to  the
  Clipper Patents.

3. Not to assist others with arguments of invalidity, exhaustion or implied
  license, or other defenses of any type to the Clipper Patents.

4. Not  to  bring,  assist  in bringing or participate  in  any  litigation
  asserting  that this Agreement or the Cross-license precludes  Intergraph
  from  pursuing license agreements with other computer system vendors  for
  the  Clipper patents, except to the extent of the rights granted pursuant
  to this Agreement and the Cross-license.

D. Intergraph and IBM Business Relations

The  parties  agree to utilize commercially reasonable efforts to  identify
common business opportunities, and/or areas for the development of cohesive
business  relationships between the parties, from  which  the  parties  can
expand  business  and  revenue opportunities for Intergraph  and  IBM.  IBM
agrees  to identify appropriate contacts within IBM, whom can work together
in good faith with appropriate representatives of Intergraph's Mapping GIS,
and  Public  Safety  Divisions,  to  arrange  business,  teaming,  bidding,
reselling, and marketing opportunities between IBM and Intergraph.

E. Releases

The parties further agree that:
1. All  actions taken  with  respect to this Agreement, and/or amounts paid
  in   accordance  herewith,  are  undertaken  in  consideration   of   the
  settlement of patent infringement claims, and are nonrefundable, even  if
  the  validity, scope, or enforceability of any Intergraph or  IBM  patent
  is  subsequently  challenged and deemed to be held invalid,  of  narrower
  scope, or unenforceable.

2. As  additional  consideration for  resolution of all  respective  patent
  infringement  claims,  but  subject to all  of  the  provisions  of  this
  Agreement and the Cross-license, the parties shall release, covenant  not
  to  sue  for,  acquit and forever discharge the other from  any  and  all
  claims  or liability for infringement or alleged infringement of any  IBM
  or  Intergraph  Licensed Patents (as defined in the  Cross-license)  with
  respect  to  performance  by the other prior to the  Effective  Date,  of
  acts,  which if performed on or after the Effective Date, would  be  acts
  licensed under the Cross-license.

F. Term

This  Agreement shall become effective as of the date set forth  above  and
shall  continue  in effect for a period of nine months from  the  effective
date of this Agreement.

G. Public Announcements

The  parties  acknowledge that the parties' licensing arrangements  may  be
material corporate events, and that each party shall have the right to make
an  appropriate filing with the SEC disclosing the material  provisions  of
the  parties'  licensing terms, redacting terms to the extent  permissable.
Further,   IBM  agrees  to  cooperate  with  Intergraph  in  drafting   and
disseminating  of  a joint press release announcing the parties'  licensing
arrangement, subject to the requirements set forth under the Cross-license.

Cross-license, the terms of the Cross-license shall control.
