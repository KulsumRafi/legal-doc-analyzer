<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall establish a bookkeeping account (the "Account") on behalf of each Participant under the Plan. Over the course of each calendar quarter, the
Company shall accrue the amount of compensation elected by the Participant to be deferred under the Plan, and in the month following the end of each calendar quarter, shall increase such amount
deferred for the prior calendar quarter by 15 percent (the "Premium"). With respect to each calendar quarter, the Company shall credit each Participant's Account with a number of units ("Units") based
upon the amount of compensation deferred during such calendar quarter and the Premium related thereto. The number of Units credited on behalf of a Participant with respect to any calendar quarter
shall be determined by dividing the sum of the amount of compensation deferred during such calendar quarter and the Premium related thereto by the average value of the Company's common stock as
determined hereunder. The average value of the Company's common stock shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Company's common stock as reflected by composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange over the last ten (10) trading days of the calendar quarter. For record-keeping purposes, and to facilitate the payment of benefits in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1(b),
the Company shall establish sub-accounts under each Participant's Account to include the number of Units, as adjusted in accordance with Section 9.1, credited to such Account with respect to each
calendar year (the "Annual Credit"). </FONT></P>

the earlier of (i) the consummation of a "Change in Control" of the Company, as defined in Section 4.2, or (ii) the
cessation of Participant's status as an Outside Director, including but not limited to cessation due to the Participant's death, the Company shall make payment to the Participant (or the Participant's
beneficiary, if applicable) of his or her accumulated benefit under the Plan held in the Participant's Account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in accordance with procedures established by the Company in its sole discretion, a Participant may elect to receive payment of any Annual
Credit held in his or her Account as of a date earlier than otherwise applicable under Section 4.1(a), but in no case less than four (4) years after the last day of the calendar year in which the
compensation attributable to Annual Credit was deferred. An election under this Section 4.1(b) with respect to the payment of any Annual Credit shall be effective only as of the first day of the
calendar year after such an election is received by the Company, and shall continue in effect with respect to Annual Credits accrued in subsequent calendar years until the election is revoked by the
Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
payment of a Participant's accumulated benefit under the Plan, or, if applicable, of the balance of any Annual Credit, will be paid to the Participant (or the
Participant's beneficiary, if applicable) as a lump sum payment in the form of Company common stock. The number of shares of Company common stock to be so paid to or on behalf of the Participant shall
be equal to the number of Units held in the Participant's Account at the time payment is made or, if applicable the amount of Units attributable to the Annual Credit being paid; provided, that no
fractional shares of the Company's common stock shall be paid and the Company shall pay cash in lieu of such fractional shares in an amount determined by the Company in its sole discretion. </FONT></P>

Participant will be required to certify that the need cannot be reasonably met from other sources. The determination of the financial need and lack of availability of funds from other sources will be

amount to be withdrawn by the Participant and (2) make a lump sum cash payment to the Participant equal to the amount required to meet the financial need. In no event shall the Company pay more than
the value of the Participant's Account after it is reduced by the Premiums as described in the preceding sentence. In determining the value of the Participant's Account for purposes of this Section
