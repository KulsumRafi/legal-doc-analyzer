                               TENTH AMENDMENT TO
                         NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN
                           FOR NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES

         THIS TENTH AMENDMENT (the "Tenth Amendment") is made effective as of
the 7th day of February, 2003, by PER-SE TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

                                  WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the Company has previously adopted the Per-Se Technologies,
Inc. Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan for Non-Executive Employees, as amended
(the "Plan"); and

         WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company has duly authorized an amendment of the Plan to increase the number of
shares available for grant pursuant to the Plan from 3,980,361 shares to
4,480,361 shares, which is an increase of 500,000 shares.

         NOW, THEREFORE, Section 3 of the Plan is hereby amended by deleting
Section 3 of the Plan in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

                                   SECTION 3.

                         SHARES RESERVED UNDER THE PLAN

                  "There shall be 4,480,361 shares of Stock reserved
         for issuance under this Plan, and such shares of Stock shall
         be reserved to the extent that the Company deems appropriate
         from authorized but unissued shares of Stock and from shares
         of Stock which have been repurchased by the Company.
         Furthermore, any shares of Stock subject to an Option that
         remain unissued after the cancellation or expiration of such
         Option thereafter shall again become available for use under
         this Plan."

         FURTHER, except as specifically amended by this Tenth Amendment, the
Plan shall remain in full force and effect as prior to this Tenth Amendment.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Tenth Amendment to be
effective as of the day and year first above written.



                                       PER-SE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
