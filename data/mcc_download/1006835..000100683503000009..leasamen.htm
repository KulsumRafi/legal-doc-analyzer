<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.&#9;WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant entered into a Lease dated June 4, 1996, which Lease was amended by the First through the Sixteenth Amendments of Lease (collectively the &quot;Amendments&quot;).  The Amendments are summarized in the recitals to the Sixteenth Amendment of Lease, which recitals are incorporated herein by reference.  The Lease and all of the Amendments are herein defined and referred to as the &quot;Lease.&quot;  Terms defined in the Lease shall have the same meanings in this Seventeenth Amendment unless another definition is set forth herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B.&#9;WHEREAS, Tenant has vacated but is still in possession of the portions of the Premises located on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> and 9<SUP>th</SUP> Floors of the Building located at 1825 South Grant Street, San Mateo, California (the &quot;Building&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C. &#9;WHEREAS, if certain conditions specified in this Seventeenth Amendment are satisfied, then Landlord and Tenant wish to agree that, effective March 1, 2003, the Premises under the Lease shall no longer include the areas described on Exhibits A-1 and A-2 attached hereto (the &quot;Relinquished Space&quot;) consisting of approximately 29,833 rentable square feet so that, commencing on such date, the total area of the Premises leased by the Tenant under the Lease shall be reduced to what the parties agree is 205,772 rentable square feet.  The Relinquished Space consists of the following portions of the Premises currently leased by the Tenant under the Lease:  (i) all of the Premises located on the 9<SUP>th</SUP> Floor of the Building and comprising approximately 17,702 rentable square feet, and (ii) a portion of the Premises located on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor of the Building and comprising approximately 12,131 rentable square feet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby enter into this Seventeenth Amendment and agree as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<U>CONDITIONS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Seventeenth Amendment is conditioned upon and shall become effective only if each of the following conditions occurs on or before the date which is first written above:  (i) Landlord elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, to enter into a lease for the Relinquished Space with Catholic Healthcare West, a California non-profit public benefit corporation (hereinafter &quot;CHW), and (ii) Landlord and Tenant enter into the agreement entitled &quot;Transaction Agreement&quot; dated as of the date first above written, which Transaction Agreement contains certain provisions relating to the Relinquished Space; and (iii) each of the documents required to be executed and delivered pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Transaction Agreement before the Transaction Agreement becomes effective (hereinafter the &quot;Transaction Agreements&quot;) shall have been executed and delivered in the manner and by the parties specified in the Transaction Agreement.  If any of the foregoing conditions is not timely satisfied, this Seventeenth Amendment shall be null and void and of no force or effect between Landlord and Tenant, and Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant under or in connection with this Seventeenth Amendment and the Lease shall continue in full force and effect without the modifications set forth in this Seventeenth Amendment.  Landlord has not made any representation or agreement that it will cause any of the foregoing conditions to occur, nor shall Landlord have any obligation to take or to refrain from taking any action which would cause any of the foregoing conditions to occur.  If satisfaction or fulfillment of any of the foregoing conditions requires the agreement or consent of any third party, Landlord shall not have any liability to Tenant if such agreement or consent is not obtained.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<U>RELINQUISHED SPACE</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the conditions set forth in Paragraph 1 above are timely satisfied, then the term of the Lease as applicable to the Relinquished Space shall expire on February 28, 2003 so that effective March 1, 2003 (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;), the Relinquished Space shall no longer be part of the Premises.  The Effective Date shall occur only if the conditions set forth in Paragraph 1 above are timely satisfied.  From and after the Effective Date, the term &quot;Premises&quot; as used in the Lease shall no longer include the Relinquished Space and no option or other right of Tenant under the Lease shall continue to apply to the Relinquished Space.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 2, Tenant shall remain liable for all obligations arising under the Lease with respect to its use and possession of the Relinquished Space prior to the Effective Date.  Tenant agrees to vacate and surrender possession of the Relinquished Space to Landlord as of the Effective Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<U>EFFECT ON BASIC RENT AND ADDITIONAL RENT</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commencing on the Effective Date, Tenant's Basic Rent and Additional Rent shall be reduced by the Basic Rent and Additional Rent payable immediately prior to the Effective Date for the Relinquished Space.  Effective on the Effective Date, therefore, the Basic Rent and Additional Rent for the Premises shall be as shown on Exhibit B and such amounts shall continue to be subject to each of the provisions of the Lease which provide for escalation, change or other modification of the Basic Rent or Additional Rent, or both, computed as of the same times that they would have been computed had this Amendment not been executed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>RESTORATION</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent to Tenant's lease of the Relinquished Space, Tenant made modifications to the Relinquished Space and by letter dated December 4, 2000, attached hereto as Exhibit C (the &quot;December 4, Letter&quot;) agreed to certain restoration provisions.  The parties agree that the restoration provisions contained in the December 4 Letter shall not apply to the Relinquished Space but shall continue to apply to the remainder of the Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<U>DEMISING WALL</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenant has already vacated the Relinquished Space and the portion of the Premises on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor of the Building (the &quot;Retained 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor Premises&quot;) which will remain part of the Premises after the Effective Date.  Exhibit D, attached hereto indicates where the demising walls can be installed which would separate the Relinquished Space from the Retained 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor Premises.  At present, there is no plan to install such demising walls since the Tenant is not currently using the Retained 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor Premises and CHW has agreed not to use them.  At any time subsequent to October 31, 2009, and in the event the demising walls have not been installed, at its election, Landlord may install such demising walls.  Tenant understands that the construction of the demising walls and any related demolition and construction will be disruptive and Tenant agrees that it shall have no claim against Landlord as a result of any such disruption.  Tenant hereby agrees to pay, within thirty (30) days after request, all reasonable costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the design, permitting, construction and installation of such demising walls and any modifications to any Building systems or structures required in connection therewith including, without limitation, all costs incurred for the design, engineering, permitting and construction of any demising walls, exit doors, corridors, recircuiting of lighting, moving light fixtures, modifying HVAC ducts or HVAC controls, modifying firesprinklers, modifying the life safety systems, replacing floor and wall coverings and finishes and replacing and modifying any ceiling system, and any fire separation which may be required anywhere on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Floor as a result of the construction of any of the foregoing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>PARKING</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commencing on the Effective Date, Tenant's total parking allocation shall be reduced by 94 spaces.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;<U>NO BROKERS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Landlord and Tenant each represents to the other that it has not had any dealings with any real estate brokers, agents or finders in connection with the negotiation of this Seventeenth Amendment which has resulted in any obligation to pay a leasing commission or other compensation of any kind to such agent, broker or finder in connection herewith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>REPRESENTATIONS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each party represents to the other that it has full power and authority to execute this Agreement.  Tenant represents that it has not made any assignment, sublease, transfer, or conveyance of the Lease or any interest therein or in the Relinquished Space, and further represents that there is not, and will not hereafter be any claim, demand obligation, liability, action or cause of action by any other party respecting, relating to or arising out of the Relinquished Space, and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord and its partners, agents and affiliates from and against all claims and liabilities arising from any of the same, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;<U>NO OFFER BY LANDLORD; FIRM OFFER BY TENANT</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The submission and negotiation of this Seventeenth Amendment shall not be deemed an offer to enter the same by Landlord, but the solicitation of such an offer from Tenant.  Tenant agrees that its execution of this Seventeenth Amendment constitutes a firm offer to enter the same which may not be withdrawn for a period of ten (10) days after delivery to Landlord.  During such period and in reliance on the foregoing.  Landlord may, at Landlord's option, proceed with such actions as it may deem necessary or appropriate, including without limitation, the negotiation and execution of the Transaction Documents, but no such actions shall be deemed an acceptance of Tenant's offer to enter into this Seventeenth Amendment and such acceptance shall be evidenced only by Landlord signing and delivering this Seventeenth Amendment to the Tenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;<U>ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Seventeenth Amendment represents the entire understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and there are no understandings or agreements between them relating to the Lease or the Premises or the Relinquished Space not set forth in writing and signed by the parties.  No party has relied upon any representation, warranty or understanding not set forth herein or in the Transaction Documents, either oral or written, as an inducement to enter into this Seventeenth Amendment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;<U>COUNTERPARTS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Seventeenth Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.&#9;<U>LEASE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as herein modified the Lease shall remain in full force and effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">TRANSACTION AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THIS TRANSACTION AGREEMENT (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is dated as of February, 2003, by and between Crossroads Associates and Clocktower Associates (collectively &quot;<U>Owner</U>&quot;) and Siebel Systems, Inc. a Delaware corporation (&quot;<U>Siebel</U>&quot;).</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</P></B>
<OL TYPE="A">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Owner and Siebel have entered into a Lease Agreement dated June 4, 1996 and a number of amendments thereto (as amended, the &quot;Siebel Lease&quot;) for premises (the &quot;Siebel Premises&quot;) located, in part, in the building located at 1825 South Grant Street, San Mateo, California (the &quot;Building&quot;).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The parties wish to enter into an amendment to the Siebel Lease (the &quot;Space Reduction Amendment&quot;), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, to reduce the size of the Siebel Premises, effective March 1, 2003, by removing from the Siebel Premises an area in the Building (the &quot;CHW Premises&quot;) containing approximately 29,833 square feet of rentable space.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Siebel expects to realize substantial cost savings, operational efficiencies and other benefits as a result of the execution and delivery of the Space Reduction Agreement.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Owner is willing to enter into the Space Reduction Amendment with Siebel provided that Owner and Catholic Healthcare West, a California non-profit public benefit corporation (&quot;CHW&quot;) execute and deliver a Lease Agreement (the &quot;CHW Lease&quot;), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, under which CHW will lease the CHW Premises from Owner.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Since the CHW Lease will be with a tenant which presents significant risks for the Owner which Siebel does not present, including, without limitation, risks resulting from differences in CHW's industry and the economic and political factors now facing that industry, and because CHW will only agree to pay rent at a level which is lower than the rent which Siebel has been paying for the CHW Premises under the Siebel Lease, Siebel has agreed to execute and deliver to Owner a promissory note (the &quot;Siebel Note&quot;), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, in the original principal amount of $6,508,295.08, to compensate Owner, in part, for assuming the significant additional costs and risks of having CHW as a new tenant in the Building.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In addition, to induce Owner to enter into the CHW Lease, Siebel has agreed to guaranty payment, by CHW, of the Additional Rent, as defined in the CHW Lease, pursuant to the terms of a Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To induce Owner to accept the Siebel Note, Siebel will obtain, and deliver to Owner, an Irrevocable Letter of Credit (the &quot;Siebel Note Letter of Credit&quot;), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>To induce Owner to accept the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent, Siebel will obtain, and deliver to Owner, an Irrevocable Letter of Credit (the &quot;Guaranty Letter of Credit&quot;), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.</LI></P></OL>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms and conditions herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:</P>
<OL>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Effective Date; Conditions to Effectiveness</B>.  This Agreement shall be effective on the date (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;) when each of the following documents has been executed and delivered, without qualification, by each of the parties thereto: (i) the Space Reduction Amendment; (ii) the CHW Lease; (iii) the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent; (iv) the Siebel Note; (v) the Siebel Note Letter of Credit; and (vi) the Guaranty Letter of Credit.  Owner has not made any representation or agreement that it will cause any of the foregoing conditions to occur, nor shall Owner have any obligation to take or to refrain from taking any action, which would cause any of the foregoing conditions to occur.  If satisfaction or fulfillment of any of the foregoing conditions requires the agreement or consent of any third party, Owner shall not have any liability to Siebel if such consent is not given or obtained.</LI></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provisions Applicable to Letters of Credit</B>.  The Siebel Note Letter of Credit and the Guaranty Letter of Credit are referred to collectively as the &quot;Letters of Credit.&quot; The Siebel Note Letter of Credit shall be held by Owner as security for the faithful performance by Siebel of all the terms, covenants, and conditions of the Siebel Note, to be kept and performed by Siebel.  The Guaranty Letter of Credit shall be held by Owner as security for the faithful performance by Siebel of all the terms, covenants, and conditions of the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent, to be kept and performed by Siebel.  Siebel has no interest in either of the Letters of Credit or in the proceeds which are paid or payable thereunder.  If Siebel defaults with respect to any provisions of the Siebel Note, Owner may, but shall not be required to, draw upon all or any portion of the Siebel Note Letter of Credit.  If Siebel defaults with respect to any provisions of the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent, Owner may, but shall not be required to, draw upon all or any portion of the Guaranty Letter of Credit.  The use, application or retention of either of the Letters of Credit, or any portion thereof, by Owner shall not (a) prevent Owner from exercising any other right or remedy provided by the Siebel Note or the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent, or by law, it being intended that Owner shall not first be required to proceed against the either of the Letters of Credit, nor (b) operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Owner may otherwise be entitled.  Siebel acknowledges that Owner has the right to transfer or mortgage its interest in the Building or the project of which the Building is a part and in this Agreement and Siebel agrees that, in the event of any such transfer or mortgage, Owner shall have the right to transfer or assign the Letters of Credit to the transferee or mortgagee and, in the event of such transfer, Siebel shall look solely to such transferee or mortgagee for the return of the Letters of Credit.  Siebel acknowledges and agrees that each of the Letters of Credit constitutes a separate and independent contract between Owner and the issuing bank, that Siebel is not a third party beneficiary of such contract, and that Owner's claim under either of the Letters of Credit for the full amount due and owing thereunder shall not be, in any way, restricted, limited, altered or impaired by virtue of any provision of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, Section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.  If Siebel's obligations under the Siebel Note are satisfied in full by Siebel, Owner shall, upon the date of such satisfaction, return the Siebel Note and the Siebel Note Letter of Credit to Siebel.  If Siebel's obligations under the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent are satisfied in full by Siebel, Owner shall, upon the date of such satisfaction, return the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Guaranty Letter of Credit to Siebel.  Siebel shall, within fifteen (15) days after notice from the Owner, replace the Letters of Credit with new Letters of Credit, issued by an Bank acceptable to the Owner, if the bank which has issued the Letters of Credit becomes insolvent or fails to have a least a &quot;C&quot; rating (or a rating of at least 70 on a scale of 1 to 99 or 100 with 99 or 100 being the highest) from the Sheshunoff Information Services or an equivalent rating service reasonably selected by Owner.  If Siebel fails to do so, then such failure shall be deemed a default under the Siebel Note and under the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Owner shall have the right, but not the obligation, to draw the full amount available under the Letters of Credit.  Amounts drawn under either of the Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Landlord's funds, Neither such funds nor the Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be security deposits under any lease or subject to the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, which provisions are expressly waived by Siebel, to the extent that they would otherwise apply.</LI></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Agreement Concerning the Siebel Note, the Guaranty and the Letters of Credit</B>.  The Siebel Note and the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the payments to be made under the Letters of Credit are separate from the Siebel Lease and from the CHW Lease.  No payment under either of the Letters of Credit shall be deemed rent and no such payment shall be affected by any breach or default under the Siebel Lease or the CHW Lease or any action taken by Owner in connection therewith including without limitation, any modification or termination of any such lease and any mitigation of damages under any such lease.</LI></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Avoidance Immunity</B>.  Siebel acknowledges that Owner's entry into this Agreement is expressly conditioned upon Siebel's assurances that Siebel's performance of its obligations under this Agreement and under the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, and the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the bank's performance under the Letters of Credit shall be immune from avoidance and/or recovery under sections 547 through 550 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &quot;Bankruptcy Code&quot;).  Owner and Siebel intend for this Agreement, the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Letters of Credit to continue in operation and effect in the event an order for relief is entered in a United States Bankruptcy Court naming Siebel as a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code (&quot;Insolvency Proceeding&quot;).  Siebel also agrees that: (i) it is the belief of Siebel that the economic and other terms of this Agreement, the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Letters of Credit are fair and reasonable in the context of prevailing market conditions; (2) Siebel's entry into this Agreement, the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note and the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and Siebel's delivery of the Letters of Credit to the Owner and performance hereunder and thereunder represents a contemporaneous exchange of new value between Siebel and Owner such that the value received by Siebel under this Agreement, and the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Letters of Credit, considering the fair market value of the Siebel Lease as it applies to the CHW Premises prior to the Space Reduction Amendment is equivalent to the value received by Owner hereunder and under the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent and the Letters of Credit; and (3) any attempt by Siebel, any trustee in bankruptcy acting on behalf of Siebel, or any other party, to in any manner hinder, impede, void, invalidate, reject, rescind, or nullify the provisions of this Agreement, the Space Reduction Amendment, the Siebel Note, the Guaranty of Payment of Additional Rent or the Letters of Credit in any Insolvency Proceeding (&quot;Avoidance Action&quot;), will be deemed to be bad faith per se and contrary to the purposes of bankruptcy or other applicable laws, will not be consistent with the exercise of sound business judgment or the best interests of Siebel or any bankruptcy estate of Siebel, and will, in and of itself, constitute cause for purposes of dismissal with prejudice of any such Avoidance Action.</LI></P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">LEASE AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Lease, made this <U>  29<SUP>th</SUP>   </U> day of <U>    January       </U> 2003 between <U>CROSSROADS ASSOCIATES, a California General Partnership AND CLOCKTOWER ASSOCIATES, a California General Partnership</U>, hereinafter called Landlord, and <U>CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE WEST, a California Non-Profit Public Benefit Corporation</U>, hereinafter called Tenant.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">WITNESSETH:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby hires and takes from Landlord those certain premises (the &quot;Premises&quot;) outlined in red on Exhibit &quot;Al and A2&quot;, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference thereto more particularly described as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately 29,833 square feet of rentable space (which includes Tenant's prorata share of building common areas) located on the ninth (9<SUP>th</SUP>) floor (approximately 17,702 square feet) and a portion of the eighth (8<SUP>th</SUP>) floor (approximately 12,131 square feet) of the &quot;Building&quot; located at 1825 South Grant Street, San Mateo, San Mateo County, California.  For purposes of this Lease, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the rentable square footage for the Premises is 29,833 square feet, and that Tenant's proportionate share for purposes of payment of Additional Rent is <U>7.56</U>% of the Complex (&quot;Proportionate Share&quot;).  Tenant's Suite Number in the Building shall be 900/800.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenant hereby acknowledges that the Premises are currently leased and occupied by Siebel Systems, Inc.  This Lease Agreement is contingent upon Landlord entering into a satisfactory, in Landlord's sole opinion, arrangement with Siebel Systems, Inc. (and hereinafter referred to as 'Siebel'), wherein their Lease obligation is modified to make the Premises available for a direct lease with Tenant and a security arrangement is reached.  In the event this Lease is executed by Tenant and the Siebel arrangement is not fully executed within two (2) business days thereafter, at Tenant's election, by written notice to Landlord, Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall be deemed cancelled and of no further force or effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As used herein the Complex shall mean and include all of the land outlined in red and described in Exhibit &quot;B&quot;, attached hereto, and all of the buildings, improvements, fixtures and equipment now or hereafter situated on said land.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Said letting and hiring is upon and subject to the terms, covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth and Tenant covenants as a material part of the consideration for this Lease to perform and observe each and all of said terms, covenants and conditions.  This Lease is made upon the conditions of such performance and observance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<B>USE.</B>  Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 17 below, Tenant shall use the Premises only in conformance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, rules and ordinances for the purpose of <U>General Office uses</U> and for no other purpose.  Tenant shall not do or permit to be done in or about tile Premises or the Complex nor bring or keep or permit to be brought or kept in or about the Premises or the Complex anything which is prohibited by or will in any way increase the existing rate of (or otherwise affect) fire or any insurance covering the Complex or any part thereof, or any of its contents, or will cause a cancellation of any insurance covering the Complex or any part thereof, or any of its contents; provided Landlord acknowledges and agrees that general office use is not prohibited nor will it cause an increase in insurance rates at the Complex.  Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything in, on or about the Premises or the Complex which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Complex or injure or annoy them, or use or allow the Premises to be used for any improper, immoral, unlawful or objectionable purpose, nor shall Tenant cause, maintain or permit any nuisance in, on or about the Premises or the Complex.  No sale by auction shall be permitted on the Premises.  Tenant shall not place any loads upon the floors, walls, or ceiling, which endanger the structure, or place any harmful fluids or other materials in the drainage system of the building, or overload existing electrical or other mechanical systems, provided that the loads and electrical usage typical for general office use are permissible.  No waste materials or refuse shall be dumped upon or permitted to remain upon any part of the Premises or outside of the building in which the Premises are a part, except in trash containers placed inside exterior enclosures designated by Landlord for that purpose or inside of the building proper where designated by Landlord.  No materials, supplies, equipment, finished products or semi-finished products, raw materials or articles of any nature shall be stored upon or permitted to remain outside the Premises or on any portion of common area of the Complex.  No loudspeaker or other devise, system or apparatus which can be heard outside the Premises shall be used in or at the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord.  Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed any waste in or upon the Premises.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless against any loss, expense, damage, attorney's fees, or liability arising out of failure of Tenant to comply with any applicable law, as required by this Lease.  Tenant shall comply with any covenant, condition, or restriction (&quot;CC&amp;R's&quot;) affecting the Premises.  Landlord represents that (a) there are currently no CC&amp;Rs encumbering the Premises and Landlord shall provide Tenant a copy of any new CC&amp;Rs recorded against the Premises in the future; and (b) Landlord owns and operates the Complex under a ground lease (&quot;Ground Lease&quot;) which is in full force and effect, and the terms of this Lease are consistent with and not in conflict with the terms of the Ground Lease.  The provisions of this paragraph (except for the preceding sentence) are for the benefit of Landlord only and shall not be construed to be for the benefit of any tenant or occupant of the Complex.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<B>TERM.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.  Subject to the contingency noted above, the term of this Lease shall be for a period of <U>Ten</U> (10) years (unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided) and, subject to Paragraphs 2(B) and 3, shall commence on the <U>   1<SUP>st</SUP>   </U> day of <U>    March    </U>, 2003 and end on the <U>   28<SUP>th</SUP>    </U> day of February 2013.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B.  Possession of the Premises shall be deemed tendered and the term of this Lease shall commence on March 1, 2003.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord agrees that Tenant, Tenant's agents and independent contractors, may enter the Premises after execution of this Lease by Tenant, but prior to the commencement date of the term, in order that Tenant may complete certain leasehold improvements to the Premises, subject to the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;9 below, and subject to the rights of Siebel.  Tenant agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of such leasehold improvement work on the activities of Siebel within the Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C.  <B>OPTIONS TO EXTEND.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provided Tenant is not in default on any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth hereafter, Tenant is granted the option to extend the term of Lease on the Premises to February 28, 2018 on the following terms and conditions:</P>
<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;On or before June 1, 2012, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of Tenant's exercise of this option to extend the term of the Lease to February 28, 2018.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The extended term of the Lease shall commence on March 1, 2013 and shall terminate on February 28, 2018.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The monthly Basic Rent as of the commencement date of the extended term of the Lease shall be at the then Fair Market Rate.  In determining Fair Market Rate, Landlord and Tenant shall include consideration for lease term, lease rate, escalations, tenant improvement contributions, any other tenant concessions, and the condition of the Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;The then current payment for Additional Rent described in Paragraph 4D of the Lease shall continue to be paid and adjusted according to Paragraph 4D of this Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;This Option to extend can be exercised only by Catholic Healthcare West or by a subsidiary or Affiliate of Catholic Healthcare West for its sole use of the Premises and may not be transferred or assigned to any sublessee or other party, nor may this option be exercised by Catholic Healthcare West, its subsidiary or Affiliate for the use of the Premises by any sublessee or party other than Catholic Healthcare West, its subsidiary or Affiliate.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For purposes of this Paragraph 2C, the Fair Market Rate shall be defined as the prevailing market rate with interim adjustments (if any) then charged for comparable space of comparable quality in the immediate San Mateo/Foster City/Redwood Shores market area.  Within 30 days of Tenant's exercise of Option, Landlord shall notify Tenant of such rate as reasonably determined by Landlord.  Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to agree in writing on such Fair Market Rate.  If Landlord and Tenant do not agree on the Fair Market Rate for the Premises by that date which is one hundred fifty (150) days prior to the commencement of the extended term, then Landlord and Tenant shall each select a licensed real estate broker (the &quot;Brokers&quot;) with a minimum five (5) years commercial leasing experience in the above referenced market area to determine the Fair Market Rate for the Premises.  If the Brokers are unable to agree as to the Fair Market Rate by that date which is one hundred Twenty days (120) days prior to the commencement of the extended term, then the Brokers shall mutually select a third licensed real estate broker (the &quot;Arbitrator&quot;) who has the same minimum qualifications as the Brokers and who has not previously represented either party.  Each broker shall submit to the Arbitrator in an unidentified, sealed envelope his or her determination of the Fair Market Rate for the Premises, and the support thereof, and the Arbitrator shall decide which Broker has most accurately determined the Fair Market Rate, which decision shall be final and binding on both Landlord and Tenant.  Landlord and Tenant shall each pay their own Broker's fees and costs and shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the Arbitrator's fees and costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<B>POSSESSION. </B> If Landlord, for any reason whatsoever, cannot deliver possession of said Premises to Tenant at the commencement of said term, as hereinbefore specified, this Lease shall not be void or voidable; nor obligation of Tenant shall be affected thereby; nor shall Landlord or Landlord's agents be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom; but in that event the commencement and termination dates of the Lease, and all other dates affected thereby shall be revised to conform to the date of Landlord's delivery of possession, as specified in Paragraph 2 (b), above.  The above, is, however, subject to the provision that the period of delay of delivery of the Premises shall not exceed 30 days from the commencement date herein (except those delays caused by Acts of God, strikes, war, utilities, governmental bodies, weather, unavailable materials, and delays beyond Landlord's control shall be excluded in calculating such period) in which instance Tenant, at its option, may, by written notice to Landlord, terminate this Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<B>RENT.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.  <B>Basic Rent.</B>  Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord at such place as Landlord may designate without deduction, offset, prior notice, or demand on the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) day of each calendar month of the term of this Lease, and Landlord agrees to accept as Basic Rent for the leased Premises.  the total sum of <U>Four Million Six Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Three Hundred Seventy Two and 85/100 </U>Dollars ($4,667,372.85) in lawful money of the United States of America, payable as follows:</P>

In the event that the term of this Lease for any reason ends on a date other than the last day of a calendar month, on the first day of the last calendar month of the term hereof Tenant shall pay to Landlord as rent for the period from said first day of said last calendar month to and including the last day of the term hereof that proportion of the monthly rent hereunder which the number of days between said first day of said last calendar month and the last day of the term hereof bears to thirty (30).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C.  <B>Late charge.  </B>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, if Tenant is in default by failing to pay all or any portion of rent as set forth in this Paragraph 4 within ten (10) days of when due, Landlord shall so notify Tenant in writing, by facsimile, or electronically.  If Tenant then fails to pay such delinquent amount within five (5) days of receipt of such notice, then Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, in addition to the delinquent rental due, a late charge equal to ten (10%) percent of each rental payment so in default.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D.  <B>Additional Rent.</B>  Beginning with the second (2<SUP>nd</SUP>) month of the term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord in addition to the Basic Rent and as Additional Rent the following:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(5)&#9;All charges, costs and expenses, which Tenant is required to pay hereunder, together with all interest and penalties, costs and expenses including attorney's fees and legal expenses, that may accrue thereto in the event of Tenant's failure to pay such amounts, and all damages, reasonable costs and expenses which landlord may incur by reason of default of Tenant or failure on Tenant's part to comply with the terms of this Lease.  In the event of nonpayment by Tenant of Additional Rent, Landlord shall have all the rights and remedies with respect thereto as Landlord has for nonpayment of rent.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly, in advance, Tenant's prorata share of an amount estimated by Landlord to be Landlord's approximate average monthly expenditure for such Additional Rent items, which estimated amount shall be reconciled at the end of each calendar year as compared to Landlord's actual expenditure for said Additional Rent items.

Any payments required to be made by Tenant for Additional Rent shall be made by check or instrument separate from that check or instrument used by Tenant to make any payments for Basic Rent pursuant to paragraph 4 A.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The respective obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this paragraph shall survive the expiration or other termination of the term of this Lease, and if the term hereof shall expire or shall otherwise terminate on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the actual Additional Rent incurred for the calendar year in which the term hereof expires or otherwise terminates shall be determined and settled on the basis of the statement of actual Additional Rent for such calendar year and shall be prorated in the proportion which the number of days in such calendar year preceding such expiration or termination bears to 365.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E.&#9;<B>Review of Landlord Statement.</B>  Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period of its obligations under this Lease, Tenant shall have the right, once each calendar year, to reasonably review supporting data for operating costs for the Complex and Tenant's Proportionate Share of such operating costs for the Complex, in accordance with the following procedure:</P>
<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1)&#9;Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after Landlord's Statement is delivered, deliver a written notice to Landlord specifying the portions of Landlord's Statement that are in question or are claimed to be incorrect, and Tenant shall simultaneously pay to Landlord all amounts due from Tenant to Landlord as specified in Landlord's Statement if not previously paid, without waiving Tenant's right to dispute such amounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2)&#9;Tenant acknowledges and agrees that any records reviewed under this Subparagraph E constitute confidential information of Landlord, which shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the accountants performing the review and the principles, employees (on a need-to-know basis), attorneys or consultants of Tenant who receive the results of the review.  The disclosure of such information to any other person, whether or not caused by the conduct of Tenant, shall constitute a material breach of this Lease, unless required by law or pursuant to Tenant's normal accounting and reporting procedures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3)&#9;Any errors disclosed by the review shall be promptly corrected by Landlord, provided, however, that if Landlord disagrees with any such claimed errors after Landlord's own internal review, no corrections shall be made, but if Tenant still disputes the amount of the Additional Rent items set forth in Landlord's Statement and Tenant's Proportionate Share thereof, Tenant shall have the right to elect to cause an independent certified public accounting firm selected by Tenant (and not affiliated with Tenant or compensated on a contingent fee basis or based upon a share of any refund obtained by Tenant) and reasonably acceptable to Landlord (the &quot;Accountant&quot;), to commence and complete an audit of Landlord's books and records directly relevant to Landlord's calculation of the Additional Rent items and Tenant's Proportionate Share, in order to determine the proper amount incurred and amounts payable by Tenant for the calendar year which is the subject of such Landlord's Statement.  If such audit reveals that Landlord has over-charged Tenant, then the amount of overpayment shall be refunded to Tenant within 30 days.  If the audit reveals that the Tenant was under-charged, then Tenant shall reimburse to Landlord the amount of such under-charge with the next succeeding installment obligation of Tenant's Proportionate Share.  If the audit reveals no error in Tenant's charges, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord's third-party, out-of-pocket costs (such as external auditors fees, copy costs, courier costs, etc., but excluding general overhead) in making an internal review, meeting with Tenant, etc.  Tenant agrees to pay the cost of such audit unless the results of such audit reflect that Landlord's Statement overstated Tenant's Proportionate Share by more than two percent (2%), in which case Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable cost of such audit.</P></DIR>

If any portion of said Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, deposit cash with Landlord in the amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount.  Tenant's failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Lease.

If Tenant fully and faithfully performs every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall be returned to Tenant at the expiration of the Lease term and after Tenant has vacated the Premises.  In the event of termination of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord shall transfer said Deposit to Landlord's successor in interest whereupon Tenant agrees to release Landlord from liability for the return of such Deposit or the accounting therefor.</P>

The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any action against Tenant, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not, that Tenant has violated any such law, statute, ordinance or governmental rule, regulation, requirement, direction or provision, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.  This paragraph shall not be interpreted as requiring Tenant to make structural changes or other improvements to the Premises or the Complex, except to the extent such changes or improvements are required as a result of Tenant's particular use of the Premises.  Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with any and all requirements pertaining to said Premises, of any insurance organization or company, necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and commercial general insurance covering the Premises.

Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease or to sublease to an affiliate or subsidiary of Tenant without Landlord's prior approval, but in each such case Landlord shall be fully notified by Tenant of such assignment or sublease.  As a condition for granting its consent to any subletting, Landlord may require that Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as additional rent, all rents received by Tenant from its subtenants in excess of the rent payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder after Tenant shall have deducted from such excess the value of Tenant's costs (such as commissions, legal fees, tenant improvements (amortized at 10%), free rent and architectural, engineering and permit fees) to sublet the Premises.

In all other instances, Landlord shall deliver its approval or disapproval of such assignment or subletting to Tenant in writing (including, in the case of disapproval, a reasonable basis therefore) within fifteen (15) days following Tenant's written request to sublease and Landlord's receipt of all reasonable, supplemental information requested by Landlord.

A consent of Landlord to one assignment, transfer, hypothecation, subletting, occupation or use by any other person shall not release Tenant from any of Tenant's obligations hereunder to be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent similar or dissimilar assignment, transfer, hypothecation, subletting, occupation or use by any other person.  Any such assignment, transfer, hypothecation, subletting, occupation or use without such consent shall be void and shall constitute a breach of this Lease by Tenant.  The leasehold estate under this Lease shall not, nor. shall any interest therein, be assignable for any purpose by operation of law without the written consent of Landlord which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  As a condition to its consent, Landlord may require Tenant to pay all reasonable expenses in connection with the assignment (with attorneys' fees not to exceed $2,000.00 for any one assignment), and Landlord may require Tenant's assignee or transferee (or other assignees or transferees) to assume in writing all of the obligations under this Lease and for Tenant to remain liable to Landlord under the Lease.</P>

Notwithstanding any such subordination, Tenant's possession under this Lease shall not be disturbed if Tenant is not in default and so long as Tenant shall pay all rent and observe and perform all of the provisions set forth in this Lease.  Tenant agrees to send to any mortgagees and/or deed of trust holders, by registered mail, a copy of any notice of default served by Tenant upon the Landlord, provided that prior to such notice, Tenant has been notified, in writing (by way of notice of assignment of rents or otherwise) of the addresses of such mortgages and/or deed of trust holders.  Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, any such mortgagees and/or deed of trust holders shall have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure such default, or if such default is not reasonably susceptible of cure within that time, then such additional time as may be reasonably necessary if within such (30) days, any mortgagee and/or deed of trust holder has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure such default, (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated when such remedies are being diligently pursued and completed within no more than ninety (90) days from expiration of the thirty (30) day period.</P>

Landlord shall also have the right at any time to change the arrangement or location of entrances or passageways, doors and doorways, and corridors, elevators, stairs, toilets or other public parts of the Complex and to change the name, number or designation by which the Complex is commonly known, and none of the foregoing shall be deemed and actual or constructive eviction of Tenant, or shall entitle Tenant to any reduction of rent hereunder, except to the extent Tenant's access to or use of the Premises is materially impaired thereby.  Landlord acknowledges that there may be certain areas of the Premises to which Landlord may not have keys and to which Landlord must be accompanied by a representative of Tenant except in an emergency.</P>

Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as giving or granting or creating an equity in the demised Premises to Tenant.  In no event shall the leasehold estate under this Lease, or any interest therein, be assigned by voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding without the prior written consent of Landlord.  In no event shall this Lease or any rights or privileges hereunder be an asset of Tenant under any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceedings.</P>

Tenant shall have a period of ten (10) days from the date of written notice from Landlord within which to cure any other default under this Lease.

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">February, 2003<BR>
San Mateo, California</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FOR VALUE RECEIVED, SIEBEL SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation, as maker, having its principal place of business at 1825 South Grant Street, San Mateo, California 94402 (&quot;<B>Maker</B>&quot;), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of CROSSROADS ASSOCIATES AND CLOCKTOWER ASSOCIATES (&quot;<B>Holder</B>&quot;), c/o Osborn Capital Management, 1875 South Grant Street, Suite 100, San Mateo, California 94402, Attention: Greg Osborn, or at such other place as the holder hereof may from time to time designate in writing, the principal sum of Six Million Five Hundred Eight Thousand Two Hundred Ninety-Five and 08/100 Dollars ($6,508,295.08) in lawful money of the United States of America.  This Note evidences the obligation of Maker to make payments to the Holder in consideration for Holder entering into the transactions described in the Transaction Agreement between Maker and Holder dated February, 2003 (the &quot;<B>Agreement</B>&quot;).</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 1:  PAYMENT TERMS</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maker agrees to pay sums under this Note on each of the dates and in the amounts shown on the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 2:  DEFAULT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time is of the essence hereof and it is expressly agreed that if Maker shall fall to make any payment under this Note on or before the date the same is due (an &quot;Event of Default&quot;), then Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in addition to all other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to draw upon the Letter of Credit pursuant to the ten-ns thereof for all amounts payable by the Maker hereunder (the &quot;Debt&quot;).</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 4:  DEFAULT INTEREST</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maker agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Holder shall be entitled to receive and Maker shall pay interest (&quot;Interest&quot;) on the entire unpaid principal sum at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (a) the prime rate announced as such from time to time by the Bank of America NTSA, or its successor, plus four percent (4%) and (b) the maximum interest rate allowed by law (the &quot;Default Rate&quot;).  The Default Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of the date upon which the Event of Default is cured or the date upon which all amounts due hereunder have been paid in full.  Interest calculated at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, and shall be deemed secured by the Letter of Credit but shall not itself incur interest.  This clause, however, shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy accruing to Holder by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 5: LATE CHARGE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If any monthly installment payable under this Note is not paid by Maker on or before the date that the same is due, Maker shall pay to Holder, upon demand, an amount equal to two percent (2%) of such unpaid sum to defray the expenses incurred by Holder in handling and processing the delinquent payment (the &quot;Late Charge&quot;) and to compensate Holder for tile loss of the use of the delinquent payment and the amount shall be secured by the Letter of Credit.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 6:  NO PREPAYMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maker may not pay all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 7:  SECURITY</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note is secured by an Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the principal initial stated amount of Six Million Five Hundred Nine Thousand Two Hundred Ninety-Five and 08/100 Dollars ($6,509,295.08) (the &quot;<B>Letter of Credit</B>&quot;), including any extensions, renewals or replacements thereof</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 8:  LOAN CHARGES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note is subject to the express condition that at no time shall Maker be obligated or required to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at a rate which could subject Holder to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the maximum interest rate which Maker is permitted by applicable law to contract or agree to pay.  If by the terms of this Note, Maker is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of such maximum rate, the rate in question shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder.  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Holder for the use, forbearance, or detention of the Debt, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Note until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Debt does not exceed the maximum lawful rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Debt for so long as the Debt is outstanding.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 9:  WAIVERS</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maker and all others who may become liable for the payment of all or any part of the Debt do hereby severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice of dishonor, protest and notice of protest and non-payment and all other notices of any kind, except for notices expressly provided for in this Note.  No release of any security for the Debt or extension of time for payment of this Note or any installment hereof, and no alteration, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Note made by agreement between Holder or any other person or party shall release, modify, amend, waive, extend, change, discharge, terminate or affect the liability of Maker, and any other person or entity who may become liable for the payment of all or any part of the Debt, under this Note.  No notice to or demand on Maker shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation of Maker or of the right of Holder to take further action without further notice or demand as may be provided for in this Note, If Maker is a partnership, corporation or limited liability company, the agreements contained herein shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any changes in the individuals or entities comprising the Maker, and the term &quot;Maker&quot;, as used herein, shall include any alternate or successor entity, but any predecessor entity, and its partners or members, as the case may be, shall not thereby be released from any liability.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 10:  WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MAKER HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THE LOAN EVIDENCED BY THIS NOTE, THIS NOTE, THE LETTER OF CREDIT OR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF HOLDER, ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS OR AGENTS IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 11:  AUTHORITY</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maker represents that Maker has full power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Note and that this Note constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Maker.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 12:  GOVERNING LAW</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note shall be governed, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 13:  NOTICES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be given as provided in the Agreement.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 14:  MISCELLANEOUS</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.1&#9;If either party commences litigation against the other for damages for the breach hereof or otherwise for enforcement of any remedy hereunder, the parties hereto agree to and hereby do waive any right to a trial by jury and, in the event of any such commencement of litigation, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party such costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as may have been incurred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.2&#9;This Note may not be modified, amended, waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any act or failure to act on the part of Maker or Holder, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any modification, amendment, waiver, extension, change, discharge of termination is sought.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.3&#9;If Maker consists of more than one person or party, the obligations and liabilities of each person or party shall be joint and several.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.4 Whenever used, the singular number shall include the plural, the plural number shall include the singular, and the words &quot;Holder&quot; and &quot;Maker&quot; shall include their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.5&#9;Maker recognizes that its default in making any payment as provided herein as agreed to be paid when due, or the occurrence of any other Event of Default hereunder, will require Holder to incur additional expense in servicing and administering the Loan, in loss to Holder of the use of the money due and in frustration to Holder in meeting its other financial commitments and that the damages caused thereby would be extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain.  Maker agrees (a) that an amount equal to the Late Charge plus the accrual of interest at the Default Rate is a reasonable estimate of the damage to Holder in the event of a late payment, and (b) that the accrual of interest at the Default Rate following any other Event of Default is a reasonable estimate of the damage to Holder in the event of such other Event of Default, regardless of whether there has been an acceleration of the Loan.  Nothing in this Note shall be construed as an obligation on the part of Holder to accept, at any time, less than the full amount then due hereunder, or as a waiver or limitation of Holder's right to compel prompt performance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.6&#9;Upon notice from Holder to Maker of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note and, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Maker from Holder (except that if the Holder initially named herein is the holder of this Note, an indemnification from the Holder initially named herein shall be sufficient) or, in the case of mutilation hereof, upon surrender of the mutilated Note, Maker will make and deliver a new note of like tenor in lieu of this Note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.7&#9;Holder, at any time and without the consent of Maker, may grant participations in or sell, transfer, assign and convey all or any portion of its right, title and interest in and to the loan evidenced by this Note, this Note and any collateral given as security for the loan evidenced by this Note, including, without limitation, the Letter of Credit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has duly executed this Note as of the day and year first above written.</P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">GUARANTY OF PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL RENT</P></B></U>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THIS GUARANTY OF PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL RENT (this &quot;<B>Guaranty</B>&quot;) is made as of February, 2003, by SIEBEL SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the &quot;<B>Guarantor</B>&quot;), whose address is as set forth in Section 10 hereof, in favor of CROSSROADS ASSOCIATES AND CLOCKTOWER ASSOCIATES (&quot;<B>Landlord</B>&quot;), having an office at 1875 South Grant Street, Suite 100, San Mateo, California 94402.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Landlord and CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE WEST, a California non-profit public benefit corporation (&quot;<B>Tenant</B>&quot;) desire to enter into that certain Office Lease dated February, 2003 (the &quot;<B>Lease</B>&quot;) concerning approximately 29,833 square feet on the eighth (8<SUP>th</SUP>) and ninth (9<SUP>th</SUP>) floors, Suite 900/800, of the office building located at 1825 South Grant Street, San Mateo, San Mateo County, California;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the proposed Lease will result in a financial benefit to Guarantor because the Lease is for premises which were formerly leased by the Guarantor; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Landlord would not execute the Lease if Guarantor did not execute and deliver to Landlord this Guaranty.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the execution of the foregoing Lease by Landlord and as a material inducement to Landlord to execute said Lease, Guarantor hereby absolutely, presently, continually, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the prompt payment by Tenant of Additional Rent (as such term is defined in the Lease) payable by Tenant under said Lease:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;It is specifically agreed and understood that the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease may be altered, affected, modified, amended, compromised, released or otherwise changed by agreement between Landlord and Tenant, or by course of conduct and the Lease may be assigned by or with the consent of Landlord or any assignee of Landlord without consent or notice to Guarantor and that this Guaranty shall thereupon and thereafter continue to guaranty the prompt payment of Additional Rent as if the Lease had not been so changed, modified, amended, compromised, released, or altered.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;This Guaranty shall not be released, modified or affected by failure or delay on the part of Landlord to enforce any of the rights or remedies of Landlord under the Lease, whether pursuant to the terms thereof or at law or in equity, or by any release of any person liable under the terms of the Lease (including, without limitation, Tenant) or any other guarantor, including without limitation, any other Guarantor named herein, from any liability with respect to Guarantor's obligations hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall continue until all Additional Rent due under the Lease through October 31, 2009 has been paid in full in cash.  Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by any payments of Additional Rent which are paid to Landlord by replacement tenants, provided such replacement tenants have been authorized by and consented to by the Landlord.  If all or any portion of Tenant's obligations under the Lease is paid or performed by Tenant, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) or performance(s) is avoided or recovered directly or indirectly from Landlord as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;Guarantor warrants and represents to Landlord that Guarantor now has and will continue to have full and complete access to any and all information concerning the Lease, the value of the assets owned or to be acquired by Tenant, Tenant's financial status and its ability to pay and perform the obligations owed to Landlord under the Lease.  Guarantor further warrants and represents that Guarantor has reviewed and approved copies of the Lease and is fully informed of the remedies Landlord may pursue, with or without notice to Tenant, in the event of default under the Lease.  So long as any of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder remains unsatisfied or owing to Landlord, Guarantor shall keep fully informed as to all aspects of Tenant's financial condition and the performance of said obligations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with Landlord that if a default shall at any time occur in the payment of any Additional Rent under the Lease, Guarantor shall and will forthwith upon demand pay such sums and any arrears thereof, to Landlord in legal currency of the United States of America for payment of public and private debts, and take all other actions necessary to cure such default and perform such obligations of Tenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collectibility, and is not conditioned or contingent upon the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Lease or the pursuit by Landlord of any remedies which it now has or may hereafter have with respect thereto, at law, in equity or otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of to the extent permitted by law: (i) all notices to Guarantor, to Tenant, or to any other person, including, but not limited to, notices of the acceptance of this Guaranty or the creation, renewal, extension, assignment, modification or accrual of any of the obligations owed to Landlord under the Lease and, except to the extent set forth in <U>Section 9</U> hereof, enforcement of any right or remedy with respect thereto, and notice of any other matters relating thereto; (ii) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (iii) demand of payment, presentation and protest; (iv) any right to require Landlord to apply to any default any security deposit or other security it may hold under the Lease; (v) any statute of limitations affecting Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof, (vi)&nbsp;any right or defense that may arise by reason of the incapability, lack of authority, death or disability of Tenant or any other person; and (vii) all principles or provisions of law which conflict with the terms of this Guaranty.  Guarantor further agrees that Landlord may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence of a default under the Lease, notwithstanding any dispute between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the existence of said default or performance of the obligations under the Lease or any counterclaim, set-off or other claim which Tenant may allege against Landlord with respect thereto.  Moreover, Guarantor agrees that Guarantor's obligations shall not be affected by any circumstances which constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;Guarantor agrees that Landlord may enforce this Guaranty without the necessity of proceeding against Tenant or any other guarantor.  Guarantor hereby waives the right to require Landlord to proceed against Tenant, to proceed against any other guarantor, to exercise any right or remedy under the Lease or to pursue any other remedy or to enforce any other right.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;(a)&#9;Guarantor agrees that nothing contained herein shall prevent Landlord from suing on the Lease or from exercising any rights available to it thereunder and that the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights shall not constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Guarantor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all benefits under California Civil Code &sect;&sect; 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845, 2847, 2848, 2849 and 2850, and the second sentence of California Civil Code &sect; 2822(a).  In addition, each Guarantor agrees that Landlord (not Tenant) shall have the right to designate the portion of Tenant's obligations under the Lease that is satisfied by a partial payment by Tenant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;Guarantor agrees that Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation against Tenant or any right of contribution against any other guarantor unless and until all amounts due under the Lease have been paid in full and all other obligations under the Lease have been satisfied.  Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver of Guarantor's rights of subrogation and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation Guarantor may have against Tenant shall be junior and subordinate to any rights Landlord may have against Tenant, and any rights of contribution Guarantor may have against any other guarantor shall be junior and subordinate to any rights Landlord may have against such other guarantor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered, limited or affected by any case, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Tenant or any defense which Tenant may have by reason of order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such case.  Landlord shall have the sole right to accept or reject any plan on behalf of Guarantor proposed in such case and to take any other action which Guarantor would be entitled to take, including, without limitation, the decision to file or not file A claim.  Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any payment relating to Additional Rent which accrues with respect to Tenant's obligations under the Lease after the commencement of any such proceeding (or, if any such payment ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such proceeding, such payment as would have accrued if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be included in Guarantor's obligations hereunder because it is the intention of the parties that said obligations should be determined without regard to any rule or law or order which may relieve Tenant of any of its obligations under the Lease.  Guarantor hereby permits any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay Landlord, or allow the claim of Landlord in respect of, any such payment accruing after the date on which such proceeding is commenced.  Guarantor hereby assigns to Landlord Guarantor's right to receive any payments from any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person by way of dividend, adequate protection payment or otherwise.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;Any notice, statement, demand, consent, approval or other communication required or permitted to be given, rendered or made by either party to the other, pursuant to this Guaranty or pursuant to any applicable law or requirement of public authority, shall be in writing (whether or not so stated elsewhere in this Guaranty) and shall be deemed to have been properly given, rendered or made only if hand-delivered or sent by first-class mail, postage pre-paid, addressed to the other party at its respective address set forth below, and shall be deemed to have been given, rendered or made on the day it is hand-delivered or one day after it is mailed, unless it is mailed outside of San Mateo County, California, in which case it shall be deemed to have been given, rendered or made on the third business day after the day it is mailed.  By giving notice as provided above, either party may designate a different address for notices, statements, demands, consents, approvals or other communications intended for it.</P>

Upon complete execution of this Agreement by the parties, and satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 1 above, Lessor agrees that Lessee may have access to the Premises during business hours to complete certain leasehold improvements to the Premises, as long as Lessee uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of such activities on Lessor's use of the Premises, provided that Lessee's obligations under Section 13 shall be in effect as soon as Lessee or its agents, contractors or invitees enter the Premises, and provided further that Lessee shall have provided to Lessor prior to such entry a certificate of insurance reflecting that Lessee has caused Lessor to be named as an additional insured under the comprehensive liability insurance policy Lessee is required to carry under the Lease with Office Lessor.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Condition Of Leased Equipment; No Warranties By Lessor; Maintenance, Compliance With Laws And Insurance</B></U>.  PRIOR TO EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, LESSEE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE LEASED EQUIPMENT AND AGREES TO LEASE THE EQUIPMENT &quot;AS IS.&quot;   Lessee agrees, at its own cost and expense, (a) except to the extent of any non-compliance caused by Lessor, to comply with all governmental laws, ordinances, regulations, requirements and rules with respect to the use, maintenance and operation of the Leased Equipment; (b) to maintain at all times insurance in type and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, protecting Lessor's interest as it may appear, and deliver to Lessor reasonable evidence of such insurance coverage; (c) to make all repairs and replacements required to be made to maintain the Leased Equipment in good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted; and (d) to pay all utility expenses incurred in its use of the Leased Equipment.</LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Title of the Lessor</B></U>: Subject to Lessor's right to require Lessee to purchase the Leased Equipment and subject to Lessee's right to purchase the Leased Equipment as set forth in Sections 10 and 11, title to the Leased Equipment shall at all times remain in the Lessor, and the Leased Equipment is and shall at all times remain personal property.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Quiet Enjoyment</B></U>.  Lessor represents and warrants that Lessee will have quiet enjoyment of the Leased Equipment during the Term, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Lessee's quiet enjoyment shall not be deemed to be disturbed when and if Lessor constructs a demising wall between the Offered Suite and Lessee's space on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> floor.  Lessee shall cooperate with Lessor to permit Lessor to construct such demising wall during business hours, provided that Lessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of such construction on Lessee's use.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Lessee's Purchase of the Leased Equipment</B></U>.  </LI></P>

<LI><P Align="Justify">At any time during the Term, Lessor may demand in writing (the &quot;<I>Demand</I>&quot;) that Lessee purchase the Leased Equipment for a purchase price not to exceed One Dollar ($1.00) (the &quot;<I>Purchase Price</I>&quot;).  Lessee shall have fifteen (15) days following receipt of the Demand to commit to purchase the Leased Equipment for the Purchase Price.  Lessee shall have fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the initial fifteen (15) day period described above to consummate the transaction.  </LI></P>


<LI><P Align="Justify">If Lessee has not previously purchased the Leased Equipment, Lessee shall purchase the Leased Equipment on the Expiration Date for the Purchase Price.  Lessee shall have fifteen (15) days after the Expiration Date to consummate the transaction.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Right of First Offer</B></U>.  Exhibit A identifies by unshadowed crosshatching the space located on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> floor of the building that is not included in the Premises and consists of 5571 rentable square feet (the &quot;<I>Offered Suite</I>&quot;).  During the term of this Agreement, subject to Office Lessor's prior consent and provided Lessee is not in default under any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, Lessor hereby grants to Lessee the right of first offer to sublease the Offered Suite from Lessor (the &quot;<I>Right of First Offer</I>&quot;).  Lessee's Right of First Offer shall be upon and subject to the following terms and conditions:  </LI></P>

<LI><P Align="Justify">Lessee's right to sublease the Offered Suite shall be the right to accept a proposal by Lessor for such Suite.  Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing of the availability of the space and shall tender to Lessee the terms under which Lessor would sublease the space to Lessee.  The terms shall include the rent, increases in rent, the term, the tenant improvement allowance, if any, and the like.  Lessee shall have ten (10) days from receipt of such notice within which to accept the proposal made by Lessor.  </LI></P>

<LI><P Align="Justify">In the event Lessee does not accept the proposal by Lessor, then Lessor agrees it will not lease the Offered Suite to another sublessee on terms that are substantially more favorable than those proposed to Lessee without first offering the more favorable terms to Lessee and allowing Lessee five (5) business days within which to accept the more favorable terms.  </LI></P>

<LI><P Align="Justify">In the event Lessee fails to accept the proposal from Lessor to sublease the Offered Suite, then with respect to the Offered Suite, Lessee's rights under this Section 11 shall be void and Lessor shall have no further obligation to Lessee with respect to the Offered Suite.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Default</B></U>. There shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (a) if Lessee shall default in the payment of any Rent hereunder and such default shall continue for a period of ten (10) days, (b) if Lessee shall default in the performance of any of the other covenants herein and such default shall continue uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Lessee by Lessor, or (c) if Lessee ceases doing business as a going concern, or if a petition is filed by or against Lessee under the Bankruptcy Code or any amendment thereto (including a petition for reorganization, arrangement or an extension), or if Lessee attempts to remove or sell or transfer or encumber or sublet or part with possession of the Leased Equipment or any part thereof. In the event of a breach of this Agreement, as herein defined: (x) the Leased Equipment shall upon Lessor's demand forthwith be delivered to Lessor at Lessee's expense at such place as Lessor shall designate and Lessor and/or its agents may, without notice or liability or legal process, enter into any Premises of or under control or jurisdiction of Lessee or any agent of Lessee where the Leased Equipment may be or by Lessor is believed to be, and repossess all or any part of the Leased Equipment, disconnecting and separating all thereof from any other property and using all reasonable force necessary or permitted by applicable law to do so, and (y) all sums due and to become due hereunder shall, at Lessor's option, become payable forthwith. The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights given to the Lessor by such statute to recover for any amounts allowed thereby. Lessor, upon any breach of this Agreement, may sell the Leased Equipment or may re-lease such Leased Equipment for a term and a rental which may be equal to, greater than or less than the rental and term herein provided. The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to Lessor's right to recover or prove in full damages for unpaid Rent that accrued prior to the breach of the Agreement. In the event of a breach of this Agreement, Lessor, at its option, may enforce by appropriate legal proceedings specific performance of the applicable covenants of this Agreement as well as any other remedy herein provided.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Indemnity</B></U>.  Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Lessor harmless from any and all liability, costs, expense, loss, damage,  causes of action, suits, claims or judgments arising from injury to person or property resulting from or based upon the use of the Premises and/or actual or alleged use, operation, delivery or transportation of  any or all of the Leased Equipment or its location or condition, but excluding, however, any claims for injury solely caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, its agents, servants, employees, invitees, or contractors.  Lessee shall, at its own cost and expense, defend any and all suits which may be brought against Lessor, either alone or in conjunction with others upon any such liability or claim or claims and shall satisfy, pay and discharge any and all judgments and fines that may be recovered against Lessor in any such action or actions, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Lessor shall give Lessee written notice of any such claim or demand.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Assignment</B></U>. This Agreement and all rights of Lessor hereunder shall be assignable by Lessor without Lessee's consent, but Lessee shall not be obligated to any assignee of the Lessor except after written notice of such assignment from the Lessor. Without the prior written consent of Lessor, the Lessee shall not assign this Agreement or its interests hereunder or enter into any sublease with respect to the Leased Equipment covered hereby, it being agreed Lessor will not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment of this Agreement or sublease of the Leased Equipment.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 14 to the contrary, Lessee shall have the right to assign this Agreement or sublease the Leased Equipment, or any part thereof, to an &quot;Affiliate&quot; without the prior written consent of Lessor, upon at least ten (10) business days prior written notice to Lessor in the case of a subletting to an Affiliate and upon written notice given no more than ten (10) days after closure of the affiliation transaction, in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate.  For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;Affiliate&quot; shall mean any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with (directly or indirectly) Lessee, including, without limitation, any parent corporation controlling Lessee or any subsidiary that Lessee controls or any entity resulting from any consolidation, merger, sale or reorganization of Lessee with another entity or the sale of all or substantially all of Lessee's assets or of all or substantially all of the interests (whether partnership, stock or otherwise) in Lessee.  The term &quot;control,&quot; as used herein, shall mean the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the controlled entity through the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities in such controlled entity.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Further Assurances</B></U>.  Lessee shall execute and deliver to Lessor, upon Lessor's request, such instruments and assurances as Lessor deems necessary or advisable.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Notices, Remedies and Waivers</B></U>.  All notices, demands, requests, advices or designations which may be or are required to be given by either party to the other hereunder shall be in writing.

Each notice, request, demand advice or designation referred to in this section shall be deemed received on the date of the personal service or mailing thereof in the manner herein provided, as the case may be. No remedy of Lessor hereunder shall be exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law provided, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy. A waiver of a default shall not be a waiver of any other or a subsequent default.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Counterparts</B></U>.  This Agreement may be signed simultaneously in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original (including copies sent to a party by facsimile transmission), but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  </LI></P>

<B><U><LI><P Align="Justify">Entire Agreement</B></U>.  The terms and conditions hereof relating to the subject matter described herein (i) constitute the entire agreement and understanding between Lessor and Lessee, (ii) supersede all prior agreements, and understandings, written or oral, between Lessor and Lessee, and (iii) may not be modified or amended except by an instrument mutually executed and delivered by Lessor and Lessee.  </LI></P>
