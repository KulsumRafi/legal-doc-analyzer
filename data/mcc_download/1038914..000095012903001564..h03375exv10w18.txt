      year of three hundred and sixty (360) days, and be compounded monthly.

5.3   BUSINESS DAYS. If a payment under this Sub-Lease is due on a day which is
      not a Business Day, the due date for that payment shall instead be the
      next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the
      preceding Business Day (if there is not).

5.4   VAT. All payments due to the Sub-Lessor under this Sub-Lease are
      calculated without regard to VAT which, if applicable, will be added at
      the appropriate rate. If any VAT is due, the Sub-Lessee shall pay to the
      Sub-Lessor such VAT together with any interest and penalties thereon on
      demand by the Sub-Lessor, such demand to be made no earlier than such date
      as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the VAT to be paid on the last
      date for the payment of such VAT to avoid incurring interest and
      penalties. The Sub-Lessor shall promptly provide the Sub-Lessee with a
      valid VAT invoice in respect of each supply made under this Sub-Lease by
      the Sub-Lessor and such invoice shall comply with all relevant laws and
      regulations relating to VAT (including, in particular, Part III of the
      Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (as amended)).

5.5   INCORRECT VAT. If the Sub-Lessee pays the Sub-Lessor an amount in respect
      of VAT under Clause 5.4 (VAT) and HM Customs and Excise ("CUSTOMS") rules
      that all or part of it was not properly chargeable (an "INCORRECT VAT
      CHARGE") the party receiving the ruling shall immediately notify the other
      of it and, the Sub-Lessor shall pay to the Sub-Lessee no later than five
      (5) Business Days after such notification an amount equal to that
      incorrect VAT charge together with any interest paid by Customs in respect
      of such Incorrect VAT Charge.

5.6   AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY SUB-LESSEE. All amounts payable by the Sub-Lessee under
      this Lease by way of indemnity or reimbursement of any Losses, Taxes and
      the like incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person are payable in the
      currency in which the Loss, Tax or other like amount was incurred or
      suffered.

5.7   CURRENCY. All other amounts payable under this Lease are, except as
      otherwise provided in this Lease, payable in Dollars and shall be made for
      value on the due date.

5.8   TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Punctual payment of amounts due from the Sub-Lessee
      and timely performance by the Sub-Lessee of each of its obligations under
      this Sub-Lease shall, subject to any time periods specified in paragraph
      (a) or (c) of Clause 13.1 (Termination Events) be of the essence and are
      conditions of this Sub-Lease.

5.9   PAYMENTS UNCONDITIONAL. The Sub-Lessee's obligation to pay Rentals and
      make other payments, and perform any obligations owed to the Sub-Lessor
      pursuant to or in connection with this Sub-Lease shall be absolute and
      unconditional and shall not be affected by and shall be irrespective of
      any contingency whatsoever including (but not limited to):

(a)   any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defence, deduction or
      other right;

(b)   any unavailability of the Rig for any reason, including, but not limited
      to, requisition thereof, or any prohibition or interruption of or other
      restriction against the Sub-Lessor's, the Sub-Lessee's, the Charterer's or
      any other person's use, operation or possession of the Rig, any
      interference with such use, operation or possession or failure to deliver
      any part of the Rig or any lack or invalidity of title or any other defect
      in the title, suitability, seaworthiness, satisfactory quality,
      merchantability, fitness for any purpose, condition, appearance, safety,
      design, or operation of any kind or nature of the Rig, or the


                                       13
<PAGE>

      ineligibility of the Rig for any particular use or trade, or for want of
      registration or the absence or withdrawal of any permit, licence,
      authorisation or other documentation required under the applicable law of
      any relevant jurisdiction for the ownership, leasing, use, operation or
      location of the Rig, or (subject to Clause 11.3 (Confirmation of Sub-Lease
      Period)) the Total Loss of, or any damage to, the Rig or any part thereof;

(c)   any insolvency, bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, reorganisation,
      reconstruction, arrangement, readjustment or rescheduling of debt,
      dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings by or against the
      Sub-Lessor, the Sub-Lessee, the Guarantor, the Sub-Lessor Parent or any
      other person (whether a party to any Lease Document or not);

(d)   any validity or unenforceability or lack of due authorisation of, or other
      defect in, this Sub-Lease or any of the other Lease Documents or any
      particular provision hereof or thereof;

(e)   any failure or delay on the part of any party, whether with or without
      fault on its part, duly to perform or comply with its obligations under
      this Sub-Lease or any of the other Lease Documents; and

(f)   any other case which but for this provision would or might have the effect
      of terminating or in any way affecting any obligation of the Sub-Lessee
      hereunder,

      (but without prejudice to the rights of the Sub-Lessee to damages or
      specific performance or any other injunctive relief in respect of this
      Sub-Lease or any of the other Lease Documents).

6     WITHHOLDING

6.1   PAYMENTS. All sums payable to the Sub-Lessor pursuant to or in connection
      with this Sub-Lease and any other Lease Document or any other document
      contemplated by or entered into pursuant to either the Sub-Lease or any
      other Lease Document as appropriate shall be paid free and clear of all
      deductions or withholdings whatsoever in respect of Taxes unless required
      by applicable law.

6.2   GROSS-UP. If the Sub-Lessee is required by applicable law to make a
      deduction or withholding in respect of Taxes from any amount due under
      this Sub-Lease the Sub-Lessee shall:

      (a)   ensure or procure that the deduction or withholding is made and that
            it does not exceed the minimum legal requirement therefor;

      (b)   pay, or procure the payment of the full amount deducted or withheld
            to the relevant Taxation or other authority in accordance with the
            applicable law;

      (c)   and such deduction or withholding arises as a result of (x) a Change
            of law, or (y) the Rig being or becoming a Fixture, increase the
            payment in respect of which the deduction or withholding is required
            so that the net amount received by the Sub-Lessor after the
            deduction or withholding (and after taking account of any further
            deduction or withholding which is required to be made which arises
            as a consequence of the increase) shall be equal to the amount which
            the Sub-Lessor would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
            any requirement to make a deduction or withholding; and

(d)   promptly deliver or procure the delivery to the Sub-Lessor of appropriate
      receipts evidencing the deduction or withholding which has been made;

      PROVIDED THAT if the Sub-Lessor determines, in its absolute discretion,
      that it has received, realised, utilised and retained a Tax benefit by
      reason of any deduction or withholding in


                                       14
<PAGE>

      respect of which the Sub-Lessee has made an increased payment under this
      Clause 6.2, the Sub-Lessor shall, provided it has received all amounts
      which are then due and payable by the Sub-Lessee under any of the
      provisions of this Sub-Lease, pay to the Sub-Lessee (to the extent that
      Sub-Lessor can do so without prejudicing the amount of that benefit and
      the right of the Sub-Lessor to obtain any other benefit, relief or
      allowance which may be available to it) such amount, if any, as the
      Sub-Lessor in its absolute discretion, shall determine will leave the
      Sub-Lessor in no better and no worse position than the Sub-Lessor would
      have been in if the deduction or withholding had not been required;

      PROVIDED FURTHER THAT:

      (i)   the Sub-Lessor shall have an absolute discretion as to the time at
            which and the order and manner in which it realises or utilises any
            Tax benefit;

      (ii)  the Sub-Lessor shall not be obliged to disclose any information
            regarding its business, Tax affairs or Tax computations or those of
            any member of the Sub-Lessor Group;

      (iii) if the Sub-Lessor has made a payment to the Sub-Lessee pursuant to
            this Clause 6.2 on account of any Tax benefit and it subsequently
            transpires that the Sub-Lessor did not receive that Tax benefit, or
            received a lesser Tax benefit, the Sub-Lessee shall pay on demand to
            the Sub-Lessor such sum as the Sub-Lessor may, in its absolute
            discretion, determine is necessary to restore the after-Tax position
            of the Sub-Lessor to that which it would have been had no adjustment
            under this proviso (iii) been necessary;

      (iv)  the Sub-Lessor shall not be obliged to make any payment under this
            Clause 6.2 if, by doing so, it would contravene the terms of any
            applicable law or any notice, direction or requirement of any
            governmental or regulatory authority (whether or not having the
            force of law),

6.3   TREATY RELIEF. If the Sub-Lessee requests the Sub-Lessor, in writing, to
      make an appropriate application in writing to an appropriate Tax authority
      pursuant to the provisions of a double tax treaty for relief (whether in
      whole or in part) in respect of any deduction or withholding on account of
      Taxes required by law, the Sub-Lessor shall, PROVIDED THAT the Sub-Lessor
      is indemnified to its satisfaction in respect of any costs, expenses,
      damages or claims it may incur or suffer in connection therewith, take
      such action as the Sub-Lessee shall reasonably request to make such
      application to an applicable Tax authority. The Sub-Lessor shall be under
      no obligation to appeal, contest or dispute any decision, ruling or
      determination by that Tax authority that the provisions of the double tax
      treaty in respect of which the application referred to in this Clause is
      made do not apply to the deduction or withholding on account of Taxes in
      respect of which that application is made. If the Sub-Lessor subsequently
      obtains a repayment (whether in whole or in part) of such deduction or
      withholding from that Tax authority in circumstances where Sub-Lessee has
      made an increased payment under Clause 6.2 the Sub-Lessor shall, provided
      that the Sub-Lessor has received all amounts which are then due and
      payable by the Sub-Lessee under any of the provision of this Sub-Lease pay
      to the Sub-Lessee such amount of the repayment as the Sub-Lessor
      considers, in its absolute discretion, will leave the Sub-Lessor in no
      worse position than the Sub-Lessor would have been in if the deduction or
      withholding had not been required.

7     LOCATION, USE AND MAINTENANCE OF RIG

7.1   LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF THE RIG.

(a)   The Sub-Lessee will not move the Rig outside the UKCS (except as may be
      required for repair and maintenance) without the prior written consent of
      the Sub-Lessor, such consent


                                       15
<PAGE>

      not to be unreasonably withheld in the case of re-deployment of the Rig to
      another sector of the North Sea which (in respect of operational,
      environmental and pollution liabilities) the Sub-Lessor considers, acting
      reasonably, creates no materially greater risk of potential liability for
      the Sub-Lessor than that of the UKCS at the time of such proposed
      re-deployment.

(b)   Subject to Clause 7.1(a), the Sub-Lessee shall notify the Sub-Lessor at
      least thirty (30) days before moving the Rig from the territorial waters
      of UKCS (or from any other location to which the Rig may be moved
      following a notification to the Sub-Lessor pursuant to this Clause
      7.1(b)), such notification to specify the place to which the Rig is to be
      moved and the jurisdictions through which the Rig will pass in its
      proposed voyage.

(c)   On reasonable request from time to time, the Sub-Lessee shall provide
      written confirmation to the Sub-Lessor of the current location of the Rig.

7.2   MAINTENANCE. The Sub-Lessee shall throughout the Sub-Lease Period maintain
      the Rig in good working order and fit for the purpose for which it is
      employed and shall carry out all necessary maintenance and repair in
      accordance with the GSF Standard.

7.3   SAFETY AND OPERATION. The Sub-Lessee shall take such steps as are
      reasonably practicable to ensure that the Rig and all constituent parts
      thereof will be safe and without risk to health when in use and that the
      Rig is not operated beyond its specified or recommended limits or
      capacity. To this end and without prejudice to the generality of the
      foregoing, the Sub-Lessee shall ensure that any defects in the Rig which
      could be or cause a danger to safety and a risk to health are repaired and
      made good in accordance with the GSF Standard. For this purpose the
      Sub-Lessee shall cause the Rig to be inspected regularly and its various
      systems tested PROVIDED THAT such inspection and testing will only be
      carried out in accordance with and at the interval specified in the
      Sub-Lessee's maintenance schedule for the Rig and otherwise in accordance
      with the GSF Standard. The Sub-Lessee shall also take all steps to ensure
      that appropriate safety measures are adopted and all provisions of all
      applicable laws, codes and regulations relating to the Rig are complied
      with.

7.4   AUTHORISATIONS. The Sub-Lessee shall obtain and keep in full force and
      effect throughout the Sub-Lease Period, at no cost to the Sub-Lessor, all
      permissions, licences and other authorisations which may from time to time
      be required in connection with the ownership, possession, use or operation
      of the Rig.

7.5   COSTS AND EXPENSES. the Sub-Lessee will ensure that throughout the
      Sub-Lease Period and subject to Clause 8.4 (Notification), all debts,
      costs, expenses, losses, liabilities, premiums, calls, contributions,
      penalties, charges, fines, recourses, duties, Taxes, rents, rates, and
      registration charges and other outgoings which during the Sub-Lease Period
      give or may give rise to any Encumbrance (other than any Permitted
      Encumbrances) are promptly paid in full in relation to the Rig.

7.6   MANAGEMENT OF THE RIG. The Rig will at all times be managed in accordance
      with the GSF Standard.

7.7   ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. The Sub-Lessee will and will procure that the Operator
      will:

(a)   comply with all Environmental Laws which are applicable to the Rig,
      (including, without limitation, obtaining, complying with and maintaining
      in full force and effect all Environmental Permits required from time to
      time and all requirements relating to manning, submission of oil spill
      response plans and designation of qualified individuals) which might
      reasonably be expected to, or failure to comply with or maintain might,
      have a material adverse effect on the rights or interests of the
      Sub-Lessor (it being acknowledged that without prejudice to the generality
      of the foregoing, if the same would


                                       16
<PAGE>

      involve the Sub-Lessor in any material civil liability or any criminal
      liability, then the same shall be deemed to materially and adversely
      affect the rights and interests of the Sub-Lessor) or on the ability of
      the Sub-Lessee to fulfil its obligations under the Lease Documents;

(b)   conduct and complete all reasonably necessary investigations, studies,
      sampling, audits and testings required in connection with any known (or
      threatened) material Release of Hazardous Materials; and

(c)   promptly upon the occurrence of any of the following events, provide to
      the Sub-Lessor a certificate specifying in detail the nature of the event
      concerned:

      (i)   the receipt of any Environmental Claim (made or threatened) against
            the Rig, the Sub-Lessor, the Sub-Lessee or the Operator or which is
            in relation to or is caused by or is in connection with the Rig and
            which the Lessee is obliged under any applicable law to report to
            any Governmental Entity; and

      (ii)  any revocation, suspension, amendment, variation, withdrawal or
            refusal to grant any Environmental Permit or any requirement
            relating to manning, submission of oil response plans and
            designation of qualified individuals; or

      (iii) any (or any threatened) material release of Hazardous Materials,

      which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect of
      the nature referred to in paragraph (a) above.

7.8   OBSTRUCTION. The Sub-Lessee shall pay all charges and expenses of every
      kind and nature whatsoever incidental to the use and operation of the Rig
      and, if the Rig or any part thereof becomes a wreck or an obstruction to
      navigation, any costs and expenses arising which may be incurred by or
      made or asserted against the Sub-Lessor in connection with or as a
      consequence of the removal or destruction of the wreck or obstruction. The
      Sub-Lessee shall be entitled to take action to contest or avoid any
      charges or expenses subject to and in accordance with Clause 14.4 (Defence
      of Claims), mutatis mutandis.

7.9   PERFORMANCE. For as long as the Rig is subject to the Charter or
      thereafter sub-chartered to any member of the Guarantor's Group, the
      Sub-Lessee will procure that the Charterer or any future sub-charterer, as
      the case may be, will perform the obligations of the Sub-Lessee under this
      Sub-Lease which relates to operational, maintenance and management issues.
      Such performance will constitute pro tanto satisfaction of the
      Sub-Lessee's obligations under this Sub-Lease. For the avoidance of doubt,
      this Clause 7.9 shall not operate to waive or impair any obligation of the
      Sub-Lessee under this Sub-Lease, which shall continue in full force and
      effect.

7.10  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  The Sub-Lessee will:

(a)   ensure that the Rig is used solely in the conduct of its or the Operator's
      business in compliance with all applicable laws, treaties or conventions
      (and all rules and regulations issued thereunder), including but not
      limited to the ISM Code to the extent applicable and all Environmental
      Laws ("APPLICABLE LAWS") and will ensure that the Rig complies with all
      Applicable Laws; and

(b)   not cause or permit the Rig to be:

      (i)   operated in any manner contrary to any Applicable Law; or

(b)   (or, as the case may be, shall procure that there is provided to the
      Sub-Lessor) such reasonably available financial information relating to
      the Sub-Lessee as the Sub-Lessor may reasonably request from time to time.

7.12  SUB-CHARTERING.

(a)   The Sub-Lessee shall be entitled to sub-lease or sub-charter the Rig to
      any person or otherwise employ the Rig without the prior consent of the
      Sub-Lessor.

(b)   The sub-leasing, sub-chartering or other employment of the Rig by the
      Sub-Lessee to any person will not in any way release the Sub-Lessee from
      its obligations under this Agreement or the other Lease Documents.

8     PROTECTION OF THE SUB-LESSOR'S INTERESTS

8.1   NO AUTHORITY TO CREATE ENCUMBRANCES. The Sub-Lessee will not and will
      procure that each of the Charterer and any other Operator will not:

(a)   pledge the credit of the Sub-Lessor or any member of the Sub-Lessor Group
      for the repair of the Rig or otherwise;

(b)   create, purport to create or, subject to Clause 8.2 (Arrest or Detention),
      permit to subsist any Encumbrance on, over or with respect to the Rig
      (other than Permitted Encumbrances);

(c)   sell, attempt to sell or, otherwise dispose of, the Rig or any interest
      therein, or purport so to do without the previous written consent of the
      Sub-Lessor or unless the requirements of Clause 22.2 are satisfied; or

(d)   part with possession of the Rig other than in accordance with Clause 7.12
      (Sub-chartering) and except as may be required for repair and maintenance.

8.2   ARREST AND DETENTION. If the Rig is at any time during the Sub-Lease
      Period:

(a)   arrested, seized, taken into custody or otherwise detained by any person
      or by any court or other tribunal or by any Governmental Entity (other
      than by a Compulsory Acquisition or any requisition for hire or by reason
      of a Sub-Lessor's Encumbrance); or

(b)   subjected to distress or other legal proceedings by reason of any process,
      claim, the exercise of any rights conferred by an Encumbrance or by any
      other action whatsoever (other than by reason of a Sub-Lessor's
      Encumbrance),

      the Sub-Lessee shall procure the release of the Rig from such arrest,
      seizure or detention within twenty-one (21) days of receiving notice
      thereof by providing bail or otherwise as the circumstances may require.
      The Sub-Lessor acknowledges and accepts that the Sub-Lessee shall, unless
      and until a Termination Event shall have occurred which is continuing,
      have the sole right to contest any litigation, arbitration or
      administrative proceedings in respect of the foregoing subject to and in
      accordance with Clause 14.4 (Defence of Claims), mutatis mutandis.

8.3   INFORMATION CONCERNING THE RIG. The Sub-Lessee undertakes with the
      Sub-Lessor that, from the Start Date and throughout the Sub-Lease Period
      it will promptly furnish the Sub-Lessor with all such information as the
      Sub-Lessor may from time to time reasonably request in writing regarding
      the Rig, its insurance, condition, maintenance, position and employment.


                                       18
<PAGE>

8.4   NOTIFICATION. The Sub-Lessee shall notify the Sub-Lessor in writing
      promptly at the Sub-Lessee's cost and expense of:

(a)   any occurrence in consequence whereof the Rig has become or is, in the
      reasonable opinion of the Sub-Lessee, likely to become a Total Loss;

(b)   any material assistance which has been given to the Rig which has resulted
      or may result in a lien for salvage being acquired over the Rig;

(c)   the requisition for hire, requisition for title, sequestration,
      forfeiture, any Compulsory Acquisition whatsoever, hijacking, theft,
      seizure or detention at any time of the Rig; and

(d)   any event which occurs in connection with the Rig which, in the reasonable
      opinion of the Sub-Lessee, affects or might affect the rights of the
      Sub-Lessor in the Rig or involves or might involve any material loss or
      liability to or of the Sub-Lessor.

8.5   NOTICE OF LEASE. The Sub-Lessee shall place and keep or procure that there
      is placed and kept prominently displayed in the control room of the Rig
      throughout the Sub-Lease Period a framed printed notice in plain type in
      English of such size that the paragraph of reading matter shall cover a
      space of not less than six (6) inches wide by nine (9) inches high,
      reading substantially as follows:

      "NOTICE OF LEASE"

      "This Rig is the property of GlobalSantaFe Drilling Company (North Sea)
      Limited (in such capacity, the "LESSOR") and is subject to a head lease
      granted by the Lessor to Sogelease B.V. (the "LESSEE"). This Rig is
      subject to a sub-lease granted by the Lessee to GlobalSantaFe Drilling
      Company (North Sea) Limited (in such capacity, the "SUB-LESSEE").

      Neither the Lessor, the Sub-Lessee, nor any manager, nor any servant or
      agent of them has any authority whatsoever to contract on behalf of the
      Lessee or to pledge the credit of the Lessee or the involvement of the
      Lessee in any liability whatsoever.

      Under the terms of the Head-Lease and the Sub-Lease the Lessee has no
      operational responsibility for the Rig."

      The Sub-Lessee undertakes not to remove or cover up that notice.

8.6   PRIORITY. The Sub-Lessee hereby covenants that it will procure that its
      obligations under the Lease Documents will rank at least pari passu with
      its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations,
      except for those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law in
      England.

8.7   NOTIFICATION OF TERMINATION EVENT. The Sub-Lessee undertakes with the
      Sub-Lessor that, from the date of this Sub-Lease and throughout the
      Sub-Lease Period, to promptly notify the Sub-Lessor of the occurrence of
      any Termination Event or any event which would with the lapse of time or
      giving of any notice result in a Termination Event promptly upon becoming

      delivery of or failure to deliver the Rig, any defect or deficiency in, or
      inadequacy or unsuitability of, the Rig (or any part thereof) or its use,
      performance, servicing or repair; PROVIDED THAT nothing contained herein

      that they have each carefully considered this Clause 9 (Exclusion of
      Liability) and the exclusions and limitations contained within it and the

      whatever kind which shall deprive the Sub-Lessee of the use, possession or
      enjoyment thereof.

11.2  TOTAL LOSS.

      Sub-Lessee's obligation to pay future Rentals under this Sub-Lease, save
      as otherwise provided in this Sub-Lease shall cease on the Total Loss
      Payment Date (without prejudice to the obligations of the Sub-Lessee to
      pay to the Sub-Lessor all sums which are then due and unpaid or which may
      become due or be ascertained under any paragraph of the Financial
      Schedule) and the Sub-Lessee shall on the Total Loss Payment Date pay to
      the Sub-Lessor an amount as rental which is the aggregate of the
      Termination Sum for the Total Loss Payment Date and all other moneys due
      and payable by the Sub-Lessee under the terms of this Sub-Lease.

            time) on the actual date and at the time the Rig was lost or, if
            such date is not known, on the day on which the Rig was last
            reported;

      (ii)  in the case of a constructive total loss of the Rig, upon the date
            and at the time notice of abandonment of the Rig is given to the
            insurers of the Rig for the time being (provided a claim for such
            constructive total loss is admitted by the insurers) or, if the
            insurers do not admit such a claim, at the date and at the time at
            which a constructive total loss is subsequently adjudged by a
            competent court of law to have occurred;

      (iii) in the case of a compromised or arranged total loss, on the date
            upon which a binding agreement as to such compromised or arranged
            total loss has been entered into by the insurers of the Rig;

      (iv)  in the case of Compulsory Acquisition, on the date upon which the
            relevant requisition of title or other compulsory acquisition
            occurs; and

      (v)   in the case of hijacking, theft, condemnation, confiscation,
            capture, detention, seizure of the Rig (other than where the same
            amounts to Compulsory Acquisition of the Rig) by any Governmental
            Entity, or by persons purporting to act on behalf of any
            Governmental Entity, which deprives the Sub-Lessee of the use of the
            Rig for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days, upon the expiry
            of the period of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date
            upon which the relevant hijacking, theft, condemnation,
            confiscation, capture, detention or seizure occurred.

11.3  CONTINUATION OF SUB-LEASE PERIOD. The Sub-Lessee shall continue to pay
      Rental on the days and in the amounts required under this Lease
      notwithstanding that the Rig shall become a Total Loss, or if for any
      reason the Sub-Lessee shall be permanently deprived of her use prior to
      the end of the Sub-Lease Period, PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT no further
      instalments of Rental shall become due and payable after the date on which
      all sums due


                                       23
<PAGE>

      under Clause 11.2(a) shall have been paid in full and the Sub-Lease Period
      shall terminate on the date of such final payment.

(a)   The Sub-Lessee shall have the sole right to determine whether or not a
      case has arisen for the giving of notice of abandonment to abandon the Rig
      to the insurers and/or claim a constructive total loss and the Sub-Lessee
      is hereby irrevocably authorised by the Sub-Lessor to give the same if it
      so determines.

(b)   The Sub-Lessor shall upon the request of the Sub-Lessee promptly execute
      such documents as may be required to enable the Sub-Lessee to abandon the
      Rig to the insurers and/or claim a constructive total loss and the
      Sub-Lessor shall give the Sub-Lessee all reasonable assistance within its
      power in pursuing the said claim. The Sub-Lessee shall indemnify and hold
      harmless the Sub-Lessor in respect of all Losses, costs and expenses
      incurred by the Sub-Lessor pursuant to this Clause 11.5 (b).

11.6  REQUISITION FOR HIRE

(a)   If the Rig is requisitioned for hire by any Governmental Entity during the
      Sub-Lease Period then, unless and until the Rig becomes a Total Loss
      following such requisition and the Sub-Lessee shall have made payment of
      all sums due pursuant to Clause 11.2 (Total Loss), the lease of the Rig to
      the Sub-Lessee under this Sub-Lease shall continue in full force and
      effect (subject always to the provisions of Clauses 11.2 (Total Loss) and
      13 (Termination)) for the remainder of the Lease Period and the Sub-Lessee
      shall remain fully responsible for the due compliance with all its
      obligations under this Sub-Lease other than such obligations which the
      Sub-Lessee is unable to comply with solely by virtue of such requisition.

      requisition hire paid to the Sub-Lessor or the Sub-Lessee on account of
      such requisition and the Sub-Lessor shall account to the Sub-Lessee for
      any such requisition hire paid to it.

(c)   The Sub-Lessee shall, as soon as practicable after the end of any
      requisition for hire, which terminates before the expiry of the Sub-Lease
      Period, cause the Rig to be put into the condition required by this
      Sub-Lease, and where that requisition shall end after the expiry or
      termination of the Sub-Lease Period the Sub-Lessee shall, as soon as
      practicable, cause the Rig to be put into the re-delivery condition
      required by Clause 13.1(b), allowance being made for fair wear and tear in
      respect of the period from the expiry or termination of the Sub-Lease
      Period.

(d)   Should the Rig be under requisition for hire at the end of the Sub-Lease
      Period:

      (i)   the lease of the Rig under this Sub-Lease shall (unless otherwise
            agreed between the parties hereto) nevertheless be terminated at
            such end but without prejudice to the accrued rights of the parties
            and PROVIDED THAT no Termination Event shall have occurred and be
            continuing in which case the Sub-Lessor shall be entitled to retain
            the requisition hire to the extent of any payments that are then due
            and payable by the Sub-Lessee to the Sub-Lessor under this Sub-Lease
            and the Sub-Lessee's obligations to make such payments shall be pro
            tanto reduced by the amount of such retention and any remaining

            reason of the requisition hire from re-delivering the Rig under
            Clause 13.1 (Termination Events) be excused from its obligation to
            do so.

(e)   If the Rig is requisitioned for hire the Sub-Lessee hereby agrees to

(l)   the sub-Lessee fails to comply with its obligations to issue a Voluntary
      Termination Notice in accordance with Clause 13.4(c) or Clause 13.7

13.2  NATURE OF TERMINATION EVENTS. The occurrence of a Termination Event,
      comprising a failure by the Sub-Lessee to comply with any of the
      provisions of a Lease Document, shall go to the root of this Sub-Lease and
      accordingly shall constitute a breach of condition which the Sub-Lessor
      may treat as a repudiation by the Sub-Lessee of this Sub-Lease. Otherwise
      a Termination Event shall constitute an agreed event giving rise to the
      Sub-Lessor's right to terminate.

13.3  CONSEQUENCES OF SERVICE OF A TERMINATION NOTICE

(a)   If by reason of the occurrence of a Termination Event the Sub-Lessor shall
      have served a Termination Notice on the Sub-Lessee, then both the
      Sub-Lessor's consent to the Sub-Lessee's possession of the Rig and the
      leasing of the Rig under this Sub-Lease shall terminate on the Leasing
      Termination Date and the provisions of Clause 12.1 shall apply.

(b)   The remedies set forth in this Clause 13.3 are not exclusive, and the
      Sub-Lessor shall be entitled to any other remedy available to the
      Sub-Lessor at law or in equity, and the Sub-Lessee shall be liable for all
      legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by reason of the
      occurrence of any Termination Event or the exercise of the Sub-Lessor's
      remedies with respect thereto.

13.4  ILLEGALITY

(a)   If a Change of Law shall render unenforceable any of the obligations of
      any party to this Sub-Lease or any other Lease Document or makes it
      unlawful (i) for any party to any Lease Document to perform their
      respective obligations or (ii) for any such party substantially to give
      effect to their respective rights under this Sub-Lease or any other Lease
      Document entered into by it, the Sub-Lessee and the Sub-Lessor shall
      notify the other party thereof as soon as practicable after becoming aware
      thereof.

(b)   Following such notification by one party to the other, the Sub-Lessor and
      the Sub-Lessee shall discuss in good faith as to how the effects of any
      such Change of Law might be avoided so as to render the relevant
      obligations enforceable or permit the parties thereto to perform their
      obligations hereunder or thereunder or, as the case may be, to permit such
      parties substantially to give effect to their respective obligations under
      this Sub-Lease or any other Lease Document in a manner which is not
      unlawful.

(c)   If such discussions are entered into but, within thirty (30) days of
      notice being given by the affected party, or such shorter period as may be
      permitted by such law, order, regulation or official directive, or such
      change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, the
      Sub-Lessor and the Sub-Lessee have not completed such arrangements as may
      be required to avoid the effect of any such Change of Law, then the
      Sub-Lessor shall be entitled by notice to the Sub-Lessee to require the
      Sub-Lessee to terminate the Sub-Lease Period under Clause 13.5 and the
      Sub-Lessee shall, forthwith upon receipt of such notice, issue a Voluntary
      Termination Notice having as its expiry date the date of issue of such
      Voluntary Termination Notice.

13.5  VOLUNTARY TERMINATION


                                       28
<PAGE>

(a)   The Sub-Lessee shall, subject as provided below, be entitled at any time
      to give and, in the circumstances referred to in Clause 13.4 (a), the
      Sub-Lessee shall be required to give, in each case to the Sub-Lessor an
      irrevocable written notice (the "VOLUNTARY TERMINATION NOTICE")
      terminating the leasing of the Rig under this Sub-Lease with effect from
      the Leasing Termination Date. Any voluntary Termination Notice which is
      given by the Sub-Lessee shall expire (the date of such expiry being the
      Leasing Termination Date) not less than ten (10) days after receipt of the
      same by the Sub-Lessor or, in either such case, on such earlier date as
      may be required by Clause 13.4 (c) and shall not be valid if, when issued
      by the Sub-Lessee in exercise of its entitlement so to do (rather than
      where required so to do) a Termination Event shall have occurred and be
      continuing on the date of the Voluntary Termination Notice.

(b)   If the Sub-Lessee gives a Voluntary Termination Notice, the leasing of the
      Rig shall terminate on the Leasing Termination Date and the provisions of
      Clause 12 (Return and sale of the Rig) shall apply.

(c)   No sale pursuant to the provisions of the Head-Lease following a
      termination pursuant to this Clause 13.5 shall be completed (and no
      contract for sale shall be executed) unless either the Sub-Lessor has
      received all amounts due and payable under this Sub-Lease or the
      Sub-Lessor is satisfied that, upon completion of the sale, the Sub-Lessor
      shall receive all amounts due and owing from the Sub-Lessee to the
      Sub-Lessor upon the termination of the leasing of the Rig in accordance
      with the provisons of this Sub-Lease (including the Financial Schedule).

13.6  PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION. Where the Sub-Lease Period is to terminate in
      accordance with the provisions of this Sub-Lease on the Leasing
      Termination Date by reason of the service of a Termination Notice or a
      Voluntary Termination Notice, the obligation of the Sub-Lessee to pay
      Rental under Clause 4 (Rentals) which would fall due after the Termination
      Payment Date shall cease (notwithstanding the continuation of the
      sub-leasing of the Rig until the Leasing Termination Date) and the
      Sub-Lessee shall (without prejudice to the obligations of the Sub-Lessee
      pursuant to any other provision hereof or of any other Lease Document to
      pay to the Sub-Lessor all sums which are due at the date of termination of
      the leasing of the Rig or may become due to the Sub-Lessor or be
      ascertained after such date) pay to the Sub-Lessor on the Termination
      Payment Date a sum equal to the Termination Sum together with all other
      sums then due to the Sub-Lessor hereunder PROVIDED THAT if but for the
      preceding provisions of this Clause 13.6, there would have occurred in the
      period from and including the date of service of a Termination Notice or,
      as the case may be, a Voluntary Termination Notice to and including the
      Termination Payment Date, a date which would have been a date for the
      payment of Rental under this Sub-Lease the Sub-Lessee shall on such date
      pay to the Sub-Lessor as rental (as part of the Sub-Lessor's compensation
      for early termination) an amount equal to the Rental which, but for the
      preceding provisions of this Clause 13.6, would have been payable on such
      date. Any amount so paid shall be in addition to any amounts payable by
      the Sub-Lessee to the Sub-Lessor on the Termination Payment Date pursuant
      to paragraph 2 (Termination Payment) of the Financial Schedule.

13.7  MANDATORY VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. Upon the Sub-Lessor notifying the
      Sub-Lessee in writing that:

(a)   a Total Loss has occurred in respect of the Rig;

(b)   an Environmental Claim, which is not frivolous or vexatious in the
      reasonable opinion of the Sub-Lessor, has been made in respect of the Rig
      in excess of fifty million Dollars (US$50,000,000);

(c)   an Environmental Claim, which is not frivolous or vexatious in the
      reasonable opinion of the Sub-Lessor, has been made in respect of the Rig
      against the Sub-Lessor or any other member of the Sub-Lessor's Group,


                                       29
<PAGE>

the Sub-Lessee shall, forthwith upon receipt of such notice, issue a Voluntary
Termination Notice having as its expiry date the date of issue of such Voluntary
Termination Notice.

            part thereof) is in the possession or control of the Sub-Lessee, the

            same is in the United Kingdom waters or abroad;

      (ii)  arising directly or indirectly out of or in any way connected with
            any Release or the threatened Release of a Hazardous Material, any

            design or other proprietary right;

            representations on the part of any person (other than the
            Sub-Lessor) made in this Sub-Lease or in any of the other Lease
            Documents being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever (even
            if not a Termination Event) when made;

      (vi)  as a consequence of the occurrence of a Termination Event and/or the

      indemnified (each of the above being referred to as a "LIABILITY").

(b)   Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of Clause 14.1(a),

      Entities or other bodies whether corporate or otherwise) who have incurred
      expenditure in taking preventative measures against loss or damage or have
      suffered or allege that they have suffered loss, damage or injury in

            formal or informal arrangement, and whether or not any such formal
            or informal arrangement existed at the time the Liability was

14.2  EXCLUSIONS FROM GENERAL INDEMNITY. The indemnities contained in Clause
      14.1 (General Indemnity) shall not extend to any Liability:

(a)   to the extent that such Liability is caused by any act of an Indemnified
      Person which constitutes the wilful misconduct or reckless disregard with
      knowledge of the probable consequences;

(b)   to the extent that such Liability is caused by any failure on the part of
      the Sub-Lessor to comply with any of its express and specific obligations
      under any of the Lease Documents to which the Sub-Lessor is party;

(c)   to the extent that such Liability constitutes any amounts in respect of
      Premium or Rentals payable by the Sub-Lessor under the Head-Lease;

(d)   to the extent that such Liability constitutes a cost which is expressly to
      be borne by the Sub-Lessor under any other provision of this Sub-Lease or
      the other Lease Documents and which the Sub-Lessee establishes was not
      intended to be within the scope of the


                                       31
<PAGE>

      indemnities granted in favour of the Sub-Lessor or any other Indemnified
      Person in any Lease Document;

(e)   in respect of which the Sub-Lessor is expressly and specifically
      indemnified under any other provision of this Sub-Lease.

14.3  NOTIFICATION OF INDEMNITY CLAIMS. Without prejudice to the provisions of
      this Clause 14 and without limiting in any way whatsoever, or being a
      condition precedent or subsequent to, the indemnities in favour of any
      Indemnified Person hereunder or prompt payment thereunder, the Sub-Lessor
      shall:

(a)   notify the Sub-Lessee in writing as soon as practicable after receipt by
      the Sub-Lessor of notice of a Liability (provided such notice is in
      writing). Such notification to the Sub-Lessee from the Sub-Lessor shall
      give such details as the Sub-Lessor then has and which are in all the
      circumstances reasonable having regard to the contents of the notice of a
      Liability received by the Sub-Lessor; and

(b)   subject to Clause 14.4 (Defence of Claims), notify the Sub-Lessee of the
      Sub-Lessor's intention to pay or procure the payment of any moneys in
      respect of any such Liability before any such payment is made.

14.4  DEFENCE OF CLAIMS. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Clause 14,
      the Sub-Lessee shall (subject to having first obtained the consent of the
      relevant insurers, if any, and complying in all respects with its
      obligations under this Sub-Lease and provided no Termination Event has
      occurred and is continuing) be entitled to take (at its own cost) such
      actions as the Sub-Lessee reasonably considers necessary to defend or
      avoid any liability arising in respect of a Liability including legal
      proceedings against any third party in respect of a Liability, but subject
      always to the Sub-Lessor first being indemnified to its satisfaction by
      the Sub-Lessee and/or the Guarantor against all potential losses, costs,
      damages and expenses which may be incurred or suffered by the Sub-Lessor
      in connection with any such action, provided always that the Sub-Lessee
      shall not be entitled to take any such action and shall cease taking such
      action and shall settle any Liability if the Sub-Lessor considers (in its
      reasonable opinion) that taking or continuing such action would be likely
      to (i) require the Sub-Lessor to disclose any information or documentation
      which the Sub-Lessor considers, in its reasonable opinion, to be
      confidential (ii) be harmful to the Sub-Lessor's reputation as a financial
      institution, (iii) involve it in any unlawful act or activity or any act
      or activity that is contrary to any law applicable to the Sub-Lessor or
      (iv) cause the Sub-Lessor to breach any other obligation to which it is
      subject whether under the Lease Documents or otherwise.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 14.4, the
      Sub-Lessee shall not be entitled to take or continue any action in the
      name of the Sub-Lessor which it may otherwise be entitled to take under
      this Clause 14.4 without the prior written consent of the Sub-Lessor, such
      consent not to be unreasonably withheld or withdrawn, provided always that
      it shall be reasonable for the Sub-Lessor to withhold its consent or
      withdraw its consent once given if the Sub-Lessor determines that the use
      of its name in connection with such action would be likely to (a) be
      harmful to the Sub-Lessor Parent's reputation as a financial institution
      (such determination to be made in the Sub-Lessor's absolute discretion) or
      (b) (i) otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of the
      Sub-Lessor or (ii) involve the Sub-Lessor in any unlawful act or activity
      or any act or activity that is contrary to any law applicable to the
      Sub-Lessor or (iii) cause the Sub-Lessor to breach any other obligation to
      which it is subject whether under the Lease Documents or otherwise (any
      such determination to be made in the reasonable opinion of the
      Sub-Lessor)).

      The Sub-Lessor and the Sub-Lessee will co-operate and consult in good
      faith in relation to the matters referred to in this Clause 14.4. In
      particular, but without limitation, the Sub-Lessee will keep the
      Sub-Lessor fully informed in respect of any proceedings which the


                                       32
<PAGE>

      Sub-Lessee is conducting in the name of the Sub-Lessor and will provide
      the Sub-Lessor with copies of any and all documentation connected with any
      such proceedings.

14.5  CURRENCY INDEMNITY

(a)   If the Sub-Lessor or any other Indemnified Person receives an amount in
      respect of the liability of the Sub-Lessee under this Sub-Lease or any
      other Lease Document or if that liability is converted into a claim,
      proof, judgment or order in a currency other than the currency (the
      "CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY") in which the amount is expressed to be payable
      under this Sub-Lease or the relevant other Lease Document:

      (i)   the Sub-Lessee shall indemnify the Sub-Lessor or the relevant
            Indemnified Person as an independent obligation against any loss or
            liability arising out of or as a result of the conversion;

      (ii)  if the amount received by the Sub-Lessor or the relevant Indemnified
            Person, when converted into the contractual currency at the
            Sub-Lessor Parent's spot rate of exchange on the relevant date, is
            less than the amount owed in the contractual currency, the
            Sub-Lessee shall forthwith on demand pay to the Sub-Lessor or the
            relevant Indemnified Person an amount in the contractual currency
            equal to the deficit; and

      (iii) the Sub-Lessee shall pay to the Sub-Lessor or the relevant
            Indemnified Person concerned on demand any exchange costs and taxes
            payable in connection with any such conversion.

(b)   The Sub-Lessee waives any right it may have in any jurisdiction to pay any
      amount under this Sub-Lease or any other Lease Document in a currency
      other than that in which it is expressed to be payable.

14.6  RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES. If any Indemnified Person shall recover
      from or be paid by, any person (other than the Sub-Lessee, the Guarantor
      or any other member of the Guarantor's Group) any amount in respect of any
      payments paid or discharged by the Sub-Lessee in accordance with this
      Clause 14, then PROVIDED THAT the Sub-Lessor has received payment of such
      amount and is satisfied, in its absolute discretion, that such amount is
      unconditionally available for retention by the Sub-Lessor, the Sub-Lessor
      shall pay to the Sub-Lessee a sum equal to the value of such recovered or
      paid amount together with any interest actually earned on such recovered
      or paid amount (less the amount of any tax payable thereon).

14.7  PASS THROUGH OF INDEMNITY BENEFITS. Where in this Clause 14 an indemnity
      is expressed to be for the benefit of any person who is not a party to
      this Sub-Lease the Sub-Lessor shall be entitled to indemnify such person
      on the same terms (and subject in particular to Clause 14.4 (Defence of
      Claims)) mutatis mutandis as the indemnities expressed to be for the
      benefit of such person in this Clause 14 and the Sub-Lessee shall
      indemnify the Sub-Lessor and hold the Sub-Lessor harmless on a full
      indemnity basis from and against each amount paid or payable by the
      Sub-Lessor to such person under any such indemnity.

14.8  PRESERVATION OF INDEMNITIES

(a)   Without prejudice to any right to damages or other claim which any party
      may, at any time, have against another under this Sub-Lease or under any
      of the Lease Documents it is hereby agreed and declared that the
      indemnities in favour of the Sub-Lessor and the other Indemnified Persons
      by the Sub-Lessee contained in this Sub-Lease or any of the Lease
      Documents shall continue in full force and effect subject to and in
      accordance with their terms notwithstanding the termination of the leasing
      of the Rig under this Sub-Lease, any sale or other disposition of the Rig,
      Total Loss or any breach of the terms hereof or thereof by the Sub-Lessee
      (including fundamental breach) or the lawful


                                       33
<PAGE>

      repudiation by the Sub-Lessor of this Sub-Lease or any of the Lease
      Documents or any other circumstances whatsoever.

(b)   If any payment received by the Sub-Lessor or an Indemnified Person in
      respect of moneys owing or due and payable by the Sub-Lessee hereunder
      shall on the subsequent liquidation or other insolvency of the Sub-Lessee
      be avoided under any laws relating to insolvency or liquidation, such
      payment shall not be considered as discharging or diminishing the
      liability of the Sub-Lessee under this Sub-Lease and the other Lease
      Documents and this Sub-Lease and the other Lease Documents shall continue
      to apply as if such payment had at all times remained owing by the
      Sub-Lessee.

15    COSTS, EXPENSES AND FEES

15.1  COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Sub-Lessee shall pay, on demand, the amount of all
      costs and expenses:

(a)   subject to the separately agreed cap, reasonably incurred by the
      Sub-Lessor in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution
      of the Lease Documents;

(b)   reasonably incurred by the Sub-Lessor, in connection with any amendments,
      waivers or consents under or in respect of this Sub-Lease or the other
      Lease Documents instigated by the Sub-Lessee (whether or not such
      amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective) (including but not limited
      to reasonable legal fees); and

(c)   incurred by the Sub-Lessor in enforcing or defending or attempting to
      enforce or defend (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any
      rights under this Sub-Lease or any other Lease Document.

16    TAX INDEMNITY

16.1  INDEMNITY. Subject to Clause 16.4 (Exclusions), the Sub-Lessee shall on
      demand indemnify the Sub-Lessor and keep the Sub-Lessor fully indemnified
      against any Tax Liability imposed on or payable by the Sub-Lessor or any
      Indemnified Person which arises or becomes payable at any time in respect
      of, by reference to or arising out of:

(a)   the operation of the Rig; and

(b)   the Rig being or becoming a Fixture.

16.2  MOVEMENT OF RIG. The Sub-Lessee hereby indemnifies the Sub-Lessor and
      shall keep the Sub-Lessor fully indemnified against any Tax Liability
      imposed on or payable by the Sub-Lessor or any Indemnified Person which
      arises or becomes payable at any time in respect of, by reference to or
      arising out of:

(a)   the movement or location of the Rig;

(b)   the existence of the Rig outside the UKCS; or

(c)   the residence, domicile or activities of the Sub-Lessee or any member of
      the Guarantor's Group;

      which arise as a result of or by reference to the Sub-Lessee moving the
      Rig outside the UKCS with or (without prejudice to the provisions of
      Clause 7.1 (Location and Movement of the Rig) and the Sub-Lessor's
      remedies for any breach of that Clause) without the prior written consent
      of the Sub-Lessor.


                                       34
<PAGE>

16.3  INCREMENTAL TAX LIABILITY. Any Tax Liability referred to in clauses 16.1
      (Indemnity) and 16.2 (Movement of the Rig) shall be an "INCREMENTAL TAX
      LIABILITY" for the purposes of this Sub-Lease.

16.4  EXCLUSIONS. Subject to Clause 16.8 (Indemnity payments), the Sub-Lessee
      shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be obliged to indemnify the
      Sub-Lessor pursuant to Clause 16.1 (Indemnity) and 16.2 (Movement of the
      Rig):

(a)   against any incremental Tax Liability in any relevant jurisdiction
      attributable to the Rentals or Termination Sum actually receivable
      hereunder or to any other amounts payable to the Sub-Lessor under the
      Lease Documents;

(b)   against any incremental Tax Liability to the extent it arises owing to the
      Sub-Lessor knowingly failing to file Tax returns or the Sub-Lessor
      knowingly failing to make a payment of Taxes which are due and payable
      assessed on the Sub-Lessor which knowing failure has not been consented to
      in writing, or requested in writing by the Sub-Lessee except where such
      knowing failure by the Sub-Lessor arises from a failure by the Sub-Lessee
      promptly to provide the Sub-Lessor with correct, suitable and adequate
      information to the extent that the Sub-Lessee is (or, but for any
      fraudulent or negligent defaults on its part, would have been) in a
      position to provide such information following receipt by the Sub-Lessee
      of a written request from the Sub-Lessor setting out full details of such
      information to enable the Sub-Lessor to file the relevant Tax return or
      pay such Taxes.

16.5  STAMP DUTIES. All stamp, documentary, registration or other like duties or
      Taxes, including any penalties, additions, fines, surcharges or interest
      relating thereto, which are imposed on or chargeable on or in connection
      with this Sub-Lease or any of the other Lease Documents shall be paid by
      the Sub-Lessee (whether or not the primary responsibility of the
      Sub-Lessee) PROVIDED THAT the Sub-Lessor shall be entitled but not obliged
      to pay any such duties or Taxes, whether or not they are its primary
      responsibility, whereupon the Sub-Lessee shall on demand indemnify the
      Sub-Lessor against those duties or Taxes. The Sub-Lessor agrees that if it
      decides to pay any such duties or Taxes, it shall give the Sub-Lessee not
      less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice before making such payment
      (unless a Termination Event has occurred and is continuing or the
      Sub-Lessor is legally required to make payment earlier).

16.6  PAYMENTS. Any payment to be made under Clause 16.1 (Indemnity) shall be
      made:

(a)   in the case of a Tax Liability within paragraph (a) of the Tax Liability
      definition or, in the case of the set-off of a right to repayment within
      paragraph (c) of the Tax Liability definition, no later than two Business
      Days prior to the last date on which the payment of Tax can be made
      without incurring interest or penalties, and

(b)   in the case of a Tax Liability within paragraph (b) of the Tax Liability
      definition, no later than the last date on which a payment of Tax which
      would not have been due but for the loss or use of the Relief as referred
      to in that paragraph (b) can be made without incurring interest or
      penalties,

      and in any other case, or, if later, five (5) Business Days after the date
      on which notice of the incremental Tax Liability is given to the
      Sub-Lessee.

16.7  NOTICE. If the Sub-Lessor receives notice of an incremental Tax Liability
      it shall promptly give written notice to the Sub-Lessee and shall provide
      the Sub-Lessee with reasonable details of the nature and quantum of the
      incremental Tax Liability.


                                       35
<PAGE>

16.8  INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. If and to the extent that any sums payable by the
      Sub-Lessee under this Sub-Lease by way of indemnity or reimbursement prove
      to be insufficient, by reason of Taxes suffered thereon, for the
      Sub-Lessor or an Indemnified Person to discharge its relevant liability or
      to reimburse the Sub-Lessor or an Indemnified Person for the cost incurred
      by it in discharging such liability, the Sub-Lessee will on demand pay to
      the Sub-Lessor, or the Sub-Lessor for the benefit of such Indemnified
      Person, such additional sum as (after taking into account any Taxes
      suffered by the Sub-Lessor and/or the Indemnified Person thereon) is
      required to indemnify on an after-Tax basis the Sub-Lessor or, as the case
      may be, the Indemnified Person in respect of such insufficiency.

16.9  MITIGATION. In the event of a Change of Law or in the event of any Tax
      Liability arising which was not contemplated by the parties on entry into
      this Agreement, any of the other Lease Documents or any transaction or
      document contemplated herein or therein, the Sub-Lessor and the Sub-Lessee
      hereby agree to co-operate in good faith to seek to mitigate or eliminate
      any adverse consequences of such Change of Law or such Tax Liability,
      including without limitation by way of amendment or revision to this
      Sub-Lease, any of the other Lease Documents or any transaction or document
      contemplated herein or therein or otherwise restructuring the transaction
      contemplated by the Lease Documents.

17    INCREASED COSTS

17.1  INCREASED COSTS. This Clause 17 applies if at any time the Sub-Lessor
      notifies the Sub-Lessee that it considers that as a result of:

(a)   any Change of Law; or

(b)   the effect of complying with any regulation (including any which relates
      to capital adequacy or liquidity controls or which affects the manner in
      which the Sub-Lessor is obliged to allocate capital resources) which is
      introduced, or altered, or the interpretation or application of which is
      altered, after the date of this Sub-Lease,

      the Sub-Lessor or any member of the Sub-lessor's Group has incurred or
      will incur an "INCREASED COST".

17.2  MEANING OF "INCREASED COST". In this Clause 17, "INCREASED COST" means, in
      relation to the Sub-Lessor or any member of the Sub-lessor's Group:

(a)   an additional or increased cost incurred directly as a result of, or in
      connection with, the Sub-Lessor having entered into, or being a party to,
      the Lease Documents or funding, maintaining or performing its obligations
      under the Lease Documents; or a reduction in the amount of any payment to
      the Sub-Lessor under any of the Lease Documents or in the effective return
      which such a payment represents to the Sub-Lessor or on its capital; or

(b)   an additional or increased cost of funding all or maintaining all or any
      of the Sub-Lessor's liabilities under the Head-Lease; or

(c)   a liability to make a payment, or a return foregone, which is calculated
      by reference to any amounts received or receivable by the Sub-Lessor under
      this Sub-Lease or any of the other Lease Documents;

      but not an item directly covered by the current capital adequacy
      regulations in force on the date of this Sub-Lease which include (but are
      not limited to) the matters set out in the initial statement of the Basle
      Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory


                                       36
<PAGE>

      Practices dated July 1988 and entitled "International Convergence of
      Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" (the "BASLE ACCORD").

      For the avoidance of doubt, any item arising from matters set out in the
      new Basle Accord (expected in 2007) in the form finally implemented by the
      applicable authorities ("BASLE II") shall count as increased costs for the
      purpose of this Clause to the extent and according to the timetable
      provided for. Without prejudice to the Sub-Lessor's right to use this
      Clause to claim an increased cost the Sub-Lessor will consult with the
      Sub-Lessee in good faith and in a timely manner in relation to the
      implementation and effect of Basle II insofar as the same relates to
      Increased Costs within this Clause 17.

17.3  PAYMENT OF INCREASED COSTS. The Sub-Lessee shall pay to the Sub-Lessor the
      amounts which the Sub-Lessor from time to time notifies the Sub-Lessee
      that it has determined is necessary to compensate it for the increased
      cost. The Sub-Lessor shall provide the Sub-Lessee with reasonable detail
      of the basis on which it seeks to recover any amount in respect of an
      increased cost.

17.4  MITIGATION. If circumstances arise which would result in notification
      under Clause 17.1(Increased Costs) then, without limiting the rights of
      the Sub-Lessor under Clause 17.3 (Payment of Increased Costs), the
      Sub-Lessor shall use its reasonable endeavours to take such reasonable
      steps as may be open to it to mitigate or remove those circumstances
      PROVIDED THAT the Sub-Lessor shall be under no obligation to take any such
      steps which shall or might be considered likely in the Sub-Lessor's
      opinion to:

(a)   have an adverse effect in the Sub-Lessor's business operations, financial
      condition or reputation;

(b)   involve the Sub-Lessor in any activity which is unlawful or prohibited or
      any activity which is contrary to, or inconsistent with, any regulation;
      or

(c)   involve it in any expense (unless indemnified to its satisfaction) or Tax
      disadvantage.

18    RELEASE FROM ARREST

18.1  RELEASE FROM ARREST: SUB-LESSOR'S VESSELS. If any vessel which is for the
      time being owned (in whole or in part) by or leased to the Sub-Lessor
      shall at any time have a writ or libel filed against it or be arrested,
      attached or levied upon pursuant to any legal process or purported legal
      process or is detained in exercise or purported exercise of any
      Encumbrance or claim of whatsoever nature, arising out of the use or
      operation of the Rig or out of the use or operation of any other rig
      vessel owned by or leased or chartered to the Sub-Lessee or any other
      member of the Guarantor's Group, except where that Encumbrance or claim
      arises as a result of any act or omission of the Sub-Lessor (but excluding
      for this purpose any act or omission relating to the operation of the Rig
      for which the Sub-Lessee is responsible pursuant to this Sub-Lease or any
      act or omission consequent upon an act or omission of the Sub-Lessee or
      any other member of the Guarantor's Group):

(a)   the Sub-Lessee forthwith upon receiving notice thereof at its expense
      shall procure the release of such vessel from such arrest, detention,
      attachment or levy or, as the case may be, the discharge of the writ or
      libel by providing bail or procuring the provision of security or
      otherwise as the circumstances may require; and


                                       37
<PAGE>

(b)   the Sub-Lessee shall be responsible for discharging each and every
      liability in connection with any such process, claim, Encumbrance or other
      action.

      Without prejudice to the generality of the other indemnities contained in
      this Sub-Lease, should any such other vessel owned by or leased to the
      Sub-Lessor be arrested, detained, attached or levied upon or be the
      subject of a writ or libel in such circumstances, the Sub-Lessee shall
      indemnify the Sub-Lessor against all claims made on the Sub-Lessor by the
      charterers of such other vessel or any other party in connection with such
      arrest, detention, attachment, levy, writ or libel.

18.2  RELEASE FROM ARREST: SUB-LESSEE'S VESSELS. If:

(a)   the Rig or any other rig or vessel owned or operated by any member of the
      Guarantor's Group, at any time has a writ or libel filed against it or is
      arrested, attached or levied upon pursuant to any legal process or
      purported legal process or is detained in exercise or purported exercise
      of any Encumbrance or claim of whatsoever nature arising out of the use or
      operation of any other rig or vessel for the time being owned by or leased
      to the Sub-Lessor or any other member of the Sub-Lessor Group and leased
      or chartered by it otherwise than to the Sub-Lessee or to any member of
      the Guarantor's Group; and

(b)   the charterers of such other vessel (being in that situation under
      obligations to the Sub-Lessor equivalent to those assumed by the
      Sub-Lessee under Clause 8.3 (Arrest and Detention)) fail to fulfil those
      obligations,

      PROVIDED THAT the Sub-Lessee shall first have given prior notice thereof
      to the Sub-Lessor and, to the extent practicable, consulted with the
      Sub-Lessor as far in advance as is reasonable in all the circumstances,
      the Sub-Lessee shall:

      (i)   be entitled to act as agent for the Sub-Lessor or the relevant
            member of the Sub-Lessor Group (as the case may be) to procure
            release of the Rig or such other rig or vessel (as the case may
            require) from such arrest, detention, attachment or levy or, as the
            case may be, the discharge of the writ or libel and the discharge of
            all liabilities in connection with such process, claim, lien or
            other action subject to and in accordance with Clause 14.4 (Defence
            of claims), mutatis mutandis; and

      (ii)  be entitled to be indemnified by the Sub-Lessor against claims made
            on the Sub-Lessee by the charterers of such other vessel in
            connection with such arrest, detention, attachment, levy, writ or
            libel and all losses and expenses reasonably and properly incurred
            in connection therewith.

19    RIGHTS AND WAIVERS

19.1  RIGHTS CUMULATIVE. No right or remedy conferred upon the Sub-Lessor or the
      Sub-Lessee by this Sub-Lease shall be exclusive of any right or remedy
      provided by law, and all rights and remedies conferred upon the Sub-Lessor
      or the Sub-Lessee by this Sub-Lease shall be cumulative with, and in
      addition to, its rights under general law and, in particular, shall be
      without prejudice to the Sub-Lessor's or the Sub-Lessee's rights to claim
      damages.

19.2  NO WAIVER. The exercise of any power or remedy or the enforcement of any
      right by the Sub-Lessor or Sub-Lessee shall not be construed as a waiver
      of the right to exercise any other power or remedy or to enforce any other
      right. Any forbearance or indulgence granted by the Sub-Lessor or
      Sub-Lessee shall not constitute a waiver of the right or remedy of the
      Sub-Lessor or Sub-Lessee respectively in respect of which such


                                       38
<PAGE>

      forbearance or indulgence is granted and the Sub-Lessor or Sub-Lessee

(a)   hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
      unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts;

(b)   waives any objections on the grounds of venue or forum non conveniens or
      any similar grounds and agrees that legal proceedings in any one or more
      jurisdictions shall not preclude legal proceedings in any other
      jurisdiction; and

(c)   agrees that final judgment against it in any action or proceedings shall
      be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or
      outside England by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall

            or otherwise documented to the satisfaction of the Sub-Lessor,
            acting reasonably) all the rights and obligations of the Head-Lessor
            under the Head-Lease;

2     TERMINATION PAYMENT

(a)   The Termination Sum shall be payable on the Termination Payment Date or,
      as the case may be, the Total Loss Payment Date and shall be calculated by
      reference to such date and shall be the aggregate of the Actual Balance on
      that date and Broken Funding Costs and any other amounts then payable to
      the Sub-Lessor under the Sub-Lease and other Lease Documents.

(b)   Payments pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall bear interest from the
      Termination Payment Date or, as the case may be, the Total Loss Payment
      Date to the date of actual payment in accordance with Clause 5.2.

(c)   The Sub-Lessee undertakes and agrees to indemnify the Sub-Lessor on demand
      against any cost or detriment (including, without limitation, any damages,
      penalties or premiums incurred by the Sub-Lessor) as reasonably determined
      by the Sub-Lessor and certified to the Sub-Lessee by the Sub-Lessor,
      arising to the Sub-Lessor as a result of the Sub-Lessor repaying prior to
      its specified maturity any funding assumed to be obtained by the
      Sub-Lessor in respect of the Sub-Lessor's obligations in consequence of
      any termination of the Sub-Lease Period ("BROKEN FUNDING Costs"). If in
      consequence of such a repayment having been unconditionally received in
      full a benefit (as reasonably determined by the Sub-Lessor and certified
      to the Sub-Lessee by the Sub-Lessor) accrues to the Sub-Lessor in
      connection with any early repayment of such funding ("BROKEN FUNDING
      BENEFITS"), the Sub-Lessor undertakes to pay the Sub-Lessee promptly an
      amount equal to such benefit. If the Sub-Lessor is unable to repay such
      funding actually entered into by the Sub-Lessor, it shall notify the
      Sub-Lessee of the Sub-Lessor's best estimate in good faith (but which in
      the absence of manifest error shall be final and binding upon the
      Sub-Lessee).

      For the purpose of this paragraph 2(c) it shall be assumed that the
      Sub-Lessor has obtained funding under which interest is paid in advance on
      each Rental Payment Date and is calculated at LIBOR prevailing at the
      commencement of each Rental Period and which does not impose any penalty
      or additional cost other than by reference to the interest differential
      applying in respect of the balance of the current Rental Period in which
      prepayment occurs.
