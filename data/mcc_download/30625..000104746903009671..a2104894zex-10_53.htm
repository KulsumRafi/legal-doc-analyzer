be mentally competent and of age until the Committee receives written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent, and that a guardian, conservator, statutory
committee, or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the Committee finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is unable to
properly care for his affairs, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a
brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the Committee to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. </FONT></P>

jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian or conservator or statutory committee, provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Committee. Any
payment made under the provision of this Section&nbsp;8.2 shall be a complete discharge of liability therefore under the Plan. </FONT></P>

payment of benefits subsequent to such date shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, as they may have been amended, except that any Eligible Executive, beneficiary or survivor
covered by or receiving benefits from the Plan as of such date may elect to have the provisions in effect prior to their amendment apply to him. Subject to the foregoing provision, the Eligible
Executive shall have a contractual right to all benefits applicable to him under the Plan. In the event that an Eligible Executive brings a legal action after a "Change of Control" as defined in
Section&nbsp;2.1(b) to enforce any of his rights hereunder, the Company shall reimburse the eligible Executive for his legal fees and expenses in bringing such action unless it is judicially
determined that such action was frivolous or brought in bad faith. </FONT></P>
