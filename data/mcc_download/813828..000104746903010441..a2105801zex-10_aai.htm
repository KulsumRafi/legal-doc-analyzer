<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
purposes of the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan"), for key personnel of Infinity Broadcasting Corporation ("Corporation") and its subsidiaries
(the Corporation and its subsidiaries severally and collectively referred to in the Plan as the "Company") are to foster and promote the long-term financial success of the Company and
materially increase stockholder value by (i)&nbsp;attracting and retaining key personnel of outstanding ability, (ii)&nbsp;strengthening the Company's capability to develop, maintain and direct a
competent management team, (iii)&nbsp;motivating key personnel, by means of performance-related incentives, to achieve long-range performance goals, (iv)&nbsp;providing incentive
compensation opportunities competitive with those of other major companies and (v)&nbsp;enabling key personnel to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will be administered by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation ("Committee") which will consist of two or more members. Each member will be a
"non-employee director," as that term is defined by Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as such rule may
be amended, or any successor rule, and an "outside director," as that term is defined by Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The members will be appointed by the
Board of Directors, and any vacancy on the Committee will be filled by the Board of Directors or in a manner authorized by the Board. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee will have the sole and complete authority: (i)&nbsp;to select in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.3 persons who will
participate in the Plan ("Participant" or "Participants") (including the right to delegate authority to select as Participants persons who are not required to file reports with respect to securities
of the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;16(a) of the Exchange Act ("Nonreporting Persons")); (ii)&nbsp;to make Awards and payments in such forms and amounts as it may determine (including the
right to delegate authority to make Awards to Nonreporting Persons within limits approved from time to time by the Committee), (iii)&nbsp;to impose such limitations, restrictions and conditions upon
such Awards as the Committee, or, with respect to Awards to Nonreporting Persons, the Committee's authorized delegates, deems appropriate; (iv)&nbsp;to interpret the Plan and the terms of any
document relating to the Plan and to adopt, amend and rescind administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (v)&nbsp;to amend or cancel an existing Award in whole
or in part (including the right to delegate authority to amend or cancel an existing Award to a Nonreporting Person in whole or in part within limits approved from time to time by the Committee),
except that the Committee and its authorized delegates may not, unless otherwise provided in the Plan, or unless the Participant affected thereby consents, take any action under this clause that would
adversely affect the rights of such Participant with respect to the Award, and except that the Committee and its authorized delegates may not, unless otherwise provided in the Plan, take any action to
amend any outstanding Option under the Plan in order to decrease the Option Price under such Option; and (vi)&nbsp;to make all other determinations and to take all other actions necessary or
advisable for the interpretation, implementation and administration of the Plan. The Committee's determinations on matters within its authority will be conclusive and binding upon the Company and all
other persons. </FONT></P>

to purchase Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee may provide with respect to any option to purchase Stock that, if the Participant, while an Eligible Person, exercises the option in whole or in part using already-owned
Stock, the Participant will, subject to this Section&nbsp;2.1 and such other terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Committee, receive an additional option ("Reload Option"). The Reload
Option will be to purchase, at Fair Market Value as of the date the original option was exercised, a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of whole shares used by the Participant to exercise
the original option. The Reload Option will be exercisable only between the date of its grant and the date of expiration of the original option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;A
Reload Option will be subject to such additional terms and conditions as the Committee may approve, which terms may provide that the Committee may cancel the Participant's right to
receive the Reload Option and that the Reload Option will be granted only if the Committee has not canceled such right prior to the exercise of the original option. Such terms may also provide that,
upon the exercise by a Participant of a Reload Option while an Eligible Person, an additional Reload Option will be granted with respect to the number of whole shares used to exercise the first Reload
Option. </FONT></P>

accelerate the time at which all or any part of the Option may be exercised. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee will establish procedures governing the exercise of options and will require that notice of exercise be given. Stock purchased on exercise of an option must be paid for

so provided in the Stock Option Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in Article&nbsp;VII of the Plan), the Company

Section&nbsp;2.6 (or the entire Option if no part of the Option has yet been exercised) in exchange for a payment in cash of an amount equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the

Control which is in effect at any time during the period beginning on the sixtieth (60<SUP>th</SUP>) day prior to the date on which the Company exercises such right and ending on the date on which
the Company exercises such right. For purposes of this definition, if the consideration paid or to be paid in any such Change in Control consists, in whole or in part, of consideration other than
cash, then the Board will take such action as in its judgment it deems appropriate to establish the cash value of such consideration. </FONT></P>

whole or in part by reference to appreciation in Stock value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, an SAR entitles the Participant to receive, with respect to each share of Stock as to which the SAR is exercised, the excess of the share's Fair Market Value on the date
of exercise over its Fair Market Value on the date the SAR was granted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;SARs
may be granted in tandem with options granted under the Plan ("Tandem SARS") or independently of Options ("Independent SARs"). An SAR granted in tandem with an NSO may be granted

as otherwise provided herein, a Tandem SAR will be exercisable only at the same time and to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as the Option related thereto is
exercisable, and the Committee may prescribe additional conditions and limitations on the exercise of the SAR. The exercise of a Tandem SAR will cancel the related Option. Tandem SARs may be exercised
only when the Fair Market Value of Stock to which it relates exceeds the Option Price. </FONT></P>

made to the Participant at a subsequent time. No such limitation will require a Participant to return to the Company any amount theretofore received by him or her upon the exercise of an SAR. </FONT></P>

Stock. If and to the extent that such withholding is required, the Committee may permit the Participant or such other person to elect at such time and in such manner as the Committee provides to have
the Company hold back from the shares to be delivered, or to deliver to the Company, Stock having a value calculated to satisfy the statutory withholding requirement. In the alternative, the Committee
