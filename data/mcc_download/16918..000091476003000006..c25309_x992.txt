         (a)      each of the conditions precedent to funding under the Credit
                  Facilities (other than any conditions relating to the approval
                  of the Transaction by the BRL Hardy Shareholders or by the
                  Supreme Court of South Australia) is satisfied or waived; or

         (b)      any Person (other than Constellation or an Affiliate or
                  Constellation) acquires a Relevant Interest in at least 15% of
                  the share capital of BRL Hardy; or

         (c)      a Third Party Proposal is announced which has the support of
                  the BRL Hardy Board or which is otherwise reasonably likely to
                  be consummated.

5.2      The terms of the BRL Hardy Guarantee must give Constellation the
         unconditional right to call on the BRL Hardy Guarantee if BRL Hardy
         fails to comply with its payment obligations under clauses 4.2 and 4.4.
         The term of such BRL Hardy Guarantee must be for 12 months from the
         date of this deed, provided that BRL Hardy must extend the term of the
         BRL Hardy Guarantee if there is a dispute between BRL Hardy and
         Constellation concerning any payment due under this deed until a date
         which is one month after the date the dispute is resolved. The BRL
         Hardy Guarantee will otherwise be in such form as Constellation and BRL
         Hardy reasonably agree in writing.

5.3      If a dispute arises between BRL Hardy and Constellation as to
         Constellation's rights to compensation under clause 4.2 (a), (c) or (d)
         of this deed, Constellation must not call on the BRL Hardy Guarantee
         until the dispute is resolved in accordance with clause 6 of this deed.
         If a dispute arises between BRL Hardy and Constellation as to
         Constellation's rights to compensation under clause 4.2 (b) of this
         deed, Constellation may notwithstanding such dispute call on the BRL

         Hardy Guarantee immediately after expiry of the period referred to in
         clause 4.4.


5.4      Constellation must return the BRL Hardy Guarantee to BRL Hardy when BRL
         Hardy's obligations under clauses 4.2 and 4.4 have been observed and
         complied with or have otherwise terminated in accordance with this
         deed.

5.5      At any time during the currency of the BRL Hardy Guarantee, BRL Hardy
         may propose to Constellation an alternative security arrangement and
         Constellation will give any such proposal due and reasonable
         consideration. If Constellation accepts the alternative security
         arrangement proposed by BRL Hardy then the BRL Hardy Guarantee must be
         returned to BRL Hardy and the provisions of clauses 5.2 and 5.4 will no
         longer apply.

6.       Disputes

6.1      If a dispute arises between BRL Hardy and Constellation as to either of
         their respective rights to receive compensation under this deed (other
         than a dispute as to the right of Constellation to receive compensation
         under clause 4.2(b)), the dispute must be referred to Queen's Counsel
         or Senior Counsel practising in the field of corporate law in Australia
         (Counsel).

6.2      If the parties do not agree on the Counsel, either party may request
         the president of the Law Society of South Australia (or his or her
         nominee) to nominate the Counsel.

6.3      The Counsel will act as a finder of fact and will not act as an
         arbitrator.

6.4      The decision of the Counsel will be final and binding on the parties.

         time to time).

13.2     If GST is payable in relation to a supply made under or in connection
         with this deed then:

         (a)      any party ("Recipient") that is required to provide
                  consideration to another party ("Supplier") for that supply
                  must pay an additional amount to the Supplier equal to the
                  amount of that GST at the same time as any other consideration
                  is to be first provided for that supply; and

         (b)      the Supplier will provide a tax invoice to the Recipient no
                  later than the time at which any consideration is to be first
