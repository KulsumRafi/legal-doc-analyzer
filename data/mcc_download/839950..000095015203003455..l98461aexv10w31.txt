                        AMENDMENTS TO ORIGINAL AGREEMENT

         ss. 2.1. DEFINED TERM. The definition of the term "CONSOLIDATED EBITDA"
in Section 1.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced with the
following definition of the term "CONSOLIDATED EBITDAX":

         "CONSOLIDATED EBITDAX" means, for each period of four consecutive
         Fiscal Quarters, the sum of (1) the Consolidated Net Income of Borrower
         during such period, plus (2) all interest expense which was deducted in
         determining such Consolidated Net Income, plus (3) all income taxes
         which were deducted in determining such Consolidated Net Income, plus
         (4) all depreciation, amortization (including amortization of good will
         and debt issue costs) and other non-cash charges (including any
         provision for the reduction in the carrying value of assets recorded in
         accordance with GAAP) which were deducted in determining such
         Consolidated Net Income, plus (5) all exploration and abandonment
         expense which were deducted in determining such Consolidated Net
         Income, minus (6) all non-cash items of income which were included in
         determining such Consolidated Net Income.

         ss. 2.2. INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. Section 7.14 of the Original
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

         Section 7.14. INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. At the end of any Fiscal
         Quarter, the ratio of (a) Borrower's Consolidated EBITDAX for the four
         immediately preceding consecutive fiscal quarters to (b) Borrower's
