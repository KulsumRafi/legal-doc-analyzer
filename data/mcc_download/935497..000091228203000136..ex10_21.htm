<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The commission schedule for TSA and
Grintek above aligns with MDSI&#146;s desire to be able to publicly disclose a binding
agreement in accordance with its earnings announcement schedule for the first fiscal
quarter of 2002 or by the date of its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Therefore,
the date of the Closed Customer Contract will be the first date on which both MDSI and TSA
(or Grintek as the case may be) have entered into a legally binding agreement (within the
Net Revenue guidelines described above) and MDSI&#146;s head office has evidence of such
agreements. The agreements may be subject to regulatory approval within South Africa,
(i.e., Industrial Participation, Reserve Bank of SA). Due to the potential material
nature of these agreements, MDSI may be obligated to promptly disclose such agreements to
the financial and investment community. As a result Mastro agrees to use his reasonable
best efforts to have TSA (or Grintek as the case may be) agree to a public announcement of
such agreements coincident with the signing of the applicable legally binding
agreements. If either the TSA or Grintek agreement (as the case may be) is materially
altered in order to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, then the earned commissions
for TSA or Grintek agreement (as the case may be) to be paid to Mastro will be calculated
based on the date such agreement is re-submitted for final regulatory approval. </FONT></P>
