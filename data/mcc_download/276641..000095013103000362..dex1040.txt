     Section 1.3. Monthly Allocation of Finance Charge Receivables. The amount
                  ------------------------------------------------
of Finance Charge Receivables (excluding, in each case where such term is used
in this Section 1.3, Discount Option Receivables) in all Accounts shall be
        -----------
determined as follows:

     (a) At the close of business on each Cycle Billing Date for any Cycle of
which any Accounts are included in the Trust, the amount of Finance Charge
Receivables of all Accounts in such Cycle shall be equal to the result of (A)
the amount of Finance Charges charged to all Accounts in such Cycle on such date
minus (B) the amount of Finance Charge Receivables on all Accounts in such
Billing Cycle that have been charged off since the close of business on the
preceding Cycle Billing Date. As of the end of each Monthly Period, the amount
of Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts shall equal (X) the sum of the
amounts calculated pursuant to the preceding sentence for each Cycle of which
Accounts are included in the Trust during that Monthly Period plus (Y) the
Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount.

     (b) For each Business Day in each Monthly Period, the amount of Collections
allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts shall be all
Collections available for allocation on that Business Day up to an amount equal
to the quotient of the result determined pursuant to paragraph (a) above as of
the end of the immediately preceding Monthly Period divided by the number of
Business Days in such present Monthly Period; provided, however, that (A) the
                                              --------  -------
amount of Collections allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts
on the first Business Day of each Monthly Period shall equal the product of two
times such quotient, (B) subject to clause (C) below, the amount of Collections
allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts on the last Business
Day of each Monthly Period shall equal zero and (C) to the extent that the total
Collections available for allocation on any Business Day (other than the last
Business Day of a Monthly Period) is less than the amount that is to be
allocated to Collections of Finance Charge Receivables on that Business Day,
then the deficit shall be added to the amount of Collections that will be
allocated to Finance Charge Receivables on the next Business Day.

     (c) If, at the close of business on the last Business Day of any Monthly
Period, the amount of Collections allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for
all Accounts during such Monthly Period is less than the amount of Finance
Charge Receivables for all Accounts calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) as of
the end of the next preceding Monthly Period, then such deficit shall be the
"Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount" and shall be added to the amount of Finance
Charge Receivables as of the end of the then current Monthly Period pursuant to
paragraph (a).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may adopt a different method of
determining the amount of Finance Charge Receivables which in the good faith
judgment of the Servicer is designed to more accurately reflect the portions of
Receivables and Collections constituting Finance Charge Receivables.

                           CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

     Section 2.1. Conveyance of Receivables. By execution of this Agreement,
                  -------------------------
Seller does hereby transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the
Issuer, without recourse except as provided herein, all its right, title and
interest in, to and under (a) the Collateral Certificate, and (b) effective on
the FCMT Termination Date, the Receivables existing at the opening of business
on the FCMT Termination Date, and thereafter created from time to time until the

Issuer as provided herein, the rights to receive certain amounts paid or payable
as Interchange (if and to the extent provided for in any Indenture Supplement),
all rights to security for any Receivables (including without limitation rights

Agreement, rights described in clause (a)(ii) of the definition of "Existing
                               --------------
Assets" in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, rights under the Receivables
Purchase Agreement relating to assets that have been transferred or contributed

assets under Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) thereof) and all proceeds thereof and
             ---------------     ------

other property credited to the Collection Account, the Series Accounts and the
Excess Funding Account (including any subaccounts of any such account), the
rights of the Issuer under this Agreement and the Trust Agreement and the right
to receive Recoveries shall constitute the assets of the Issuer (the "Trust
                                                                      -----
Assets"). The foregoing does not constitute and is not intended to result in the
------
creation or assumption by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee
or any Noteholder of any obligation of the Seller, the Servicer or any other
Person in connection with the Accounts or the Receivables or under any agreement
or instrument relating thereto, including any obligation to Obligors, merchant
banks, merchants or clearance systems.

     On or prior to the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to the Owner
Trustee a registered certificate representing the Collateral Certificate. On or
prior to the FCMT Termination Date, Seller agrees to record and file, at its own
expense, financing statements (and continuation statements when applicable) with
respect to the Receivables and other Trust Assets conveyed by Seller existing on
the FCMT Termination Date and thereafter created meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary
to perfect, and maintain the perfection of, the transfer and assignment of its
interest in such Receivables and other Trust Assets to the Issuer, and to
deliver a file stamped copy of each such financing statement or other evidence
of such filing to the Owner Trustee as soon as practicable after the FCMT
Termination Date, and (if any additional filing is so necessary) as soon as
practicable after the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Receivables and
other Trust Assets arising in Additional

                                       3

<PAGE>

Accounts. The Owner Trustee shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file such
financing or continuation statements or to make any other filing under the
applicable UCC in connection with such transfer and assignment.

     Seller further agrees, at its own expense, on or prior to (x) the FCMT
Termination Date, (y) the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional
Accounts (other than Additional Accounts added pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and
                                                           --------------
(z) the applicable Removal Date, in the case of Removed Accounts, (a) to
indicate in the appropriate computer files that Receivables created (or
reassigned, in the case of Removed Accounts) in connection with the Accounts
have been conveyed to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement (or conveyed to
Seller or its designee in accordance with Section 2.7, in the case of Removed
                                          -----------
Accounts) and (b) to deliver to the Owner Trustee a computer file or microfiche
list containing a true and complete list of all such Accounts specifying for
each such Account, as of the FCMT Termination Date, the applicable Addition Date
in the case of Additional Accounts, and the applicable Removal Date in the case
of Removed Accounts, its account number and, the aggregate amount outstanding in
such Account and the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables outstanding in
such Account. Each such file or list, as supplemented, from time to time, to
reflect Additional Accounts and Removed Accounts, shall be marked as Schedule 1
                                                                     ----------
to this Agreement and is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this
Agreement.

     If the arrangements with respect to the Receivables hereunder shall
constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale of such Receivables, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law, and that Seller shall be deemed to have granted
to the Issuer a first priority perfected security interest in all of Seller's
right, title and interest, whether owned on the FCMT Termination Date or
thereafter acquired, in, to and under the Receivables and the other Trust Assets
conveyed by Seller, and all money, accounts, general intangibles, chattel paper,
instruments, documents, goods, investment property, deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit, letters of credit, and advices of credit consisting of,
arising from or related to the Trust Assets, to secure its obligations
hereunder.

     Seller and Servicer acknowledge that all instruments (including
certificates of deposit) and bank accounts the security interest in which has
been transferred to the Issuer hereby and which are maintained with Servicer or
of which Servicer has possession, shall be so maintained and held by Servicer on
behalf and for the benefit of the Issuer, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

     Additionally, for purposes of perfecting the Issuer's security interest in
bank accounts pledged to Seller, which security interest Seller has transferred
to the Issuer hereunder, this Agreement constitutes and shall be deemed (i)
notice to Seller and Servicer by the Issuer of the Issuer's security interest in
such bank accounts, and (ii) Seller's and Servicer's acknowledgment of and
consent to the Issuer's notice and the Issuer's security interest in such bank
accounts.

Issuer pursuant to Section 2.1. The Owner Trustee shall maintain a copy of
                   -----------

----------

     (b) The Owner Trustee hereby agrees not to disclose to any Person any of
the account numbers or other information contained in the computer files or

a Requirement of Law applicable to the Owner Trustee, (ii) in connection with
the performance of the Owner Trustee's or the Issuer's duties hereunder, (iii)

Purchase Agreement. The Owner Trustee and the Issuer each agrees to take such
measures as shall be reasonably requested by Seller to protect and maintain the
security and confidentiality of such information and, in connection therewith,
shall allow Seller or its duly authorized representatives to inspect the Owner
Trustee's security and confidentiality arrangements as they specifically relate
to the administration of the Issuer from time to time during normal business
hours upon prior written notice. The Owner Trustee and the Issuer shall provide
Seller with notice five (5) Business Days prior to disclosure of any information
of the type described in this Section 2.2(b).

                 ---------------------------------------------------------
Agreement and the Receivables.
-----------------------------

     (a) Binding Obligation; Valid Transfer and Security Interest. Seller hereby
         --------------------------------------------------------
represents and warrants as of each date the representations are made or deemed
made in Sections 4.1(e), (j) and (k) of the Receivables Purchase Agreement that
        ---------------  ---     ---
such representations are true and correct. Seller hereby represents and warrants
to the Issuer that, as of the Initial Closing Date and, with respect to any
Series issued after the Initial Closing Date, unless otherwise stated in the
related Indenture Supplement, as of the Closing Date for such Series:

          (i) This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
     of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except
     as such enforceability may be limited by Debtor Relief Laws and except as
     such enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (whether
     considered in a suit at law or in equity).

          (ii) This Agreement constitutes either (A) a valid transfer to the
     Issuer of all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the
     Trust Assets, and such property will be held by the Issuer free and clear
     of any Lien of any Person claiming through or under Seller or its
     Affiliates, except for (w) the interests of the FCMT Trustee, the Indenture
     Trustee and the Noteholders, (x) Liens permitted under Section 2.5(b), (y)
                                                            --------------
     the Seller Interest and (z) Seller's right to receive interest accruing on,
     and investment earnings in respect of, the Collection Account or any Series
     Account as provided in the Transaction Documents or (B) a grant of a
     security interest in such property to the Issuer, which is enforceable with
     respect to (i) upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
     Collateral Certificate, all monies due or to become due with respect
     thereto and other proceeds thereof, (ii) upon the FCMT Termination Date,
     the then existing Receivables, all monies due or to become due with respect
     thereto, the Collections, Recoveries and other proceeds thereof, and
     Insurance Proceeds relating thereto and (iii) thereafter, at the time new
     Receivables arise, with respect to such Receivables, all monies due or to
     become due with respect thereto, and the Collections, Recoveries and other
     proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds relating thereto. If this Agreement
     constitutes the grant of a security interest to the Issuer in such
     property, upon the filing of the financing statements described in Section
                                                                        -------

     and proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds relating to such

                                       7

<PAGE>

     Receivables, as the same arise, the Issuer shall have a first priority
     perfected security interest in such property, except for Liens permitted
     under Section 2.5(b). Neither Seller nor any Person claiming through or
           --------------
     under Seller shall have any claim to or interest in the Collection Account,
     the Excess Funding Account or any Series Account, except for Seller's right
     to receive interest accruing on, and investment earnings in respect of, the
     Collection Account, the Excess Funding Account or any Series Account, as
     provided in the Transaction Documents, Seller's right to receive payments
     from the Collection Account or any Series Account in accordance with the
     provisions of the Indenture, and, if this Agreement constitutes the grant
     of a security interest in such property, except for the interest of Seller
     in such property as a debtor for purposes of the UCC as in effect in the
     applicable jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
     from and after the FCMT Termination Date, the representations and
     warranties specified in Schedule 2 are true and correct.
                             ----------

     (b) Eligibility of Receivables. Seller hereby represents and warrants as of
         --------------------------
each date the representations are made or deemed made in Section 4.1(l) of the
                                                         --------------
Receivables Purchase Agreement (other than the first sentence thereof) that such
representations are true and correct. As of the FCMT Termination Date, Seller
agrees that all representations and warranties made by it with respect to any
Account or Receivable pursuant to Section 2.4 of the Pooling and Servicing
                                  -----------
Agreement shall be deemed for all purposes (including the reassignment
obligations under Section 2.4(e)) to have been made pursuant to this Agreement
                  --------------
as of the day when each was made or deemed made, as if this Agreement had been
in effect on that day. Thereafter, each day on which any new Receivable is
transferred by Seller to the Issuer, Seller shall be deemed to represent and
warrant to the Issuer that (i) each Receivable transferred on such day is an
Eligible Receivable, (ii) each Receivable transferred on such day has been
transferred to the Issuer free and clear of any Lien of any Person (other than
Liens permitted under Section 2.5(b), the Seller Interest and Seller's right to
                      --------------
receive interest accruing on, and investment earnings in respect of, the
Collection Account or any Series Account, as provided in the Transaction
Documents) and in compliance, in all material respects, with all Requirements of
Law applicable to Seller, (iii) with respect to each such Receivable, all
consents, licenses, approvals or authorizations of or registrations or
declarations with any Governmental Authority required to be obtained, effected
or given by Seller in connection with the transfer of such Receivable to the
Issuer have been duly obtained, effected or given and are in full force and
effect and (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.4(a)
                                                                --------------
are true and correct with respect to each Receivable transferred on such day as
if made on such day.

     (c) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth in this
         ----------------
Section 2.4 shall survive the transfer of the respective Receivables to the
-----------
Issuer. Upon discovery by Seller, the Servicer or the Owner Trustee of a breach
of any of the foregoing representations and warranties, the party discovering
such breach shall give prompt written notice to the others and any Enhancement
Provider.

     (d) Reassignment of Ineligible Receivables.
         --------------------------------------

     (i) Reassignment of Receivables. In the event any representation or
         ---------------------------
warranty contained in Section 2.4(b) is not true and correct in any material
                      --------------
respect as of the date specified therein with respect to any Receivable or the
related Account unless cured within sixty (60) days (or such longer period, not
in excess of 120 days, as may be agreed to by the Indenture Trustee) after the
earliest to occur of the discovery thereof by Seller or receipt by Seller of
written notice thereof given by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
Servicer, or the date on which the RPA Seller is required to make any
corresponding purchase under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, then Seller
shall accept reassignment of all Receivables in the related Account ("Ineligible
                                                                      ----------
Receivables") on the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (ii) below.
-----------
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.4(d) to the contrary, in
                                           --------------
the event of breach of any representation and warranty set forth in Section
                                                                    -------
2.4(b) with respect to any Receivable having been conveyed to Seller or the
------
Issuer free and clear of any Lien of any Person claiming through or under Seller
and its Affiliates and in compliance in all material respects with all
Requirements of Law applicable to RPA Seller or Seller, immediately upon the
earlier to occur of the discovery of such breach by Seller or receipt by Seller
of written notice of such breach given by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee or the Servicer, Seller shall repurchase and the Owner Trustee shall
convey, without recourse, representation or warranty, all of the Owner Trustee's
right, title and interest in each Ineligible Receivable, and the Servicer shall
promptly notify the Rating Agencies of such event.

     (ii) Price of Reassignment. The Servicer shall deduct the portion of such
          ---------------------
Ineligible Receivables reassigned to the Seller which are Principal Receivables
from the aggregate amount of the Principal Receivables used to calculate the
Seller Amount and the various Allocation Percentages. If the exclusion of an
Ineligible Receivable from the calculation of the Seller Amount would cause the
Seller Amount to be less than the Minimum Seller Amount, then Seller shall, on
the date of retransfer of such Ineligible Receivable, make a deposit in the
Collection Account (for allocation pursuant to the Indenture) in immediately
available funds in an amount equal to the Shortfall Amount to the extent Seller
has received such funds from RPA Seller under the Receivables Purchase
Agreement, and, if Seller has not received such funds, to the extent Seller has
funds available for such purpose after amounts payable to Securityholders (as
defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement) have been paid in full. The
amounts so deposited are to be treated for all purposes hereof as Collections on
such Ineligible Receivables.

     Upon reassignment of any Ineligible Receivable, the Issuer shall
automatically and without further action be deemed to transfer, assign, set over
and otherwise convey to Seller or its designee, without recourse, representation
or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Issuer in and to such
Ineligible Receivable, all Recoveries related thereto, all monies and amounts
due or to become due and all proceeds thereof and such reassigned Ineligible
Receivable shall be treated by the Issuer as collected in full as of the date on
which it was transferred.

                                       9

<PAGE>

The obligation of Seller to accept reassignment of any Ineligible Receivables
conveyed to the Issuer by Seller, and to make the deposits, if any, required to
be made to the Collection Account as provided in this Section, shall constitute
the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to such obligation available to
the Issuer, the Noteholders (or the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders)
or any Series Enhancer. The Issuer shall execute such documents and instruments
of transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall reasonably be
requested and provided by the Seller to effect the conveyance of such Ineligible
Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.4(d), but only upon receipt of an
                             --------------
Officer's Certificate from Seller that states that all conditions set forth in
Section 2.5 have been satisfied. Each party hereto agrees that the failure by
-----------
the Seller to make the deposit in accordance with this Section 2.4(d) shall not
                                                       --------------
give rise to any claim against the Seller.

     (e) Reassignment of Issuer Portfolio. If any representation or warranty of
         --------------------------------
a Seller set forth in Section 2.4(a) is not true and correct in any material
                      --------------
respect and such breach has a material adverse effect on the Receivables or the
availability of the proceeds thereof to the Issuer (which determination shall be
made without regard to whether funds are then available pursuant to any Series
Enhancement), then either the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
Holders of Notes holding not less than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of
all Outstanding Notes, by notice then given to Seller and the Servicer (and to
the Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee if given by the Noteholders), may direct
Seller to accept a reassignment of the Receivables conveyed to the Issuer by
Seller if such breach and any material adverse effect caused by such breach is
not cured within sixty (60) days of such notice (or within such longer period,
not in excess of 120 days, as may be specified in such notice), and upon those
conditions Seller shall be obligated to accept such reassignment on the terms
set forth below; provided, however, that the Receivables will not be reassigned
                 --------  -------
to Seller if, on any day prior to the end of such 60-day or longer period (i)
the relevant representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
material respects as if made on such day and (ii) Seller shall have delivered to
the Owner Trustee a certificate of an authorized officer describing the nature
of such breach and the manner in which the relevant representation and warranty
has become true and correct.

     Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately available
funds not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Transfer Date for the
first Distribution Date following the Monthly Period in which such reassignment
obligation arises, in payment for such reassignment, an amount equal to the
deposit amount for the reassignment to the extent Seller has received such funds
from RPA Seller under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, and, if Seller has not
received such funds, to the extent Seller has funds available for such purpose
after amounts payable to Securityholders (as defined in the Receivables Purchase
Agreement) have been paid in full. The deposit amount for such reassignment will
be equal to the sum of the amounts specified therefor with respect to each
outstanding Series in the related Indenture Supplement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, such amounts shall be distributed to the
Noteholders on such Distribution Date in accordance with the terms of each
Indenture Supplement. If the

                                       10

<PAGE>

Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders give notice directing
the Seller to accept a reassignment of the Receivables as provided above, the
obligation of Seller to accept such reassignment pursuant to this Section 2.4(e)
                                                                  --------------
and to make the deposit required to be made to the Collection Account as
provided in this paragraph shall constitute the sole remedy respecting an event
of the type specified in the first sentence of this Section 2.4(e) available to
                                                    --------------
the Noteholders (or the Owner Trustee or Indenture Trustee on behalf of the
Noteholders) or any Series Enhancer. Upon reassignment of the Receivables on
such Distribution Date, the Issuer shall automatically and without further
action be deemed to sell, transfer, assign, set-over and otherwise convey to the
Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and
interest of the Issuer in and to the Receivables and Recoveries allocable to the
Issuer, and all monies and amounts due or to become due with respect thereto and
all proceeds thereof. The Issuer shall execute such documents and instruments of
transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall reasonably be
requested by the Seller to effect the conveyance of such property pursuant to
this Section. Each party hereto agrees that the failure by the Seller to make
the deposit in accordance with this Section 2.4(e) shall not give rise to any
                                    --------------
claim against the Seller.

     (f) Seller will not add additional RPA Seller parties to the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, and not become a party to a new receivables purchase
agreement with any party other than FCNB, without first satisfying the Rating
Agency Condition.

     (g) Seller will be adequately capitalized to engage in the transactions
contemplated by its Certificate of Incorporation.

     Section 2.5. Covenants of Seller. Seller hereby covenants that:
                  -------------------

     (a) Receivables to be Accounts. Seller will take no action to cause any
         --------------------------
Receivable to be characterized as anything other than an "account" (as defined
in the UCC as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction). Each Receivable shall
be payable pursuant to a contract which does not create a Lien on any goods
purchased thereunder.

     (b) Security Interests. Except for the transfers hereunder and under the
         ------------------
Transfer and Servicing Agreement, Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or
transfer to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist
any Lien on any Receivable, whether now existing or hereafter transferred to the
Issuer, or any interest therein. Seller will immediately notify the Owner
Trustee of the existence of any Lien on any Receivable; and Seller shall defend
the right, title and interest of the Issuer in, to and under the Receivables,
whether now existing or hereafter transferred to the Issuer, against all claims
of third parties; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall
                  --------  -------                       --------------
prevent or be deemed to prohibit Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the
Receivables any Liens for state, municipal or other local taxes if such taxes
shall not at the time be due and payable or if Seller shall currently be
contesting the validity thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings

                                       11

<PAGE>

and shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto;
provided further, however, that nothing in this Section 2.5(b) shall prevent or
-------- -------  -------                       --------------
be deemed to prohibit Seller from granting a participation interest in the
Seller Interest.

     (c) Account Allocations. If Seller is unable for any reason to transfer
         -------------------
Receivables to the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
(including by reason of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event) then Seller
agrees that, solely for purposes of payments under this Agreement, it shall in
any such event allocate, after the occurrence of such event, payments on each
Account with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the
oldest principal balance of such Account (it being understood that the foregoing
allocation does not affect, with respect to any obligor, the priority of
application of cardholder payments provided for in the related Cardholder
Agreement(s)) and to have such payments applied as Collections in accordance
with the Indenture. The parties hereto agree that Finance Charge Receivables,
whenever created, accrued in respect of Principal Receivables which have been
conveyed to the Issuer, or which would have been conveyed to the Issuer but for
the above described inability to transfer such Receivables, shall continue to be
a part of the Issuer notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer of additional
Principal Receivables to the Issuer and Collections with respect thereto shall
continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with the Indenture.

     (d) Delivery of Collections. Seller agrees to pay to the Servicer (if the
         -----------------------
Servicer is not then First Consumers National Bank) promptly (but in no event
later than two Business Days after receipt) all Collections received by Seller
in respect of the Receivables.

     (e) Finance Charges and Other Fees. Seller agrees that, except as otherwise
         ------------------------------
required by any Requirement of Law or as is deemed by Seller to be advisable for
its MasterCard and VISA programs based on a good faith assessment by Seller of
the various factors impacting the use of its MasterCard and VISA cards, Seller
shall not permit FCNB to reduce at any time (i) the Finance Charges assessed in
respect of any Accounts, or (ii) any other fees charged on any of the Accounts
if, as a result of such reduction, FCNB's reasonable expectation of the
Portfolio Yield in respect of any Series as of such date would be less than the
current Base Rate applicable to such Series.

     (f) Cardholder Agreements and Cardholder Guidelines. Seller agrees to
         -----------------------------------------------
comply with and perform its obligations under the Cardholder Agreements relating
to the Accounts and the Cardholder Guidelines, except insofar as any failure so
to comply or conform would not materially and adversely affect the rights of the
Issuer the Noteholders under the Transaction Documents. In that regard, except
as aforesaid, and so long as such changes are made applicable to the comparable
segments of those MasterCard and VISA accounts owned and serviced by the
Servicer which have characteristics the same as, or substantially similar to,
the Accounts which are subject hereto (if any), Seller shall be free to change
the terms and provisions of such Cardholder Agreements or the Cardholder
Guidelines in any respect (including, without limitation, the calculation of the
amount, or the timing,

                                       12

<PAGE>

of charge offs). FCNB shall provide to each Rating Agency written notice of any
such change that (i) lowers the periodic finance charge rate used to calculate
Finance Charges on any Account or changes the minimum monthly payment applicable
to any Account; (2) changes any periodic finance charge rate used to calculate
Finance Charges on any Account from a floating rate to a fixed rate or from a
fixed rate to a floating rate; (3) reduces any Cardholder Fees, Cash Advance
Fees or other fees applicable to any Account or (4) changes the calculation of
the amount, or the timing, of charge offs.

     (g) Sale Treatment. Seller agrees to treat the conveyance of Receivables
         --------------
hereunder as a sale for accounting purposes.

     (h) Compliance with Law. Seller hereby agrees to comply in all material
         -------------------
respects with all Requirements of Law applicable to Seller.

     (i) Activities of Seller. Seller shall not engage in any business or
         --------------------
activity of any kind or enter into any transaction or indenture, mortgage,
instrument, agreement, contract, lease or other undertaking which is not
directly related to the transactions contemplated and authorized by the
Transaction Documents or which is otherwise a Permitted Transaction.

     (j) Indebtedness. Seller shall not create, incur, assume or suffer to exist
         ------------
any Indebtedness or other liability whatsoever, except (i) obligations incurred
or owing to the Issuer under this Agreement or the Receivables Purchase
Agreement, (ii) liabilities incident to the maintenance of its corporate
existence in good standing and the ownership of the Receivables, (iii)
obligations incident to a Permitted Transaction or (iv) obligations to FCNB or
Spiegel evidenced by a Subordinated Note.

     (k) Guarantees. Seller shall not become or remain liable, directly or
         ----------
contingently, in connection with any Indebtedness or other liability of any
other Person, whether by guarantee, endorsement (other than endorsements of
negotiable instruments for deposit or collection in the ordinary course of
business), agreement to purchase or repurchase, agreement to supply or advance
funds, or otherwise except incident to a Permitted Transaction.

     (l) Investments. Seller shall not make or suffer to exist any loans or
         -----------
advances to, or extend any credit to, or make any investments (by way of
transfer of property, contributions to capital, purchase of stock or securities
or evidences of indebtedness, acquisition of the business or assets, or
otherwise) in, any Person except (i) for purchases of Receivables pursuant to
the Receivables Purchase Agreement, (ii) for investments in Permitted
Investments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (iii) pursuant to
a Permitted Transaction.

     (m) Distributions. Seller shall not declare or pay, directly or indirectly,
         -------------
any dividend or make any other distribution (whether in cash or other property)
with respect to the profits, assets or capital of Seller or any Person's
interest therein, or

                                       13

     The Servicer's expenses include the reasonable fees and disbursements of
independent accountants and all other expenses incurred by the Servicer in
connection with its activities hereunder; provided that the Servicer shall not

termination of the Issuer and the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee.

     Section 5.5. The Servicer Not to Resign. The Servicer shall not resign from
                  --------------------------
the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except upon determination that
(i) the performance of its duties hereunder is or becomes impermissible under
applicable law and (ii) there is no reasonable action which the Servicer could
take to make the performance of its duties hereunder permissible under
applicable law. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the
Servicer shall be evidenced as to clause (i) by an Opinion of Counsel to such
                                  ----------
effect delivered to the Indenture Trustee. No such resignation shall become
effective until the Indenture Trustee or a Successor Servicer shall have assumed
the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer in accordance with Section
                                                                        -------

     Section 5.6. Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding the
                  -------------------------------------------------------------
Receivables. The Servicer shall provide to the Indenture Trustee access to the
-----------
documentation regarding the Accounts and the Receivables in such cases where the
Indenture Trustee is required in connection with the enforcement of the rights
of the Noteholders, or by applicable statutes or regulations to review such
documentation, such access being afforded without charge but only (i) upon
reasonable request, (ii) during normal business hours, (iii) subject to the
Servicer's normal security and confidentiality procedures and (iv) at offices
designated by the Servicer. Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall derogate from the
                                            -----------
obligation of Seller, the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer to observe any
applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding the Obligors and
the failure of the Servicer to provide access as provided in this Section 5.6 as
                                                                  -----------
a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section 5.6.
                                                                  -----------

     Section 5.7. Delegation of Duties. It is understood and agreed by the
                  --------------------
parties hereto that the Servicer may delegate certain of its duties hereunder to
First Data Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation. In addition, in the ordinary
course of business, the Servicer may at any time delegate any duties hereunder
to any other Person who agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with the
Cardholder Guidelines. Any such delegations shall not relieve the Servicer of
its liability and responsibility with respect to such duties, and shall not
constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 5.5. The Servicer shall
                                               -----------
notify each Rating Agency of any material delegation of its duties not
consistent with its normal practices as of the date hereof.

     Section 5.8. Examination of Records. The Servicer shall clearly and
                  ----------------------
unambiguously identify each Account (including any Additional Account designated
pursuant to Section 2.6) in its computer or other records to reflect that the
            -----------
Receivables arising in such Account have been transferred by Seller to the
Issuer pursuant to this Agreement. The Servicer shall, prior to the sale or
transfer to a third party of any

                                       30

receivership or liquidation of such entity's affairs, or notwithstanding an
objection by Seller any such action shall have remained undischarged or unstayed
for a period of sixty (60) days or upon entry of any order or decree providing
for such relief; or Seller shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they become due, file, or consent or fail to object (or object
without dismissal of any such filing within sixty (60) days of such filing) to
the filing of, a petition to take advantage of any Debtor Relief Law, make an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors (any such act or occurrence with

Date:

          (a) any failure by the Servicer to make any payment, transfer or

     Noteholders, which continues unremedied for a period of 60 days after the
     date on which written notice of such failure requiring the same to be
     remedied shall have been given to the Servicer by the Indenture Trustee, or
     to the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee by the Noteholders holding not
     less than 10% of the outstanding principal amount of any Series adversely
     affected thereby and continues to materially adversely affect such
     Noteholders for such period; or the Servicer's delegation of its duties
     under this Agreement except as permitted by Section 5.7; or
                                                 -----------

          (c) any representation, warranty or certification made by the Servicer
     in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
     Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect when made, which has a
     material adverse effect on the rights of the Noteholders and which
     continues to be incorrect in any material respect for a period of 60 days
     after the date on which written notice of such failure requiring the same
     to be remedied shall have been given to the Servicer by the Indenture
     Trustee, or to the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee by the Noteholders
     holding not less than 10% of the outstanding principal amount of any Series
     adversely affected thereby and continues to materially adversely affect
     such Noteholders for such period, or if such failure cannot be cured within
     such 60-day period owing to causes beyond the control of the Servicer, if
     the Servicer shall fail to proceed promptly to cure the same and prosecute

     dismissed within 60 days after its filing; or

          (e) with respect to any Series, any other event specified in the
     Indenture Supplement for such Series,

then, so long as such Servicer Default shall not have been remedied, either the
Indenture Trustee, or the Noteholders holding more than 50% of the Outstanding
Amount, by notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the Indenture
Trustee if given by the Noteholders) (a "Termination Notice"), may terminate all
                                         ------------------
of the rights and obligations of the Servicer as Servicer under this Agreement
and in and to the Receivables and the proceeds thereof (other than its rights
and interest, if any, as holder of the Seller Interest or any Notes). After
receipt by the Servicer of such Termination Notice, and on the date that a
Successor Servicer shall have been appointed by the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 7.2, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement
   -----------
shall pass to and be vested in a Successor Servicer; and the Indenture Trustee
is hereby authorized and empowered (upon the

                                       32

<PAGE>

failure of the Servicer to cooperate) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments
upon the failure of the Servicer to execute or deliver such documents or
instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and such Successor
Servicer in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the
Servicer to conduct servicing hereunder, including the transfer to such
Successor Servicer of all authority of the Servicer to service the Receivables
provided for under this Agreement, including all authority over all Collections
which shall on the date of transfer be held by the Servicer for deposit, or
which have been deposited by the Servicer, in any Collection Account or Series
Account, or which shall thereafter be received with respect to the Receivables,
and in assisting the Successor Servicer and in enforcing all rights to Insurance
Proceeds. The Servicer shall promptly transfer its electronic records relating
to the Receivables to the Successor Servicer in such electronic form as the
Successor Servicer may reasonably request and shall promptly transfer to the
Successor Servicer all other records, correspondence and documents necessary for
the continued servicing of the Receivables in the manner and at such times as
the Successor Servicer shall reasonably request. To the extent that compliance
with this Section 7.1 shall require the Servicer to disclose to the Successor
          -----------
Servicer information of any kind which the Servicer reasonably deems to be
confidential, the Successor Servicer shall be required to enter into such
customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Servicer shall deem
necessary to protect its interest. The Servicer shall, on the date of any
servicing transfer, transfer all of its rights and obligations, if any, in
respect of any Enhancement to the Successor Servicer.

     Section 7.2. Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. (a) On and
                  --------------------------------------------------
after the receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice pursuant to Section
                                                                      -------
7.1, the Servicer shall continue to perform all servicing functions under this
---
Agreement until the date specified in the Termination Notice or otherwise
specified by the Indenture Trustee in writing or, if no such date is specified
in such Termination Notice or otherwise specified by the Indenture Trustee,
until a date mutually agreed upon by the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee. The
Indenture Trustee shall as promptly as possible after the giving of a
Termination Notice appoint (with the consent of the Noteholders holding greater
than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of each Series, and with prior
written notice to the Rating Agencies) a successor servicer (the "Successor
                                                                  ---------
Servicer"), and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a
--------
written assumption in a form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture
Trustee may obtain bids from any potential successor servicer. If the Indenture
Trustee is unable to obtain any bids from any potential successor servicer and
the Servicer delivers an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot in
good faith cure the Servicer Default which gave rise to a transfer of servicing,
then the Owner Trustee shall offer Seller the right to accept retransfer of all
the Receivables and Seller may accept retransfer of all the Receivables,
provided, however, that if the long-term unsecured debt obligations of Seller
--------  -------
are not rated at the time of such purchase at least Baa3 by Moody's and BBB- by
Standard & Poor's, no such retransfer shall occur unless Seller shall deliver an
Opinion of Counsel

                                       33

<PAGE>

reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee that such retransfer would not
constitute a fraudulent conveyance of Seller. The retransfer deposit amount for
such a retransfer shall be equal to the higher of the sum of (i) the outstanding
principal balance of the Notes, plus accrued interest thereon, at the Note Rate,
through the date of retransfer and (ii) the average bid price quoted by two
recognized dealers for a similar security rated in the highest rating category
by Moody's and Standard & Poor's and having a remaining maturity substantially
similar to the remaining maturity of the Notes. In the event that a Successor
Servicer has not been appointed and has not accepted its appointment at the time
when the Servicer ceases to act as Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without
further action shall automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer.
Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee shall, if it is legally unable
so to act, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint any established
financial institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and whose
regular business includes the servicing of installment sales charge, credit
and/or credit card account receivables as the Successor Servicer hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indenture Trustee be liable for any servicing fee.

     (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Servicer shall be the successor in
all respects to the Servicer with respect to servicing functions under this
Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions
hereof, and all references in this Agreement to the Servicer shall be deemed to
refer to the Successor Servicer. Any Successor Servicer, by its acceptance of
its appointment, will automatically agree to be bound by the terms and
provisions of any Enhancement to the extent that such terms apply to the
Servicer. Any sub-servicing agreement shall be assigned to the Successor
Servicer.

     (c) In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation, or may make such arrangements
for the compensation of the Successor Servicer out of Collections, as it and
such Successor Servicer shall agree; provided, however, that no such
                                     --------  -------
compensation shall be in excess of the Monthly Servicing Fees permitted to the
Servicer pursuant to Section 3.2. The Holder of the Seller Interest agrees that
                     -----------
if the Servicer is terminated hereunder, it will agree, at the request of the
Indenture Trustee or any Successor Servicer, to deposit a portion of the
Collections in respect of Finance Charge Receivables that it is entitled to
receive pursuant to the Indenture, to pay its share of the compensation of the
Successor Servicer. The Successor Servicer shall have no liability for any
actions or failure to act on the part of the Servicer.

     (d) All authority and power granted to the Successor Servicer under this
Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of the Issuer
pursuant to the Trust Agreement and shall pass to and be vested in Seller and,
Seller is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of
the Successor Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and
other instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary
or appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The
Successor Servicer

                                       34

<PAGE>

agrees to cooperate with Seller in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Successor Servicer to conduct servicing on
the Receivables. The Successor Servicer shall transfer its electronic records
relating to the Receivables to Seller in such electronic form as Seller may
reasonably request and shall transfer all other records, correspondence and
documents to Seller in the manner and at such times as Seller shall reasonably
request. To the extent that compliance with this Section 7.2 shall require the
                                                 -----------
Successor Servicer to disclose to Seller information of any kind which the
Successor Servicer deems to be confidential, Seller shall be required to enter
into such customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Successor
Servicer shall deem necessary to protect its interests.

     Section 7.3. Notification to Noteholders. Upon the occurrence of any
                  ---------------------------
Servicer Default, the Servicer shall give prompt written notice thereof to a
Trustee Officer of the Indenture Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall give
notice to the Noteholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Note
Register. Upon any termination or appointment of a Successor Servicer pursuant
to this Article VII, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice
        -----------
thereof to Noteholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Note
Register. A copy of any notice given pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be

     (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Servicer, Seller
and the Issuer, without the consent of any of the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions herein
which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein or to add any other
provisions with respect to matters or questions raised under this Agreement
which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; provided,

however, that such action shall not adversely affect in any material respect the

interests of any of the Noteholders. Additionally, this Agreement may be amended
from time to time by the Servicer, the Seller and the Issuer by a written
instrument signed by each of them, without the consent of the Indenture Trustee
or any of the Noteholders; provided that (i) Seller shall have delivered to the
                           --------
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee an Officer's Certificate, dated the date
of any such Amendment, stating that

<PAGE>

Seller reasonably believes that such amendment will not have an Adverse Effect
and (ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to
any such amendment. Additionally, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be amended by the Servicer and the Issuer at the direction of
Seller without the consent of the Indenture Trustee or any of the Noteholders or
Series Enhancers to add, modify or eliminate such provisions as may be necessary
or advisable in order to enable all or a portion of the Issuer (1) to qualify
as, and to permit an election to be made to cause the Issuer to be treated as, a
"financial asset securitization investment trust" as described in the provisions
of Section 860L of the Code, and (2) to avoid the imposition of state or local
income or franchise taxes imposed on the Issuer's property or its income;
provided, however, that (A) Seller delivers to the Indenture Trustee and the
--------  -------
Owner Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that the proposed
amendments meet the requirements set forth in this Section, (B) the Rating
Agency Condition has been satisfied, and (C) such amendment does not affect the
rights, duties or obligations of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
hereunder. The amendments which Seller may make without the consent of
Noteholders or Series Enhancers pursuant to the preceding sentence may include
the addition of a Seller.

Seller and the Issuer, with the consent of the Noteholders holding more than 66
2/3% of the Outstanding principal amount of the Notes of each Series affected
thereby for which Seller has not delivered an Officer's Certificate stating that
there is no Adverse Effect, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or
of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
that no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of or delay the
timing of any distributions (changes in Pay Out Events or Events of Default that
decrease the likelihood of the occurrence thereof shall not be considered delays
in the timing of distributions for purposes of this clause) to be made to
Noteholders or deposits of amounts to be so distributed or the amount available
under any Series Enhancement without the consent of each affected Noteholder,
(ii) change the definition of or the manner of calculating the interest of any
Noteholder without the consent of each affected Noteholder or (iii) reduce the
aforesaid percentage required to consent to any such amendment without the
consent of each Noteholder or (iv) adversely affect the rating of any Series or
Class by any Rating Agency without the consent of the Noteholders of such Series
or Class holding more than 66 2/3% of the Outstanding principal amount of the
Notes of such Series or Class affected thereby.

     (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent (other
than an amendment pursuant to paragraph (a)), the Issuer shall furnish
notification of the substance of such amendment to the Indenture Trustee and
each Noteholder, and the Servicer shall furnish notification of the substance of
such amendment to each Rating Agency and each Series Enhancer.

     (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders under this
Section 9.1 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
-----------
shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of

                                       36

<PAGE>

obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the execution
thereof by Noteholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the
Indenture Trustee may prescribe.

     (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to the contrary, no
                                          -----------
amendment may be made to this Agreement which would adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Series Enhancer without the consent of
such Series Enhancer.

     (f) Any Indenture Supplement executed in accordance with the provisions of
Article X of the Indenture shall not be considered an amendment of this
---------
Agreement for the purposes of this Section 9.1.
                                   -----------

     (g) The Noteholders holding 66 2/3% or more of the Outstanding principal
amount of the Notes of each Series or, with respect to any Series with two (2)
or more Classes, of each Class (or, with respect to any default that does not
relate to all Series, 66 2/3% or more of the principal amount of the Outstanding
Notes of each Series to which such default relates or, with respect to any such
Series with two or more Classes, of each Class) may, on behalf of all
Noteholders, waive any default by Seller or the Servicer in the performance of
their obligations hereunder and its consequences, except the failure to make any
distributions required to be made to Noteholders or to make any required
deposits of any amounts to be so distributed. Upon any such waiver of a past
default, such default shall cease to exist, and any default arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.

     (h) The Owner Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any
such amendment which affects the Owner Trustee's rights, duties or immunities
under this Agreement or otherwise. In connection with the execution of any

31, 200 , which sets forth in detail the (i) nature of each such default, (ii)
       -
the action taken by the Servicer, if any, to remedy each such default and (iii)
the current status of each such default: [If applicable, insert "None."]

The Management of First Consumers National Bank, First Consumers Credit
Corporation and The Bank of New York:

We have performed the procedures enumerated below, which were agreed to by the
management of First Consumers National Bank ("FCNB"), First Consumers Credit
                                              ----
Corporation ("FCCC") and The Bank of New York (the "Trustee"), solely to assist
              ----                                  -------
you in evaluating the Monthly Noteholder's Statements and the Monthly Servicer
Certificates (collectively, the Certificates) issued pursuant to the Transfer
and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 31, 2001 among FCNB, FCCC and First
Consumers Credit Card Master Note Trust (the "Transfer and Servicing Agreement")
                                              --------------------------------
in accordance with the requirements stated therein. This agreed-upon procedures
engagement was performed in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency of these
procedures is solely the responsibility of FCNB, FCCC and the Trustee.
Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the
procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been
requested or for any other purpose.

For purposes of these agreed-upon procedures, differences between reported
amounts and FCNB (the "Servicer") documented amounts of less than or equal to
                       --------
$5,000 or 5% of the average of the amounts being compared were not considered
exceptions to the procedures performed. Our procedures and findings are as
follows:

                                  Exhibit E-1

<PAGE>

1.   We compared and/or recalculated, each of the amounts or entries shown in
     the Monthly Noteholder's Statements and the Monthly Servicer Certificates,
     other than entries showing "zero" amounts or "not applicable", for each of
     the months in the year ended December 31,       based on one or more of the
                                               -----
     following:

          .    Corresponding amounts or entries on the Transfer and Servicing
               Agreement,

          .    Schedules prepared by FCNB,

          .    Data extracted from FCNB's credit accounting system,

          .    Data provided to FCNB from the Trustee,

          .    Recalculations based on schedules prepared by FCNB and data
               extracted from FCNB's credit accounting system, or

          .    In instances where timely data was not available at the time the
               Certificates were prepared, to documented estimates by the
               Servicer.

     g.   We read the "Annual Servicer's Certificate" for the year ended
          December 31,       required by the Transfer and Servicing Agreement
                       -----
          and made inquiries of FCNB's management regarding FCNB's compliance
          with the guidelines of the Transfer and Servicing Agreement. FCNB's
          management represented full compliance with the Transfer and Servicing
          Agreement.

We were not engaged to, and did not, perform an examination, the objective of
which would be the expression of an opinion on the Certificates. Accordingly, we
do not express such an opinion. Had we performed additional procedures, other
matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the specified
users listed above and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone

     The opinions set forth below may be subject to all the qualifications,

delivered on any applicable Closing Date.

     (i) The amendment to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement, attached hereto
as Schedule 1 (the "Amendment" ), has been duly authorized, executed and
   ----------       ---------
delivered by Seller and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of

or other laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors' rights generally.
The enforceability of Seller's obligations is also subject to general principles

                        TRANSFER AND SERVICING AGREEMENT

        (Provisions to be included in Opinion of Counsel to be delivered
            pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(vii) and Section 9.2(d)(ii))
                        -------------------     ------------------

     The opinions set forth below may be subject to all the qualifications,
assumptions, limitations and exceptions taken or made in the Opinions of Counsel
delivered on any applicable Closing Date.

     1. Except for any Receivable that is evidenced by an instrument, the
Receivables constitute accounts under Article 9 of the applicable UCC.

     2. If the Assignment, together with the Agreement, constitutes a valid
assignment of all Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables in Schedule 1 to the Assignment and all rights to security for such
               ----------
Receivables and the proceeds thereof (including without limitation rights to
bank accounts or certificates of deposit pledged as collateral) (the
"Collateral") and all of the Seller's rights, remedies, powers, and privileges
 ----------
with respect to such Collateral, then the Issuer has or will acquire all of
Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the Collateral free and
clear of any Lien or interest of any person at the time of transfer (and anytime
thereafter with respect to any Lien or interest arising through or under the
Seller except as provided in the Agreement), except for Liens for municipal or
other local taxes permitted under Section 2.5(b) of the Agreement.

     3. If the Assignment, together with the Agreement, does not constitute a
valid assignment of all of the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and
under the Collateral, then the Assignment creates a valid security interest in
all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Collateral in favor
of the Issuer.

     4. The Receivables Purchase Agreement constitutes a valid assignment of all
of the RPA Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the Collateral
and all of its rights, remedies, powers, and privileges with respect to such
Collateral. The Seller has or will acquire all the RPA Seller's right, title and
interest in, to and under such Collateral free and clear of any Lien or interest
of any person at the time of transfer (and anytime thereafter with respect to
any Lien or interest arising through or under the RPA Seller, except as provided
in the Agreement), except for Liens for state, municipal or other local taxes.

     5. The security interest described in paragraphs 3 above is perfected and
of first priority.

                                  AND COVENANTS

     In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in
the Transfer and Servicing Agreement, Seller hereby represents, warrants and
covenants to the Trust as follows:

     (1) The Transfer and Servicing Agreement creates either (A) a valid
transfer to the Issuer of all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and
under (i) the Receivables conveyed to the Seller pursuant to the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, (ii) all rights to security for such Receivables (including
without limitation rights to bank accounts or certificates of deposit pledged as
collateral) (the "Obligor Collateral") and (iii) the Collateral Certificate (the
                  ------------------
Obligor Collateral and Collateral Certificate together with the Receivables, the
"Collateral") and the Collateral will be held by the Issuer free and clear of
 ----------
any Lien, except for (w) the interests of the Noteholders and the Enhancement
Providers, (x) Liens permitted pursuant to paragraph 3 below, or (y) the
interests of the Seller as holder of the Seller Interest or (B) a valid and
continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the
Collateral in favor of the Issuer, which security interest is prior to all other
Liens, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from the
Seller (other than Liens permitted pursuant to paragraph 3 below).

     (2) The Receivables constitute "accounts" within the meaning of the
applicable UCC. The Obligor Collateral constitutes security interests on
personal property securing certain of those accounts, and the creation and
perfection of a security interest in such security interests is governed by
Sections 9-203(g) and 9- 308(e), respectively, of the applicable UCC. The
Collateral Certificate constitutes a "certificated security," "instrument" or
"general intangible" within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

     (3) Immediately prior to the conveyance of, or grant of the security
interest in, the Collateral pursuant to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement,
Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the Collateral, and a valid,
perfected security interest in the collateral for the Receivables in any secured
Accounts, in each case, free and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of any
Person; provided that nothing in this paragraph 3 shall prevent or be deemed to
prohibit Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the Collateral any Liens for
any taxes if such taxes shall not at the time be due and payable or if FCNB or
Seller, as applicable, shall currently be contesting the validity thereof in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its books
adequate reserves with respect thereto. Seller has received all consents and
approvals required by the terms of the Collateral to the valid transfer of or
grant of security interest in the Collateral hereunder to the Issuer.

     (4) (a) If perfection is by filing, Seller has caused, or will have caused
within 10 days, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper
filing

                                     1 - 2

<PAGE>

office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect
the security interest in the Collateral granted to the Issuer under the Transfer
and Servicing Agreement. (b) If perfection is by possession, all original
executed copies of each mortgage note, promissory note or security certificate
that constitutes or evidences the Collateral has been delivered to the Issuer.
Each security certificate either (i) is in bearer form, (ii) has been indorsed,
by an effective indorsement, to the Issuer or in blank or (iii) has been
registered in the name of the Issuer.

     (5) Other than the grant of the security interest in the Collateral to the
Issuer pursuant to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement, Seller has not pledged,
assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
Collateral. Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
financing statements against Seller that include a description of collateral
covering the Collateral. (a) If perfection is by filing, Issuer has in its
possession all original copies of the mortgage notes, promissory notes or
security certificates that constitute or evidence the Collateral. The mortgage
notes, promissory notes or security certificates that constitute or evidence the
Collateral do not have any marks or notations indicating that they have been
pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Issuer. All
financing statements to be filed against Seller in favor of Issuer in connection
herewith describing the Collateral will contain a statement to the effect that
"A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in this
financing statement will violate the rights of the Issuer". (b) If perfection is
by possession, none of the mortgage notes, promissory notes or security
certificates that constitute or evidence the Collateral have any marks or
notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed
to any Person other than the Issuer.

     (6) Seller is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against
Seller.

     (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Transfer and Servicing
Agreement, the representations and warranties set forth in this Schedule 2 shall
                                                                ----------
be continuing, and remain in full force and effect, until such time as all Notes
have been finally and fully paid and shall survive the transfer of the Trust
Assets to the Issuer under the Transfer and Servicing Agreement and the
termination of the rights and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to Article
                                                                      -------
VII thereof. The parties to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall not,
---
without satisfying the Rating Agency Condition, waive a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Schedule 2. In order to evidence
                                             ----------
the interests of Seller and the Issuer under the Transfer and Servicing
Agreement, Seller and Servicer shall take such action, or execute and deliver
such instruments (other than filing financing statements) as may be necessary or
advisable (including, without limitation, such actions as are requested by
Indenture Trustee) to maintain and perfect, as a first priority interest,
Seller's or the Issuer's security interest in the Collateral. The Servicer
shall, from time to time and within the time limits established by law, prepare
and present to the Issuer for the Indenture Trustee's authorization and approval
all financing statements, amendments, continuations or initial financing
statements in lieu of a continuation statement, or other filings

                                     1 - 3

<PAGE>

necessary to continue, maintain and perfect as a first-priority interest. The
Indenture Trustee's approval of such filings shall authorize the Servicer to
file such financing statements under the applicable UCC without the signature of
Seller or Issuer where allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything else
in the Transfer and Servicing Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer shall not
have any authority to file a termination, partial termination, release, partial
release, or any amendment that deletes the name of a debtor or excludes
collateral of any such financing statements, without the prior written consent
of the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer may require, prior to authorizing or filing
any such termination, partial termination, release, partial release or
amendment, that Servicer provide an Opinion of Counsel that such filings are
authorized under the Transfer and Servicing Agreement.
