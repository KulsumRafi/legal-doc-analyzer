      THIS RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), entered into as
of the 1st day of February 2003, by and between LEHMAN BROTHERS BANK, a federal
savings bank (the "Bank"), and WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK, FA, a savings association
organized under the laws of the United States, successor in interest to NORTH
AMERICAN MORTGAGE COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (together, the "Servicer"),
recites and provides as follows:

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, AIG Centre Capital Group Inc., formerly Centre Capital Group,
Inc. ("CCGI"), acquired certain first lien, fixed and adjustable rate,
conventional mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis from the Servicer,
which mortgage loans were either originated or acquired by the Servicer.

      WHEREAS, such mortgage loans are currently being serviced by the Servicer
for CCGI pursuant to a Master Servicing Agreement (the "Master Servicing
Agreement"), dated as of April 18, 2000 and annexed as Exhibit B hereto, by and
between CCGI, as owner, and the Servicer, as servicer.

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the Master Mortgage Loan Purchase and Warranties
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2002 (the "Master Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement"), and annexed as Exhibit C hereto, the Bank has purchased or received
from CCGI all of CCGI's right, title and interest in and to certain of the
mortgage loans currently serviced under the Master Servicing Agreement
(hereinafter, the "Mortgage Loans") and assumed for the benefit of the Servicer
the obligations of CCGI as owner under such Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank has conveyed certain of the Mortgage Loans, as
identified on Exhibit D hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans"), to Structured
Asset Securities Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO"),
which in turn has conveyed the Serviced Mortgage Loans to Citibank, N.A. (the
"Trustee"), pursuant to a trust agreement dated as of February 1, 2003 (the
"Trust Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora Loan Services Inc., as master
servicer ("Aurora," and, together with any successor Master Servicer appointed
pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer") and
SASCO.

      WHEREAS, the Bank desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the Master
Servicing Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced Mortgage Loans,
except to the extent otherwise provided herein and that this Agreement shall
constitute a Reconstitution Agreement (as such term is defined in the Master
Servicing Agreement) which shall govern the Serviced Mortgage Loans for so long
as such Serviced Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated,

<PAGE>

      among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced Mortgage
Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the conditions
specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer intend that each of the Master Servicer
and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Bank and the Servicer hereby agree as
follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement,
including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement
incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are defined
in the Master Servicing Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Trust Agreement; provided, however, Due Period, Principal
Prepayment Period and Event of Default shall have the meaning ascribed to each
such term in the Master Servicing Agreement.

      2. Servicing. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the Serviced Mortgage
Loans, to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that
are to be performed and observed under the provisions of the Master Servicing
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and that
the provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement, as so modified, are and shall
be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full.

      3. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including any
successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the Master
Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the Servicer
services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the SASCO
2003-7H Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
shall have the same rights as the Bank, as owner, under the Master Servicing
Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the Master Servicing
Agreement and the term "Owner" as used in the Master Servicing Agreement in
connection with any rights of the Owner shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the
context requires, the Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the
Trust Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement upon the failure of the Servicer to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of
Default as provided in Section 9.01 of the Master Servicing Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master
Servicer assume any of the obligations of the Bank under the Master Servicing
Agreement; and in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

      4. Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer shall be
obligated

<PAGE>

or required to make any representations and warranties regarding the
characteristics of the Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the
Certificates issued pursuant thereto. The Servicer hereby restates as of the
Closing Date the representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 of the
Master Servicing Agreement.

      warranties of the Owner and (ii) Whole-Loan Transfers, Pass-Through
      Transfers, Acknowledgement Agreements, Closing Dates, Cut-off Dates and
      First Remittance Dates shall be disregarded. Unless otherwise specified
      herein, for purposes of this Agreement, the exhibits to the Master
      Servicing Agreement and all references to such exhibits shall also be
      disregarded.

2.    The definition of "Custodial Agreement" in Article I is hereby amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:

            "Custodial Agreement" means the Trust Agreement.

3.    The definition of "Custodian" in Article I is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            "Custodian" means Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A.

4.    The definition of "Due Date" in Article I is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            "Due Date": With respect to any Mortgage Loan and any Remittance
            Date, the day of the month on which the Mortgage Payment is due and
            (i) if such day is the first day of the calendar month, such day

            day of the calendar month, such day shall be included in the Due
            Period in the month prior to the related Remittance Date. Based on

            example, a payment due on November 20 and a payment due on December
            1 each would be remitted on the Remittance Date in the month of
            December.

            credit of the United States of America ("Direct Obligations");

            acting in its respective commercial capacity) incorporated or

            subsidiary of a holding company, the commercial paper or other
            short-term debt or deposit obligations of such holding company or

            Rating Agency in its highest short-term rating category;

                  (iv) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount issued

            Agency; provided, however, that securities issued by any particular

            investment therein will cause the then outstanding principal amount
            of securities issued by such corporation and held as part of the
            Trust Fund to exceed 20% of the sum of the aggregate principal
            balance of the Mortgage Loans; provided, further, that such
            securities will not be Eligible Investments if they are published as

            interests in future interest or principal payments on obligations of
            the United States of America or its agencies or instrumentalities
            (which obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the

            investment, (A) rated in the highest rating category by each Rating
            Agency or (B) that would not adversely affect the then current
            rating by each Rating Agency of any of the Certificates. Such
            investments in this subsection (viii) may include money market
            mutual funds or common trust funds, including any fund for which the

            investment advisor, administrator, shareholder servicing agent,
            and/or custodian or subcustodian, notwithstanding that (x) the
            Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof charges and
            collects fees and expenses from such funds for services rendered,
            (y) the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof charges
            and collects fees and expenses for services rendered pursuant to
            this Agreement, and (z) services performed for such funds and
            pursuant to this Agreement may converge at any time, provided,
            however, that no such instrument shall be an Eligible Investment if
            such instrument evidences either (i) a right to receive only
            interest payments with respect to the obligations underlying such
            instrument, or (ii) both principal and interest payments derived
            from obligations underlying such instrument and the principal and
            interest payments with respect to such instrument provide a yield to
            maturity of greater than 120% of the yield to maturity at par of
            such underlying obligations.

            Loan Remittance Rate) that was due on the Mortgage Loan on the
            related Due Date, and that (i) was delinquent at the close of
            business on the related Determination Date and (ii) was not the
            subject of a previous Monthly Advance, but only to the extent that
            such amount is expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer,
            to be recoverable from collections or other recoveries in respect of
            such Mortgage Loan.

      entirety to read as follows:

            standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract is
            such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of funds

            Servicer shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
            entitled to the return of all funds previously invested thereunder,
            together with accrued interest thereon at the interest rate provided

            interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account, as the case

            interest portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from
            Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds,


                                      A-5

            Insurance Proceeds, REO Disposition Proceeds) of such Monthly
            Payment collected by the Servicer or as otherwise provided under
            this Agreement.

15.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.02 (Books and Records) of
      the Master Servicing Agreement shall be modified to indicate that the
      Servicer shall prepare and execute at the direction of the Bank any note
      endorsements in connection with transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the
      Trust Fund as the Owner of the Mortgage Loans and that the Bank shall pay
      for any fees associated with the preparation and execution of such note
      endorsements to the Trust Fund.

16.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.03 (Commencement of
      Servicing Responsibilities) shall be inapplicable to this Agreement.

17.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 2.04 (Custodial Agreement)
      shall be inapplicable to this Agreement, as superseded by the provisions

18.   Section 3.01 (Servicer to Service) is hereby amended and restated in its
      entirety to read as follows:

            Section 3.01 Servicer to Service.

                  From the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loans to
            the related Closing Date, the Servicer shall have serviced the
            related Mortgage Loans in accordance with Accepted Servicing
            Practices. From and after the related Closing Date, the Servicer, as
            an independent contractor, shall service and administer the Mortgage
            Loans pursuant to this Agreement and shall have full power and
            authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with
            such servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem
            necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement
            and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may
            waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to
            the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any
            manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Servicer's
            reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
            postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Owner,
            provided, however, that (unless the Mortgagor is in default with
            respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of
            the Servicer, imminent and the Servicer has obtained the prior
            written consent of the Owner) the Servicer shall not permit any
            modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the
            Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of principal or
            interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance
            (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final
            maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. With respect to a
            Reconstitution Agreement, in the event of any such modification
            which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments on any
            Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day immediately
            preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
            principal or interest payment


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

            has been deferred, deposit in the Custodial Account from its own
            funds, in accordance with Section 3.04, the difference between (a)
            such month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan
            Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage
            Loan and (b) the amount paid by the Mortgagor. Without limiting the
            generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue, and is
            hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of
            itself and the Owner, all instruments of satisfaction or
            cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other
            comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with
            respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably required by the
            Servicer, the Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
            attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the
            Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under
            this Agreement.

                  Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
            consolidation or extension of any Mortgage loan, the Servicer shall
            forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing
            such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
            Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any modification,
            waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would
            cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to fail to qualify
            as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under Section
            860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
            Servicer shall employ procedures (including collection procedures)
            and exercise the same care that it customarily employs and exercises
            in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account,
            giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices where such
            practices do not conflict with the requirements of this Agreement,
            and the Owner's reliance on the Servicer.

                  Unless written consultation and approval by the Owner, is
            required pursuant to this Section 3.01, the Servicer may, without
            such consultation and approval, take actions relative to the
            servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans that are
            consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices.

19.   The parties hereto acknowledge that references to the "Owner" in the
      second and third paragraphs of Section 3.02 shall refer to the Master
      Servicer, except that the expense of any environmental inspection or
      review at the request of the Master Servicer shall be an expense of the
      Trust Fund.

20.   The parties hereto acknowledge that the (i) reference to "[Servicer]" in
      the fourth line of the first paragraph of Section 3.04 shall be to
      "Washington Mutual Bank, FA," (ii) reference to"[Owner]" in the fourth
      line of the first paragraph of Section 3.04 shall be to the "SASCO 2003-7H
      Trust Fund", (iii) the third sentence of the first paragraph of Section
      3.04 shall be deleted in its entirety and (iv) reference to "Cut-off Date"
      in the second paragraph of Section 3.04 shall mean "February 1, 2003."

21.   Section 3.06 (Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account) is hereby
      amended by (i) changing the words "Washington Mutual Bank, FA in trust for
      Centre Capital Group, Inc., owner of Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage
      Loans, and various Mortgagors" appearing in the fourth, fifth and sixth
      lines of the first paragraph thereof to "Washington Mutual Bank, FA in
      trust for the SASCO 2003-7H Trust Fund," and (ii) deleting the following
      words from the end of the second sentence of the first paragraph of
      Section 3.06: "in a manner that shall provide maximum available insurance
      hereunder."

22.   Section 3.10 is hereby amended by deleting in its entirety the proviso to
      the first sentence of the third paragraph of Section 3.10.

23.   Section 3.18 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is hereby
      amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                  Section 3.18. Title, Management and Disposition of REO
                                Property.

                  In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
            in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or
            certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of the Trust Fund or
            Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the Trust Fund,
            or in the event the Trust Fund or Master Servicer as agent for the
            Trust Fund is not authorized or permitted to hold title to real
            property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would be
            adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such
            state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
            taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent
            with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Trust Fund or Master
            Servicer as agent for the Trust Fund from any attorney duly licensed
            to practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. The
            Person or Persons holding such title other than the Trust Fund or
            Master Servicer as agent for the Trust Fund shall acknowledge in
            writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Trust Fund.

                  The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
            REO Property for the Trust Fund solely for the purpose of its prompt
            disposition and sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an
            agent selected by the Servicer, shall manage, conserve, protect and
            operate the REO Property in the same manner that it manages,
            conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for its
            own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the
            same locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall
            attempt to sell the same (and may temporarily rent the same for a
            period not greater than three years, except as otherwise provided
            below) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer deems to be in
            the best interest of the Trust Fund.

                  In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property in
            connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan,
            the Servicer shall dispose of such REO Property not later than the
            end of the third taxable year after the year of its acquisition by
            the Trust Fund unless the Servicer has applied for and


                                      A-8
<PAGE>

            received a grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service to
            the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant
            proposed legislation and under applicable state law, the applicable
            Trust REMIC may hold REO Property for a longer period without
            adversely affecting the REMIC status of such REMIC or causing the
            imposition of a federal or state tax upon such REMIC. If the
            Servicer has received such an extension, then the Servicer shall
            continue to attempt to sell the REO Property for its fair market
            value for such period longer than three years as such extension
            permits (the "Extended Period"). If the Servicer has not received
            such an extension and the Servicer is unable to sell the REO
            Property within the period ending 3 months before the end of such
            third taxable year after its acquisition by the Trust Fund or if the
            Servicer has received such an extension, and the Servicer is unable
            to sell the REO Property within the period ending three months
            before the close of the Extended Period, the Servicer shall, before
            the end of the three year period or the Extended Period, as
            applicable, (i) purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the
            REO Property's fair market value or (ii) auction the REO Property to
            the highest bidder (which may be the Servicer) in an auction
            reasonably designed to produce a fair price prior to the expiration
            of the three-year period or the Extended Period, as the case may be.
            The Trustee shall sign any document or take any other action
            reasonably requested by the Servicer which would enable the
            Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to request such grant of
            extension.

                  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO
            Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to
            continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the
            Trust Fund in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i)
            cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property"
            within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii)
            subject any Trust REMIC to the imposition of any federal income
            taxes on the income earned from such REO Property, including any
            taxes imposed by reason of Sections 860F or 860G(c) of the Code,
            unless the Servicer has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the
            Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

                  If a period longer than three years is permitted under the
            foregoing and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the
            Servicer shall report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the
            progress being made in selling such REO Property and (ii) if, with
            the written consent of the Master Servicer, a purchase money
            mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money
            mortgage shall name the Trust Fund as mortgagee.

                  The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
            hazard insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at
            least equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the maximum insurable value
            of the improvements which are a part of such property, or (b) unpaid
            principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan at the time it
            becomes an REO Property, liability insurance and, to the extent
            required and available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
            1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount required above.


                                      A-9
<PAGE>

                  The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
            Servicer at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the
            Servicer deems to be in the best interests of the Trust Fund. The
            proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall be promptly deposited in
            the Custodial Account. As soon as practical thereafter the expenses
            of such sale shall be paid and the Servicer shall reimburse itself
            for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid Servicing
            Fees, and on the Remittance Date immediately following the date on
            which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such
            sale remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the
            Master Servicer.

                  The Servicer shall advance funds necessary for the proper
            operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property, including
            the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to Section
            3.12 and the fees of any managing agent of the Servicer, or the
            Servicer itself, which advances shall be deemed "Servicing Advances"
            for the purposes hereunder. The REO management fee shall be an
            amount that is reasonable and customary in the area where the
            Mortgaged Property is located. The Servicer shall make monthly
            distributions on each Remittance Date to the Master Servicer of the
            net cash flow from the REO Property (which shall equal the revenues
            from such REO Property net of the expenses described in this Section
            3.18 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to be
            maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to
            time, the Master Servicer as agent for the Trust Fund may at its
            election terminate this Agreement with respect to one or more REO
            Properties as provided by Section 9.02.

                  Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any
            REO Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of such
            offer in writing which notification shall set forth all material
            terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer
            shall be deemed to have approved the sale of any REO Property unless
            the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing, within five
            (5) days after its receipt of the related Notice of Sale, that it
            disapproves of the related sale, in which case the Servicer shall
            not proceed with such sale.

24.   Section 4.02 (Statements to Owner) is hereby amended by (i) renaming the
      section "Statements to Master Servicer," (ii) adding the words "or, if
      such calendar day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding
      Business Day" after the words "tenth calendar day of each month," (iii)
      changing the words "preceding Determination Date" to the words "last
      calendar day of the preceding month," (iv) substituting "Master Servicer"
      for "Owner" throughout and (v) adding the following paragraph (d) to such
      Section to read as follows:

                  (d) In addition to the Monthly Remittance Advice, as a
            separate report to be furnished upon request by the Master Servicer,
            the Servicer shall provide

            information on a current and cumulative basis regarding the amount

            in the Custodial Account on such Remittance Date shall be less than
            payments to the Trust Fund required to be made on such Remittance
            Date.

26.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 4.04 (Due Dates Other Than the

            year in the case of the first such certificate) and that, on the
            basis of such examination conducted substantially in compliance with
            the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, such
            firm is of the opinion that Servicer's overall servicing operations
            have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single
            Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers except for such exceptions

            Program for Mortgage Bankers requires it to report, in which case
            such exceptions shall be set forth in such statement.

            on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under
            this Agreement for such year, or, if there has been a default in the
            fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each such default
            known to such officer and the nature and status thereof including
            the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default.

                  (a) By February 28th of each year (or if not a Business Day,
            the immediately preceding Business Day), or in connection with any
            additional such certifications directly filed by the Depositor upon
            thirty (30) days written request, an officer of the Servicer shall
            execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate in the form of Exhibit
            E attached hereto, signed by the senior officer in charge of
            servicing of the Servicer or any officer to whom that officer
            reports, to the Master Servicer and the Depositor for the benefit of
            such Master Servicer and such Depositor and their respective
            officers, directors and affiliates, certifying as to the following
            matters:

                        (1) I have reviewed the information required to be
                  delivered to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Agreement
                  (the "Servicing Information").

                        (2) Based on my knowledge, the information relating to
                  the Mortgage Loans submitted by the Servicer in its monthly
                  reporting packages delivered to the Master Servicer which is

                  Form 10-K with respect to the Transaction, taken as a whole,
                  does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
                  omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
                  made, in light of the circumstances under which such
                  statements were made, not misleading as of the date of this
                  certification;

                        (3) Based on my knowledge, the Servicing Information
                  required to be provided to the Master Servicer by the Servicer
                  under this Agreement has been provided to the Master Servicer;

                        (4) I am responsible for reviewing the activities
                  performed by the Servicer under this Agreement and based upon
                  the review required


                                      A-12
<PAGE>

                  hereunder, and except as disclosed in the Annual Statement of
                  Compliance, the Annual Independent Certified Public
                  Accountant's Servicing Report and all servicing reports,
                  officer's certificates and other information relating to the
                  servicing of the Mortgage Loans submitted to the Master
                  Servicer, the Servicer has, as of this certification fulfilled
                  its obligations under this Agreement; and

                        (5) I have disclosed to the Master Servicer and the
                  Depositor all significant deficiencies relating to the
                  Servicer's compliance with the minimum servicing standards in
                  accordance with a review conducted in compliance with the
                  Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers or
                  similar standard as set forth in this Agreement.

                  (b) The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master
            Servicer and the Depositor and their respective officers, directors,
            agents and affiliates from and against any losses, damages,
            penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related
            costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out of or
            based upon a breach by the Servicer or any of its officers,
            directors, agents or affiliates of its obligations under this
            Section 5.08 any material misstatement or omission in the Officer's
            Certificate required under this Section or the negligence, bad faith
            or willful misconduct of the Servicer in connection therewith. If
            the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or
            insufficient to hold harmless the Master Servicer and the Depositor,
            then the Servicer agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid
            or payable by the Master Servicer and the Depositor as a result of
            the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Master Servicer
            and the Depositor in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
            the relative fault of the Master Servicer and the Depositor on the
            one hand and the Servicer on the other in connection with a breach
            of the Servicer's obligations under this Section 5.08, any material
            misstatement or omission in the Officer's Certificate required under
            this Section or the Servicer's negligence, bad faith or willful
            misconduct in connection therewith.

31.   The first and second lines of Section 6.01(a) are hereby restated to read
      as follows:

                  The Servicer is a federally chartered savings association,
            duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
            applicable law and has all licenses

32.   The second, third and fourth paragraphs of Section 6.02 (Remedies for
      Breach of Representations and Warranties of the Servicer) are hereby
      restated to read as follows:

                  Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice
            to the Servicer of any Breach of a representation or warranty set
            forth in Section 6.01 which materially and adversely affects the
            ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and obligations under
            this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects the
            value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority
            of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer
            shall use its Best Efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all
            material respects and, if such Breach


                                      A-13
<PAGE>

            cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Trustee's option, assign
            the Servicer's rights and obligations under this Agreement (or
            respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor Servicer
            selected by the Trustee with the prior consent and approval of the
            Master Servicer. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with
            Section 10.01.

                  In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify (from its own funds)
            the Trustee, the Trust Fund and the Master Servicer and hold each of
            them harmless against any costs resulting from any claim, demand,
            defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a
            Breach of the Servicer's representations and warranties contained in
            this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the remedies set
            forth in this Section 6.02 constitute the sole remedies of the
            Master Servicer, the Trust Fund and the Trustee respecting a breach
            of the foregoing representations and warranties.

                  Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or
            arising out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made
            in Section 6.01 shall accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by
            the Servicer or notice thereof by the Trustee or Master Servicer to
            the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such breach
            within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the
            Servicer by the Trustee or the Master Servicer for compliance with
            this Agreement.

33.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 6.03 (Representations and
      Warranties of the Owner), Section 6.04 (Remedies for Breach of
      Representations and Warranties of Owner) Section 7.01 (Removal of Mortgage
      Loans from Inclusion Under the Agreement Upon a Pass-Through Transfer or a
      Whole Loan Transfer on One or More Reconstituted Dates) and Section 7.02
      (Owner's Repurchase and Indemnification Obligations) are inapplicable to
      this Agreement.

34.   Section 7.03 (Indemnification; Third Party Claims) is hereby amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Trust Fund, the Trustee and
            the Master Servicer and hold each of them harmless against any and
            all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
            reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments,
            and any other costs, fees and expenses that any of such parties may
            sustain in any way related to the failure of the Servicer to perform
            its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with
            the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer immediately shall notify
            the Bank, the Master Servicer and the Trustee or any other relevant
            party if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this
            Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the prior written
            consent of the indemnified party) the defense of any such claim and
            pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees,
            and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which
            may be entered against it or any of such parties in respect of such
            claim. The Servicer shall follow any written instructions received
            from the Trustee in connection with such claim. The Trustee from the
            assets of the Trust Fund promptly shall reimburse the Servicer


                                      A-14
<PAGE>

            for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding sentence
            except when the claim is in any way related to the Servicer's
            indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the
            Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  The Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold it
            harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
            fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
            costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the
            Servicer may sustain in any way related to the failure of the
            Trustee or the Master Servicer to perform its duties in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  In the event a dispute arises between an indemnified party and
            the indemnifying party with respect to any of the rights and
            obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement and such
            dispute is adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or
            any other judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify
            and reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other
            costs and expenses related to the adjudication of said dispute.

35.   Section 8.02 is hereby amended (i) by replacing the word "Owner" with the
      words "Master Servicer, Trust Fund or Trustee", (ii) by changing the word
      "Owner" to "Trustee" where it appears in the proviso to the third sentence
      thereof and (iii) by changing the word "Owner" to "Trust Fund" in the
      fourth sentence of such Section.

36.   The first paragraph of Section 8.03 (Limitation on Resignation and
      Assignment by Servicer) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
      follows:

                  Except as permitted in Section 8.01, the Servicer shall
            neither assign this Agreement or the servicing hereunder or delegate
            its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof (to other than
            a third party in the case of outsourcing routine tasks such as
            taxes, insurance and property inspection, in which case the Servicer
            shall fully liable for such tasks as if the Servicer performed them
            itself) or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
            its property or assets without the prior written consent of the
            Trustee and the Master Servicer, which consent shall be granted or
            withheld in the reasonable discretion of such parties, provided,
            however, that the Servicer may assign its rights and obligations
            hereunder without prior written consent of the Trustee and the
            Master Servicer to any entity that is directly owned or controlled
            by the Servicer, and the Servicer guarantees the performance of such
            entity hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer,
            the Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with
            a written statement guaranteeing the successor entity's performance
            of the Servicer's obligations under the Agreement.

      References to "Owner" in the second and third paragraph of Section 8.03
shall refer to the "Master Servicer acting at the direction, or with the prior
consent of, the Trustee".

37.   Section 9.01 is hereby amended by changing the references to "Owner" in
      the third and


                                      A-15
<PAGE>

      fourth paragraph of such section to "Master Servicer."

38.   Section 9.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended in its entirety
      to read as follows:

            Section 9.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
            distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the
            last Mortgage Loan to the Owner (or advances by the Servicer for the
            same), and (b) the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon
            foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all
            funds due hereunder or (ii) mutual consent of the Servicer, the Bank
            and the Master Servicer in writing. Any such notice of termination
            shall be in writing and delivered to the Servicer by registered mail
            to the address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The
            Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Servicer shall comply with the
            termination procedures set forth in Sections 10.01 and 10.03 hereof
            and the procedures set forth below.

                  In connection with any such termination referred to in clause
            (ii) above, the Bank will be responsible for reimbursing the
            Servicer for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances
            within 15 Business Days following the date of termination and other
            reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with any
            transfer of servicing.

                  Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event
            that a Mortgage Loan becomes an REO Property, the Bank may at its
            election terminate this Agreement with respect to such REO Property
            upon 15 days' written notice to the Servicer. In the event of such
            election, the Bank shall reimburse the Servicer for all unreimbursed
            out-of-pocket Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances on the date of
            termination and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs
            associated with any transfer of servicing, including, but not
            limited to, costs associated with the transfer of the related files
            to the Owner's designee.

39.   Section 10.01 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

                  Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
            responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
            Sections 6.02, 8.03, 9.01 or 9.02, the Master Servicer shall, in
            accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed to
            and assume all of the Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties
            and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor
            servicer meeting the eligibility requirements of this Agreement set
            forth in Sections 8.01(i) and (ii) and which shall succeed to all
            rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
            liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement upon the
            termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
            liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer that
            is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust
            Fund shall be subject to the approval of the Master Servicer, the


                                      A-16
<PAGE>

            Bank, the Trustee and each Rating Agency (as such term is defined in
            the Trust Agreement). Unless the successor servicer is at that time
            a Servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating
            Agency must deliver to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such
            transfer of servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal
            or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
            In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
            Servicer or the Depositor, as applicable, may make such arrangements
            for the compensation of such successor out of payments on the
            Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided,
            however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
            permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. In the event that the
            Servicer's duties, responsibilities and liabilities under this
            Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the aforementioned
            sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
            responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
            knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof with
            the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to
            exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever
            that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of
            its successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
            to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a
            successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 10.01 and
            shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the representations and
            warranties made pursuant to Section 6.01 and the remedies available
            to the Trustee under Sections 6.02 and 7.03, it being understood and
            agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02 and 7.03
            shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
            resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of
            this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
            than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer
            shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and
            all documents and other instruments, place in such successor's
            possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other
            acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
            such notice of termination. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
            Trustee and the Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor
            in effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and
            rights hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to
            the successor Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer
            to such successor for administration by it of all cash amounts which
            shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial
            Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
            the Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
            acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the Master
            Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
            successor shall make the representations and warranties set forth in
            Section 6.01 and (ii) an assumption of the due and punctual
            performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
            performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement,
            whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
            rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally named
            as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of


                                      A-17
<PAGE>

            the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections
            9.01 and 9.02 shall not affect any claims that the Master Servicer
            or the Trustee may have against the Servicer arising out of the
            Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to any such termination
            or resignation.

                  The Servicer shall deliver (i) within three (3) Business Days
            to the successor Servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and
            Escrow Account and (ii) within 30 Business Days all Mortgage Loan
            Documents and related documents and statements held by it hereunder
            and the Servicer shall account for all funds and shall execute and
            deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably
            be required to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all
            such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Servicer.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
            Servicer shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
            appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth
            herein.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
            costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of
            servicing hereunder as a result of a termination of the Servicer for
            cause pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Agreement, including, without
            limitation, the costs and expenses of the Master Servicer or any
            other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or of the Master
            Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder,
            or of transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data
            to the successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed
            or resigning Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

40.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 10.02 (Closing), Section 10.03
      (Closing Documents), Section 10.07 (Notices) and Section 10.16 (Exhibits)
      are inapplicable to this Agreement.

41.   A new Section 10.19 is hereby added to the Master Servicing Agreement to
      read as follows:

            Intended Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding any provision
            herein to the contrary, the parties to this Agreement agree that it
            is appropriate, in furtherance of the intent of such parties as set
            forth herein, that the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the
            benefit of the provisions of this Agreement as intended third party
            beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
            The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Master Servicer
            and the Trustee as if they were parties to this Agreement; provided,
            however, that the Servicer's reporting obligations will run directly
            and solely to the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer and the
            Trustee shall have the same rights and remedies to enforce the
            provisions of this Agreement as if they were parties to this
            Agreement. The Servicer shall only take direction from the Master
            Servicer (if direction by the Master Servicer is required under this
            Agreement) unless


                                      A-18

            otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            all rights and obligations of the Master Servicer and the Trustee
            hereunder (other than the right to indemnification) shall terminate
            upon termination of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund
            pursuant to the Trust Agreement.
