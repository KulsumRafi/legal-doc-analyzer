        manner which the Committee in its discretion deems consistent with sec.
        424(a) of the Code) the number, kind or class (or any combination
        thereof) of shares of Stock underlying any Restricted Stock grants
        previously made under this Plan and any related grant conditions and
        forfeiture conditions, and the number, kind or class (or any combination
        thereof) of shares subject to Option grants previously made under this
        Plan and the related Option Price and, further, shall have the right to
        make (in any manner which the Committee in its discretion deems
        consistent with sec. 424(a) of the Code) Restricted Stock and Option
        grants to effect the assumption of, or the substitution for, restricted
        stock or option grants previously made by any other corporation to the
        extent that such corporate transaction calls for such substitution or
        assumption of such restricted stock or option grants."
