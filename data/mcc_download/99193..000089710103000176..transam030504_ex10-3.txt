         Now this Guaranty witnesses and it is hereby declared as follows:

1.       The Guarantor, a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of The
         Netherlands, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to the
         Administrative Agent, for the benefit of itself and the banks, the
         prompt and punctual payment (and not merely the collection) of the
         Guaranteed Indebtedness, when and as the sane shall become due and
         payable. The term "Guaranteed Indebtedness", as used herein, means all
         obligations, indebtedness, and liabilities of Borrower to: (i) the
         Administrative Agent and/or any Bank arising under the Long Term
         Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes (as defined in the Long Term
         Revolving Credit Agreement) and (ii) the Administrative Agent and/or
         any Bank arising under the Short Term Revolving Credit Agreement and
         the Notes (as defined In the Short Term Revolving Credit Agreement),
         whether any of such obligations, indebtedness, and liabilities now
         existing or hereafter arising, whether fixed, contingent, liquidated,
         or unliquidated. The term "Guaranteed Indebtedness": (i) includes,
         without limitation, all post-petition interest, fees, costs, and
         expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) whether or not
         allowed under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or


                                       1
<PAGE>


         other similar law and (ii) excludes the Excluded Amounts, as defined in
         paragraph 3 below.

2.       The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
         unconditional and irrevocable for the duration of this Guaranty, as
         hereinafter set forth, irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
         enforceability of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, (ii) any change of the
         time, manner or place of payment, or any other term, of the Guaranteed
         Indebtedness, (iii) any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction
         affecting any term of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any Bank's rights
         with respect thereto, and (iv) any other circumstance which might
         otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
         Borrower or the Guarantor.

3.       This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the
         indefeasible payment of all principal, premium and interest and all
         other monies payable in respect of Guaranteed Indebtedness; provided
         that (a) if the Guarantor provides the Administrative Agent written
         notice at the address below in the manner described in Section 10.1 of
         the Short Term Revolving Credit Agreement that the Borrower is no
         longer an affiliated company of Guarantor, then on the date that is
         five (5) Business Days after the date the Administrative Agent receives
         such notice (the "Expiration Date"), the Guarantor's obligations
         hereunder shall terminate and be of no force or effect with respect to
         any amounts owed by the Borrower in respect of principal advanced after
         the Expiration Date and (b) this Guaranty shall not extend to any
         amount owed by the Borrower in respect of any principal advanced under
         a Credit Agreement if such principal is advanced after the "Termination
         Date" defined and determined in accordance with such Credit Agreement
         as the same may be extend thereunder (any such amounts which are not
         guaranteed hereunder pursuant to the forgoing clauses (a) and (b) are
         herein the "Excluded Amounts"). Any termination of this Guaranty under
         the forgoing clause (a) and the limitation on the amounts guaranteed
         hereby set forth in the forgoing clause (b) shall not affect the rights
         of the Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to all other
         Guaranteed Indebtedness. The notice of termination delivered under this
         paragraph 3 shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent at Bank of
         America, N.A., 901 Main Street, 66th Floor, Dallas, TX 75202,
         Attention: Shelly Harper, Phone: (214) 209-0567 and Fax: (214) 209-0604
         and shall not be deemed to be received on a day unless such notice is
         received by 6:00 A.M., Chicago, Illinois time on a Business Day and if
         such notice is received after such time, it shall be deemed to be
         received on the next Business Day.

4.       This Guaranty is unsecured and unsubordinated and ranks pari passu with
         all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantor other
         than obligations that by mandatory operation of law would be given
         priority in a dissolution of the Guarantor.

5.       The Guarantor hereby waives (i) demand, notice and presentment,
         promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and all other notice,
         marshalling of assets and set-off, together with any defense by reason
         of extension of time for payment or other indulgence granted by the
         Administrative Agent or any Bank, or any other defense or matter
         whatsoever which would otherwise release the Guarantor, and (ii) any
         requirement that Administrative Agent or any Bank exhaust any right or
         take any action against the Borrower or any collateral security before
         proceeding against the Guarantor. The Guarantor will not exercise any
         rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation or by any indemnity,
         reimbursement or other agreement until all of the Guaranteed
         Indebtedness and all of the obligations under this Guaranty shall have
         been paid in full. The Guarantor agrees that, if at any time all or any
         part of any payment under this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or
         returned by Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever
         (including, without


                                       2
<PAGE>


         limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
         Borrower or the Guarantor), then such amount shall, for purposes of
         this Guaranty, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded
         or returned, be deemed to have continued to be outstanding,
         notwithstanding such payment hereunder to the Administrative Agent or
         any Bank, as the case may be, and this Guaranty shall continue to be
         effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such amount, all
         as though such application had not been made.

6.       In the event of default by Borrower in payment of the Guaranteed
         Indebtedness, or any part thereof, when such Guaranteed Indebtedness
         becomes due, whether by its terms, by acceleration, or otherwise,
         Guarantor shall promptly, on demand, pay the amount due thereon to the
         Administrative Agent. In the event that amounts received by the
         Administrative Agent on account of the Guarantor's obligations
         hereunder are not sufficient to pay in full in cash all of the
         Guaranteed Indebtedness, the amounts received by the Administrative
         Agent shall first be applied as payment of the accrued and unpaid fees
         of the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreements and then to all
         other unpaid or unreimbursed Guaranteed Indebtedness (including
         reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) owing to the Administrative
         Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent and as the agent under
         each Credit Agreement only. Any amount remaining after the applications
         described in the preceding sentence shall be distributed to the Banks
         on a pro rata basis, calculated based on the principal amount of the
         Guaranteed Indebtedness owing to each in relation to the amount of all
         of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. If at any time payment, in whole or in
         part, of any amount received and distributed hereunder is rescinded or
         must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent as a
         preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any bankruptcy,
         insolvency or similar law, then each Bank receiving any portion of such
         amounts, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, agrees to return
         the portion of such amounts it has received to the Administrative
         Agent, on demand. The Administrative Agent is acting as agent hereunder
         under the terms of the agency provisions of each of the Credit
         Agreements and shall be entitled to the benefits and protections
         provided for under such provisions in connection with its role as the
         Administrative Agent hereunder.

7.       Any payments to the Administrative Agent from time to time with respect
         to this Guaranty shall be in United States dollars and shall be payable
         free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on
         account of, any and all present or future taxes, duties, assessments,
         levies and other governmental charges of any nature whatsoever now or
         hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed in the
         Netherlands or in any other jurisdiction from which such payments are
         made or any territory or political subdivision thereof, unless such
         deduction or withholding is required by law ("Foreign Taxes"). If by
         operation of law or otherwise, Foreign Taxes are required to be
         deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative
         Agent, the Guarantor agrees to pay such additional amounts to the
         Administrative Agent (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary to
         ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative
         Agent, after deduction of any Foreign Taxes imposed with respect to the
         payment of such Additional Amounts, shall equal the amount the
         Administrative Agent would have received if no Foreign Taxes had been
         deducted or withheld from such payment; provided, however, that no
         Additional Amounts shall be so payable for or on account of: (i) any
         Foreign Taxes which would not have been imposed but for the fact that
         any Bank: (A) had a present or former business connection with The
         Netherlands or any other jurisdiction from which payments are made, or
         any territory or political subdivision thereof (a "Foreign
         Jurisdiction") other than the mere ownership of, or receipt of payment
         under, the Notes; (B) presented such Notes for payment in any Foreign
         Jurisdiction unless such Notes could not have been


                                       3
<PAGE>


         presented for payment elsewhere; (C) presented a Note for payment more
         than fifteen (15) days after the date on which such payment became due
         and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
         whichever occurs later; or (D) did not provide to the Borrower correct
         or sufficient information to avoid any withholding of taxes; (ii) any
         estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar
         tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or (iii) any Foreign
         Taxes which are payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction.

8.       To the extent that the Guarantor or any of its respective properties,
         assets or revenues may have or may hereafter become entitled to, or
         have attributed to it, any right of immunity, on the grounds of
         sovereignty or other similar grounds, from any legal action, suit or
         proceeding in connection with or arising out of this Guaranty, from the
         giving of any relief thereunder, from set-off or counterclaim, from the
         jurisdiction of any court, from service of process, from attachment
         upon or prior to judgment, from attachment in aid of execution of
         judgment, or from execution of judgment or other legal process or
         proceeding for the giving of any relief or for the enforcement of any
         judgment, in any jurisdiction in which any proceeding may at any time
         be commenced, with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other
         matter under or arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty, the
         Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees for
         the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each Bank, not to plead or
         claim any such immunity, and consents to such relief and enforcement.

9.       This Guaranty embodies the final, entire agreement of Guarantor,
         Administrative Agent, and the Banks with respect to Guarantor's
         guaranty of the Guaranteed Indebtedness.


10.      This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
         laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. (without regard to the conflicts
         of laws provisions thereof other than Section 5-1401 of New York's
         General Obligations Laws), except with respect to authorization and
         execution by or on behalf of the Guarantor which are required to be
         governed by the laws of The Netherlands. The Guarantor agrees that any
         legal action, suit or proceeding against it arising out of or related
         to this Guaranty may be brought in the United States federal courts
         located in the Borough of Manhattan or the courts of the State of New
         York located in the Borough of Manhattan and hereby irrevocably accepts
         and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforementioned
         courts, in personam, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any
         suit, action or proceeding in connection with or arising out of this
         Guaranty for itself and its respective properties, assets and revenues.
         TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GUARANTOR HEREBY
         IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
         ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT
         OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY OR THE
         TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
         OR ANY BANK IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
         The Guarantor agrees that a final unappealable judgment in any action
         or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty shall be
         conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction otherwise
         having jurisdiction over the Guarantor by suit on the judgment or in
         any other manner provided by law.

11.      If any claim arising under or related to this Guaranty is reduced to a
         judgment in a currency other than the currency in which the Guaranteed
         Indebtedness is payable, the judgment shall be for the greater of (i)
         the equivalent in the currency in which the judgment is denominated of
         the amount of the claim as denominated in the currency in which the
         Guaranteed Indebtedness is payable, determined as of the date or


                                       4
<PAGE>


         dates the portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness related to such claim
         arose or was incurred by the Borrower or (ii) such equivalent in the
         currency in which the judgment is denominated determined as of the date
         of judgment. The equivalent amount of the foreign judgment currency
         shall be calculated at the spot rate for the purchase of that currency
         with the currency in which the Guaranteed Indebtedness is payable
         quoted by the Administrative Agent in New York, New York, at
         approximately 8:00 A.M. on the date for determination specified above.

12.      Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Banks
         against and hold the Administrative Agent and the Banks harmless from
         all loss and damage resulting from any change in exchange rates between
         the date any claim is reduced to judgment and the date of payment (or,
         in the case of partial payments, the date of each partial payment)
         thereof by Guarantor. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation
         separate and independent from the Guaranteed Indebtedness, shall give
         rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply
         irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Administrative Agent or
         any Bank from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect
         notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect
         of any amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

13.      No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty or consent to
         any departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be
         effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
         Administrative Agent, acting at the direction of the required number of
         Banks prescribed by the Short Term Revolving Credit Agreement or if the
         Short Term Revolving Credit Agreement is no longer in effect, the
         required number of Banks prescribed by the Long Term Revolving Credit
         Agreement.

14.      This Guaranty is for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the Banks,
         and their successors and assigns.

I5.      The Guarantor hereby consents to accept service of process at the
         offices of Allen & Overy, located at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New
         York, New York 10020 and acknowledges that process may be served in any
         suit or proceeding instituted in any Federal or State court located in
         the Borough of Manhattan arising out of or relating to this Guaranty,
         in accordance with legal procedures prescribed for such courts,
         provided that in the case of such service of process upon the process
         agent, the party effecting the service shall also deliver a copy
         thereof to Guarantor via overnight courier service to the attention of
         Group Treasury at AEGON N.V., AEGONplein 50, 2591 TV, The Hague, The
         Netherlands. Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the
         ability of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to serve any such legal
         process, summons, notices and documents in any other manner permitted
         by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Guarantor or bring
         actions, suits or proceedings against the Guarantor in such other
         jurisdictions, and in such manner, as may be permitted by applicable
         law.
