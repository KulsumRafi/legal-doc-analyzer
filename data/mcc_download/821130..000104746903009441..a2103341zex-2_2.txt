         SCHEDULE 4.8(e) and in items 1 and 2 on SCHEDULE 4.27) arising out of
         the operation prior to the Closing Date of the USCC Business or the

         with the matters disclosed on SCHEDULE 4.6(d)) arising prior to the

               (iii)    any non-current liabilities of the USCC Entities that
         are not specified in SECTION 1.2(a);

               (iv)     any liabilities and obligations arising at any time out

               (i)      all liabilities and obligations (including Taxes)

         of the AWS Assigned Licenses or the Partnership Interests; and

               (ii)     all liabilities and obligations arising after the
         Closing Date out of any Law of the FCC or any other Governmental

         Cost Sharing Obligations arising as a result of any prior coordination
         notice filed by any AWS Entity or any predecessor in interest in
         respect of the AWS Licenses prior to Closing.

         (d)   Neither USCC nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or undertake
in any way to perform, pay, satisfy or discharge any liability or obligation of
AWS or any of its Affiliates of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown,

         arising out of the use, ownership or operation prior to the Closing

                                       11
<Page>

               (ii)     any liabilities and obligations arising prior to the
         Closing Date out of any Law of the FCC or any other Governmental

               (iii)    any liabilities and obligations arising at any time out
         of any breach by any AWS Entity under this Agreement.

         Section 1.3.     LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE

         (a)   The parties shall cause the exchange of assets described in
Section 1.1 to be treated in such a manner that such exchange qualifies as an
exchange of multiple, like-kind assets to the maximum extent permitted by
Section 1031 of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
including this Section 1.3, each party acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has
obtained its own, separate tax advice with respect to the characterization of
the exchanges hereunder as like-kind exchanges of property under Section 1031 of
the Code, and (ii) is not relying on any representations of the other party with
respect to the characterization of the exchanges hereunder as like-kind
exchanges of property under Section 1031 of the Code.

         (b)   In furtherance of Section 1.3(a) hereof, AWS shall cooperate, if
requested, in enabling USCC or any USCC Entity to effectuate a like-kind
exchange through the assignment of all or any portion of the rights of USCC or
any such entity pursuant to this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4); provided, that none of
AWS's rights and none of USCC's obligations to AWS in respect of this Agreement
shall be diminished or otherwise affected by any such assignment.

         (c)   Within 60 days following the date hereof, USCC and AWS shall in
good faith negotiate and draft on a preliminary basis an allocation schedule
(the "ALLOCATION SCHEDULE") that will allocate the relative fair market values
of the assets to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.1, which allocation shall
take into account the Cash Payment. Within 30 days following the final
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount under Section 1.6, USCC
and AWS shall in good faith negotiate and finalize the Allocation Schedule. The
Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and in
accordance with any appraisal that the parties mutually determine to obtain. If
the parties mutually determine to obtain an appraisal in connection with the
Allocation Schedule, USCC and AWS shall jointly appoint an independent appraiser
to conduct and to deliver to USCC and AWS, as promptly as practicable, but no
later than 60 days after the engagement of the appraiser, an appraisal of the
fair market value at the time of the Closing of the exchanged assets, taking
into account the Cash Payment, as adjusted under Section 1.6. The cost of any
appraisal commissioned by the parties in order to value such assets for purposes
of this paragraph shall be shared equally by the parties. AWS and USCC agree to
cause all tax returns and reports relating to the Transactions, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8824 or Form 8594, as applicable, to be filed in
accordance with the values set forth on the final Allocation Schedule and not to
take any

                                       12
<Page>

position inconsistent therewith unless required to do so pursuant to a
"determination" as such term is defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

         Section 1.4.     LICENSE EXCHANGE OPTIONS

         (a)   AWS shall have the right at any time during the period that
begins on the Closing Date and ends on the second anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "EXCHANGE OPTION PERIOD") to require USCC to exchange (i) (x) the ten
MHz of broadband PCS spectrum covering Oklahoma City, OK (BTA 329) to be
assigned by AWS to USCC hereunder (the "ORIGINAL OKLAHOMA SPECTRUM") for (y) ten
MHz of broadband PCS spectrum (in the 1850-1990 MHz frequency range) covering
Oklahoma City, OK (BTA 329), acquired by AWS during the Exchange Option Period,
if any (the "OKLAHOMA EXCHANGE OPTION") and/or (ii) (x) the ten MHz of broadband
PCS spectrum covering Portland, ME (BTA 357) to be assigned by AWS to USCC
hereunder (the "ORIGINAL MAINE SPECTRUM") for (y) ten MHz of broadband PCS
spectrum (in the 1850-1990 MHz frequency range) covering Portland, ME (BTA 357),
acquired by AWS during the Exchange Option Period, if any (the "MAINE EXCHANGE
OPTION" and, together with the Oklahoma Exchange Option, the "EXCHANGE
OPTIONS").

         (b)   Each Exchange Option shall be exercisable by notice of election
given to USCC within the Exchange Option Period. If AWS does not timely exercise
an Exchange Option, such Exchange Option will terminate upon expiration of the
Exchange Option Period. Promptly after receipt of a notice of election, AWS and
USCC shall (subject to any necessary cooperation by AWS and USCC) prepare and
file with the FCC one or more assignment applications in respect of the
applicable spectrum, AWS shall prepare and deliver to USCC a License Exchange
Agreement in substantially the form of EXHIBIT A hereto in respect of the
applicable spectrum, and each party shall deliver to the other a duly executed
counterpart thereof. USCC and AWS will cooperate and use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to consummate any such exchange as promptly as possible. AWS will
reimburse USCC for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in effecting any
such exchange, including USCC's engineering costs and capital expenditures.

         (c)   From the Closing Date until expiration of the Exchange Option
Period, USCC shall and shall cause the applicable USCC Entity to (i) maintain
the FCC Licenses for the Original Oklahoma Spectrum and the Original Maine
Spectrum in full force and effect and (ii) maintain in full force and effect all
Governmental Authorizations necessary to preserve the ability to construct and
operate such FCC Licenses, as and when such Governmental Authorizations are or
become necessary for such purposes; provided, that neither USCC nor such USCC
Entity shall make, cause or permit to be made, any material commitments to any
Governmental Authority relating to any Governmental Authorization affecting the
FCC Licenses for the Original Oklahoma Spectrum and Original Maine Spectrum,
without the AWS's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Prior to the expiration of the Exchange Option Period, USCC
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, Transfer (or enter into any
agreement to Transfer) the Original Oklahoma Spectrum or the Original Maine
Spectrum, except for Transfers (i) to a wholly-owned subsidiary or (ii) in
connection with the

                                       13
<Page>

Transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of USCC in the State of
Oklahoma or the State of Maine, as applicable, provided, that prior to the
consummation of such Transfer, the purchaser or other transferee of such assets
assumes USCC's obligations under this Section pursuant to documentation in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to AWS. USCC acknowledges that money
damages would not be sufficient to compensate AWS for a breach by USCC of this
paragraph, and accordingly agrees that AWS shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of USCC's obligations under this paragraph and an injunction against
any Transfer sought to be effected in violation of such provisions.

         Section 1.5.     LICENSE CALL OPTIONS

         (a)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, USCC may elect,
by notice given to AWS no more than five Business Days after the date hereof, to
defer assignment of one or more of the AWS Assigned Licenses designated as
"SECTION 1.5 LICENSES" on Schedules I-A and I-B, in which event assignment
applications relating to such Section 1.5 Licenses will not be filed with the
FCC pursuant to Section 5.2(a), but such Section 1.5 Licenses shall be subject
to the provisions of this Section 1.5.

         (b)   At any time, and from time to time, during the period that begins
on the Closing Date and ends on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"SECTION 1.5 OPTION PERIOD"), USCC may elect, by written notice given to AWS
within the Section 1.5 Option Period (a "SECTION 1.5 EXERCISE NOTICE"), to
require AWS to assign to USCC any or all of the Section 1.5 Licenses in
accordance with this Section 1.5 (a "SECTION 1.5 OPTION"). If USCC fails to
exercise its Section 1.5 Option with respect to any Section 1.5 License in
compliance with this Section 1.5, AWS shall have no further obligation to USCC
in respect of such Section 1.5 License.

         (c)   Promptly after receipt of a Section 1.5 Exercise Notice in
respect of any Section 1.5 License, AWS shall (subject to any necessary
cooperation by USCC) prepare and file with the FCC an assignment application in
respect of such Section 1.5 License. Within ten Business Days after the FCC's
Consent to such assignment becomes a Final Order, AWS and USCC shall (or shall
cause the applicable AWS Entity or USCC Entity to) execute and deliver to each
other an instrument of assignment and assumption in substantially the form of
EXHIBIT G. USCC and AWS will cooperate and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to consummate any such assignment as promptly as possible.

         (d)   During the Section 1.5 Option Period: (i) AWS shall, and shall
cause the applicable AWS Entity to, maintain in full force and effect each
Section 1.5 License (or the original AWS License from which such Section 1.5
License will be disaggregated and/or partitioned), and all Governmental
Authorizations necessary to preserve the ability of USCC to construct and
operate such Section 1.5 License (or original AWS License), as and when such
Governmental Authorizations are or become necessary for such purposes; provided,
that neither AWS nor such AWS Entity shall make, cause or permit to be made, any
material commitments to any Governmental Authority relating to any Governmental
Authorization affecting any Section 1.5 License without USCC's prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (ii) AWS shall
satisfy, or cause to

                                       14
<Page>

be satisfied, the FCC's ten-year minimum build-out requirement, if any, and the
FCC's ten-year license renewal standards; provided that AWS shall not be
obligated to expend any funds to accomplish the same to the extent directly
related to such AWS Assigned License unless USCC agrees in writing to reimburse
AWS promptly for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that AWS may incur to
satisfy the FCC's ten-year minimum build-out requirement and/or the FCC's
ten-year license renewal standards directly related to an AWS Assigned License;
and (iii) AWS shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, Transfer (or
enter into any agreement to Transfer) any Section 1.5 License, except for
Transfers (x) in accordance with this Section 1.5, (y) to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AWS or (z) in connection with the Transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets or stock of AWS, provided, that prior to the consummation of
such Transfer, the purchaser or other transferee of such assets or stock assumes
AWS's obligations under this Section 1.5 pursuant to documentation in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to USCC. AWS acknowledges that money damages
would not be sufficient to compensate USCC for a breach by AWS of this
paragraph, and accordingly agrees that USCC shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of AWS's obligations under this paragraph and an injunction against
any Transfer sought to be effected in violation of such provisions.

         Section 1.6.     Working Capital Adjustment

         (a)   USCC shall deliver to AWS no later than two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date a statement in the format attached as SCHEDULE 1.6 setting
forth amounts as of the most recent practicable date prior to the Closing Date,
of all Current Assets and Current Liabilities, allocated between USCC and AWS in
the manner set forth on such attachment, together with USCC's good faith
estimate of the amount by which the Current Assets (defined below) of the USCC
Business as of the Closing Date exceeds the Current Liabilities (defined below)
of the USCC Business as of the Closing Date based on the methodology set forth
on the attachment to this Schedule ("PRELIMINARY CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL
AMOUNT"). (For illustrative purposes, SCHEDULE 1.6 is a completed statement
setting forth the Working Capital Amount as of January 31, 2003.) If the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount is positive, AWS shall pay to
USCC, at the Closing, in addition to the Cash Payment, cash in an amount equal
to such Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount. If the Preliminary
Closing Date Working Capital Amount is negative, the Cash Payment shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the absolute value of such Preliminary Closing
Date Working Capital Amount.

         (b)   Following Closing, the Cash Payment shall be adjusted (i)
downward, in the event the Closing Date Working Capital Amount (defined below)
is less than the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and (ii)
upward, in the event that the Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater
than the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount, all as finally
determined in accordance with the provisions set forth below. For purposes of
this Agreement, "CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNT" means the amount by which
the Current Assets (defined below) of the USCC Business as of the Closing Date
exceeds the Current Liabilities (defined below) of the USCC Business as of the
Closing Date based on the methodology set forth on the attachment to this
Schedule.

                                       15
<Page>

         (c)   As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no
event later than 60 days thereafter), AWS shall prepare and deliver to USCC for
its review and comment a schedule of working capital dated as of the Closing
Date setting forth the proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount (the
"WORKING CAPITAL SCHEDULE"). The Working Capital Schedule shall be prepared in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Schedule. For purposes of
preparing the Working Capital Schedule, from and after the Closing Date, USCC
shall provide AWS and its agents and representatives upon reasonable notice with
access to the books and records of USCC relating to, and personnel of USCC
knowledgeable about, the USCC Assets, the USCC Systems and the USCC Business to
the extent reasonably necessary to permit AWS to prepare the Working Capital
Schedule. If USCC objects to any amounts reflected on the Working Capital
Schedule prepared by AWS, USCC must, within 60 days after its receipt of the
Working Capital Schedule, give written notice (the "OBJECTION NOTICE") to AWS
specifying in reasonable detail its objections. If USCC has not given such
Objection Notice with respect to the Working Capital Schedule prepared by AWS
within such time period, AWS's determination of the Closing Date Working Capital
Adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. With respect
to any disputed amounts concerning the Working Capital Schedule, the parties
shall meet in person and negotiate in good faith during the 20 Business Day
period (the "RESOLUTION PERIOD") after the date of AWS's receipt of the
Objection Notice to resolve any such disputes. If the parties are unable to
resolve all such disputes within the Resolution Period, then within five
Business Days after the expiration of the Resolution Period, all disputes shall
be submitted to a mutually acceptable Big-4 Accounting Firm other than
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT") who shall be engaged to
provide a final and conclusive resolution of all unresolved disputes within 45
days after such engagement. The determination of the Independent Accountant
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto, and the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the parties.
From and after the Closing Date, AWS shall provide USCC and its agents and
representatives upon reasonable notice with access to the books and records of
AWS relating to, and personnel of AWS knowledgeable about, the USCC Assets, the
USCC Systems and the USCC Business to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
USCC to review the results of the Working Capital Schedule.

         (d)   For purposes of preparing the Working Capital Schedule, "CURRENT
ASSETS" shall include only the current assets identified on the attachment
hereto in the column labeled "USCC Assets" and "CURRENT LIABILITIES" shall
include only the current liabilities identified on the attachment hereto in the
column labeled "USCC Assumed Liabilities".

         (e)   If the Closing Date Working Capital Amount, as finally determined
in accordance with the provisions set forth above, is less than the Preliminary
Closing Date Working Capital Amount, the Cash Payment shall be adjusted downward
and USCC shall promptly reimburse to AWS in cash the difference between the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount plus interest on such difference from the Closing Date to the
date of payment at the Prime Rate on the Closing Date. If the Closing Date
Working Capital Amount, as finally determined in accordance with the provisions
set forth above, is greater than the

                                       16
<Page>

Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount, the Cash Payment shall be
adjusted upward and AWS shall promptly pay to USCC in cash the difference
between the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date
Working Capital Amount plus interest on such difference from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at the Prime Rate on the Closing Date. For purposes hereof,
"Prime Rate" shall mean the annual interest rate set forth as the Prime Rate in
the Money Rates table of The Wall Street Journal.

         (f)   The parties agree that all USCC Assets that are current shall be
included in the amount of Current Assets for purposes of determining the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount, and that USCC Assets shall not include any current assets that
are not included as Current Assets for purposes of determining the Preliminary
Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date Working Capital Amount
(it being understood that Current Assets shall not include any Excluded Assets).
The parties further agree that all USCC Assumed Liabilities that are current
shall be included in the amount of Current Liabilities for purposes of
determining the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Closing
Date Working Capital Amount, and that USCC Assumed Liabilities shall not include
any current liabilities that are not included as Current Liabilities for
purposes of determining the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount and
the Closing Date Working Capital Amount (it being understood that Current
Liabilities shall not include any USCC Excluded Liabilities).

         (g)   Consistent with the foregoing, the parties agree that any
accounts receivable or other current assets that have been written off by USCC
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice and/or which
are not included in the amount of Current Assets for purposes of determining the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount shall not be transferred to AWS and any recovery in respect
thereof after the Closing shall be for the benefit of USCC.

         (h)   Consistent with foregoing, (i) if either party receives or
collects any assets that are for the benefit of the other party, such party
shall hold such assets for the benefit of and promptly Transfer such assets to
the other party and (ii) if either party pays or performs any liabilities that
are for the account of the other party, such party shall promptly indemnify the
other party subject to the terms and conditions of Article 8.

         Section 1.7.     CERTAIN AGREEMENTS

         USCC shall have the rights described in SCHEDULE 1.7 with respect to
certain spectrum held by AWS.

         Section 3.1.     ORGANIZATION

         Each AWS Entity is a limited liability company or corporation, as the
case may be, and is duly organized, in good standing and validly existing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite limited
liability company or corporate, as the case may be, power and authority to enter
into each Transaction Document to which it is or shall be a party and consummate
the Transactions to which it is a party. Each AWS Entity is duly qualified as a
foreign entity in each of the jurisdictions where such qualification is required
by Law, except where the failure to be so qualified would not materially impair
its ability to hold the applicable AWS Licenses or to consummate the
Transactions to which it is a party.

         Section 3.2.     AUTHORITY

         With respect to each AWS Entity, the execution and delivery of each

consummation by it of the Transactions to which it is a party and the
performance by it of each Transaction Document to which it is or shall be a
party have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary limited liability
company or corporate, as applicable, action, and no other proceedings on its
part which have not been taken are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to which it is or shall be
a party or to consummate the Transactions to which it is a party.

         Section 3.3.     EXECUTION AND ENFORCEABILITY

<Page>

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium, and similar Laws of general applicability affecting the rights of
creditors and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

         Section 3.4.     NO CONFLICT OR CONSENTS

         Neither the execution, delivery and performance by any AWS Entity of
the Transaction Documents to which it is or shall be a party, nor the
consummation of the Transactions to which it is a party, will (i) conflict with,
or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
provision of its organizational documents; (ii) constitute, with or without the
giving of notice or passage of time or both, a breach, violation or default by
it, create a Lien, or give rise to any right of termination, modification,
cancellation, prepayment or acceleration, or a loss of rights, under (A) any Law
or Governmental Authorization or (B) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement or other instrument, in each case which is applicable to or binding
upon it or any of its assets; or (iii) require any action in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority or any Consent, other than filings under
the HSR Act, the Consent of the FCC and any applicable AWS State Consents,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), where such breach, violation,
default, Lien, right or the failure to obtain or give such Consent would not
have an AWS Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.5.     NO BROKER

         Neither AWS nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with any Person which will result in an obligation
to pay any finder's fee, brokerage commission or similar payment in connection
with the Transactions.

         Section 3.6.     FCC MATTERS

         (a)   Each AWS Entity listed on SCHEDULE I-A is the exclusive holder
of, and has good title to, free and clear of all Liens (other than the options
specifically identified in SCHEDULE 1.7), the AWS Entity License(s) set forth
opposite its name on SCHEDULE I-A. Each Non-AWS Entity listed on SCHEDULE I-B is
the exclusive holder of, and has good title, free and clear of all Liens, to the
Non-AWS Entity License(s) set forth opposite its name on SCHEDULE I-B. No Person
other than the applicable AWS Entity or Non-AWS Entity has any right, title or
interest (legal or beneficial) in or to the AWS License(s) set forth opposite
its name on SCHEDULE I-A or SCHEDULE I-B. Each AWS Entity License has been
granted to the applicable AWS Entity by Final Order and is in full force and
effect; as of the date hereof, each Non-AWS Entity License has been granted to
the applicable Non-AWS Entity by Final Order and is in full force and effect; as
of the Closing Date, each Non-AWS Entity License shall have been granted to the
applicable AWS Entity by Final Order and shall be in full force and effect. No
person other than the applicable AWS Entity is licensed to use, or otherwise has
a right to use, the AWS Entity license(s) set forth opposite its name on
SCHEDULE I-A. No person other than the applicable Non-AWS Entity is licensed to
use, or otherwise has a right to use, the Non-AWS Entity

                                       20
<Page>

license(s) set forth opposite its name on SCHEDULE I-B. No AWS Entity or any
Affiliate thereof has entered into any obligation, agreement, arrangement or
understanding to Transfer the AWS Licenses or that would adversely affect USCC's
ownership or use of the AWS Assigned Licenses after Closing. No Non-AWS Entity
or any Affiliate thereof has entered into any obligation, agreement, arrangement
or understanding to Transfer the Non-AWS Entity Licenses or that would adversely
affect USCC's ownership or use of the AWS Assigned Licenses after Closing. There
are no Interference Consents with respect to the AWS Licenses that are not
terminable by either party thereto on less than 60 days' advance notice.

         (b)   Except for proceedings affecting the wireless industry or
wireless licenses generally and as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.6(b), there is not
pending or, to the Knowledge of AWS, threatened against any AWS Entity, any
Non-AWS Entity or any of the AWS Licenses, nor does AWS have Knowledge of any
basis for, any application, action, complaint, claim, investigation, suit,
notice of violation, petition, objection or other pleading, or any proceeding
against any AWS Entity, the AWS Licenses, with the FCC or any other Governmental
Authority, which questions or contests the validity of, or seeks the revocation,
cancellation, forfeiture, non-renewal or suspension of, any of the AWS Licenses,
or which seeks the imposition of any modification or amendment thereof, or the
payment of a fine, sanction, penalty, damages or contribution in connection with
the use of any of the AWS Licenses by any AWS Entity holding such license,
except for any such application, action, complaint, claim, investigation, suit,
notice of violation, petition, objection, pleading, or proceeding that would not
have an AWS Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)   All material documents required to be filed at any time by any
AWS Entity or any Non-AWS Entity with the FCC or any other Governmental
Authority pursuant to FCC Law with respect to each of the AWS Licenses held
thereby have been timely filed or the time period for such filing has not
lapsed. All of such filings are complete and correct in all material respects.
None of the AWS Licenses is subject to any conditions other than those appearing
on its face and those imposed by FCC Law. All amounts owed to the FCC in
connection with the grant by the FCC of each of the AWS Licenses have been
timely paid and no further amounts are due to the FCC in respect of such AWS
Licenses. SCHEDULE 3.6(c) sets forth and describes all applications in respect
of the AWS Licenses pending or on file with a Governmental Authority; the
information contained in each such application is true and complete in all
material respects.

         (d)   No AWS Entity, any Affiliate of an AWS Entity, Non-AWS Entity or
any Affiliate of a Non-AWS Entity is in conflict with, or in default or
violation of, any Laws applicable to any AWS License (including, rules,
regulations and orders regarding implementation of CALEA, E911, number
portability, telephone service for the hearing impaired and other FCC Laws), and
each has complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the
AWS Licenses except where such conflict, default, violation or non-compliance
would not have an AWS Material Adverse Effect. No AWS Entity, any Affiliate of
an AWS Entity, Non-AWS Entity or any Affiliate of a Non-AWS Entity has received
written notice of any formal or informal complaint or order filed against it

                                       21
<Page>

alleging any material non-compliance by it with respect to any such Laws, in
each case to the extent applicable to the AWS Licenses.

         (e)   No AWS Entity or Non-AWS Entity is in breach or otherwise in
violation of any FCC buildout requirements with respect to the AWS Licenses held
by it, and each of the AWS Licenses has been built out at least to the minimum
extent required by 47 C.F.R. 24.203 or 47 C.F.R. 24.714, as applicable.
Certification of such minimum buildouts has in each case been made to and
granted by the FCC.

         (f)   Each AWS Entity is legally qualified to acquire and hold the USCC
License(s) to be acquired by such AWS Entity pursuant to this Agreement and to
receive and hold any Governmental Authorization necessary for it to acquire and
hold any such USCC License(s).

         (g)   Attached as SCHEDULE 3.6(g) is a true and correct list of each
and every microwave relocation agreement in respect of the AWS Licenses to which
any AWS Entity is a party or in respect of the Non-AWS Entity Licenses to which
an Non-AWS Entity is a party, and with respect to which either (x) the
applicable AWS Entity or Non-AWS Entity has not fully completed performance or
(y) the incumbent microwave licensee has not filed with the FCC (and provided to
the applicable AWS Entity or Non-AWS Entity the ULS file numbers of)
Applications or Notifications on Form 601 to relinquish its rights to the
microwave path(s) that are the subject of such agreement. AWS has provided USCC
with a complete copy of each microwave relocation agreement on SCHEDULE 3.6(g).
AWS has paid all AWS License Cost-Sharing Obligations of which it has been
notified by either of the two FCC sanctioned microwave reimbursement
clearinghouses.

         Section 3.7.     LITIGATION REGARDING THE AWS LICENSES

         There are no civil, criminal or administrative claims, actions, suits,
demands, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of AWS,
threatened against any AWS Entity or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
Non-AWS Entity, relating to any of the AWS Licenses or any other properties or
assets of any AWS Entity or any Non-AWS Entity, that would if determined
adversely to such AWS Entity or Affiliate or Non-AWS Entity have an AWS Material
Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
outstanding against any AWS Entity or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
Non-AWS Entity, relating to or involving any of the AWS Licenses, nor does AWS
have Knowledge of any reasonable basis therefor, and there are no unsatisfied

Non-AWS Entity, with respect to any of the AWS Licenses or any other properties

         The USCC Entities specified on SCHEDULE 4.9, collectively, are the
owners (whether by leasehold or fee simple interest) of, and have good title to,
all of the USCC Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.
The USCC Assets are in satisfactory repair and operating condition (subject to
normal wear and tear). The USCC Assets, together with the Excluded Assets and
the services to be provided and assets to be made available to AWS pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement, constitute all of the rights, assets and
properties required to operate the USCC Systems in all material respects as they
are currently operated.

         Section 4.10.    REAL PROPERTY

         (a)   SCHEDULE 4.10(a) lists all Real Property owned by a USCC Entity
and principally used or held for use in connection with the operation of the
USCC Systems in the USCC Service Area, and specifies the address and/or legal
description sufficient to identify the property and contains a reasonable
description of the use of each property. With respect to each parcel of owned
Real Property included in the USCC Assets, except as set forth on SCHEDULE
4.10(a):

               (i)      the applicable USCC Entity has good title to the parcel
         of Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
         Liens;

               (ii)     except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.10(b), there are no
         leases, subleases, licenses, concessions, or other agreements to which
         a USCC Entity is a party and which relate to the operation of the USCC
         Systems in the USCC Service Areas or, to the Knowledge of USCC, leases,
         subleases, licenses, concessions or other

                                       29
<Page>

         agreements to which any USCC Entity is not a party, granting to any
         person the right of use or occupancy of any portion of the parcel of
         Real Property;

               (iii)    there are no outstanding options or rights of first
         refusal to purchase the parcel of Real Property, or any portion thereof
         or interest therein;

               (iv)     to the Knowledge of USCC, the applicable USCC Entity has
         physical and legal ingress and egress to and from such parcel; and

               (v)      no USCC Entity has received any written notice of, and
         USCC has no Knowledge of, any material non-compliance with applicable
         building codes, zoning regulations, occupational health and safety Laws
         or any other Laws, applicable to such parcel or the applicable USCC
         Entity's use or occupancy thereof.

         (b)   SCHEDULE 4.10(b) lists all Real Property leases and occupancy
and/or use agreements (together with any amendments thereto) with respect to
which a USCC Entity is tenant, lessee, licensee or grantee (the "REAL PROPERTY
LEASES") and which cover Real Property principally used, or held for use, in
connection with the operation of USCC Systems in the USCC Service Area (the
"LEASED PROPERTY"). USCC has made available to AWS complete and correct copies
of each of the Real Property Leases (together with any subleases granted with
respect to the Real Property covered by the Real Property Leases). Each Real
Property Lease that has not expired in accordance with its terms is legal,
valid, binding and enforceable against the applicable USCC Entity in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium, and
similar Laws of general applicability affecting the rights of creditors and
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Neither the USCC Entity party
to any Real Property Lease nor, to the Knowledge of USCC, any other party
thereto is in default, violation or breach of any material term of such Real
Property Lease and no USCC Entity has received any written notice of default
thereunder. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.10(b), no USCC Entity has
subleased, licensed or otherwise granted the right to use or occupy any Real
Property leased by any USCC Entity or any portion thereof to any other Person.

         (c)   No improvements on any Real Property owned by any USCC Entity
encroach upon adjoining real estate, and all such improvements have been
constructed in conformity with all "setback" lines, easements and other
restrictions, or rights of record, that have been established by any applicable
building or zoning ordinances, except those encroachments and violations which
would not reasonably be expected to interfere in any material respect with the
use, occupancy or operation of the USCC Assets as currently used, occupied or
operated.

         Section 4.11.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         (a)   Except for (i) Intellectual Property made available to AWS,
either directly or indirectly in connection with services provided to AWS,
pursuant to the USCC Brand

                                       30
<Page>

License Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) Intellectual
Property (if any) used by the USCC Entities pursuant to any USCC System
Contract, (iii) Intellectual Property (such as software) incorporated into
tangible USCC Assets (such as switches), freely transferable to the AWS Entities
without Consent of, or material payment to, any third party and (iv) incidental
Intellectual Property used in the operation of the USCC Systems (such as
standard shrink wrap licenses which typically accompany commercially available
software), there is no Intellectual Property that is required to operate the
USCC Systems in all material respects as they are currently operated.

         (b)   SCHEDULE 4.11(b) contains a complete and correct list of all
Intellectual Property to be transferred or otherwise made available by any USCC
Entity to an AWS Entity in connection with the Transactions (the "USCC
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"). The USCC Intellectual Property does not include any
Intellectual Property which is solely owned by USCC or an Affiliate thereof, or
any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by USCC or an Affiliate thereof
which has been developed or customized, either by USCC or an Affiliate thereof
or at its request. To the extent transferable, the USCC Entity which is the
licensee, lessee or user thereof has the right to use pursuant to license,
sublicense, agreement or permission, the USCC Intellectual Property set forth
opposite its name on SCHEDULE 4.11(b), free and clear of all liens and free from
any requirement of any past, present or future royalty payments, license fees,
charges or other payments, but subject to the terms of use and limitations in
such licenses.

         (c)   To the extent transferable by any USCC Entity, from and after
Closing, AWS will have the right to use all of the incidental intellectual
property used in the operation of the USCC Systems. In the case of any
incidental intellectual property used in the operation of the USCC Systems which
had been used by any USCC Entity as a licensee or lessee, AWS' use of said
incidental intellectual property shall be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable license or lease agreement free from any
pre-existing payment restriction or liens.

         (d)   Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.11(d), no claim or demand of
any Person has been made nor is there any proceeding that is pending, or to the
Knowledge of USCC, threatened, nor does USCC have Knowledge of any reasonable
basis therefor, which (A) challenges the rights of any USCC Entity in respect of
any USCC Intellectual Property, (B) asserts that any USCC Entity is infringing
or otherwise in conflict with, or is required to pay any royalty, license fee,
charge or other amount with regard to, any USCC Intellectual Property, or (C)
claims that any default exists under any agreement or arrangement listed in
SCHEDULE 4.11(d) with respect to USCC Intellectual Property which default would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate result in a
USCC Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.12.    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

         Neither USCC nor any Affiliate thereof is in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, any Laws applicable to the operation of the USCC
Systems or the USCC Assets, except where such conflict, default or violation
would not reasonably be expected to have a USCC Material Adverse Effect. Neither
USCC nor any Affiliate thereof has

                                       31
<Page>

received notice of any formal or informal complaint or order filed against USCC
or any Affiliate thereof alleging any material non-compliance by USCC or any
Affiliate thereof with respect to any such Laws, in each case to the extent
applicable to the operation of the USCC Systems or the USCC Assets.

         Section 4.13.    GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS

         SCHEDULE 4.13 sets forth a true and complete list of all material
Governmental Authorizations (other than FCC Licenses) relating solely and
directly to the USCC Systems (collectively, the "SYSTEM PERMITS"). All System
Permits are validly held by the USCC Entity specified on SCHEDULE 4.13 and in
good standing and in full force and effect, such USCC Entity is in substantial
compliance with each System Permit granted to or held by it (except for such
instances of non-compliance that would not result in the loss or non-renewal of
the applicable System Permit or a USCC Material Adverse Effect), and, except as
set forth on SCHEDULE 4.13, the same are transferable to AWS pursuant to this
Agreement and will not be subject to suspension, modification or revocation as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions. No event has occurred with
respect to any of the System Permits which permits, or after notice, or lapse of
time (except for the expiration of a System Permit in accordance with its
terms), or both, would permit, revocation or termination thereof or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a USCC
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.14.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         (a)   Each Employee Plan maintained or sponsored by, or contributed to

USCC Systems (the "SYSTEM EMPLOYEE PLANS") has been in all material respects
maintained and operated by USCC or its ERISA Affiliates in conformity with all
applicable Laws, including but not limited to the Code and the Employee

severance pay, sick leave, vacation pay, salary continuation for disability,
hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, and scholarship program, and
(B) "ERISA AFFILIATE" means any entity which, together with another entity,
would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section
4001 of ERISA.

         (b)   With respect to employees employed in operating the USCC Systems,
neither USCC nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof sponsors, has sponsored,
contributes to, has contributed to, or has or had an obligation to contribute to
(A) a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or (B) a multiple
employer plan subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA which could reasonably
result in any liability to any AWS Entity.

favorable determination letter has been received from the IRS or a request for a
determination letter has been or will be timely filed under applicable guidance
from the IRS and is currently pending with the IRS.

         (e)   All contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of
the System Employee Plans or by law (without regard to any waivers granted under
Section 412 of the Code) to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith have been made by USCC or its ERISA Affiliates by the due
date thereof (including any valid extension), and all contributions for any
period which are not yet due will be paid by the required due date. No
accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any System Employee Plan subject to
Section 412 of the Code.

         (f)   No event has occurred nor shall any event occur as a result of
the Transactions which could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition
upon AWS or any Affiliate or ERISA Affiliate of AWS of any liability or any lien
against any of their assets, directly or indirectly, as a "successor employer"
or otherwise, attributable to or relating to the System Employee Plans or any
other Employee Plan maintained or sponsored by, or contributed to by, USCC or
its ERISA Affiliates, including, without limitation, any funding requirements
under the Code or liabilities under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any such
plans.

         (g)   There is no material violation of ERISA with respect to the
filing of applicable reports, documents and notices regarding the System
Employee Plans with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury or
the furnishing of such documents to the participants or beneficiaries of the
System Employee Plans which could reasonably result in any liability to any AWS
Entity.

         (h)   There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits with respect to
the operation of the System Employee Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits) which have been asserted or instituted against USCC or any of its
ERISA Affiliates, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the plan
sponsor, plan administrator, or any fiduciary of the System Employee Plans, nor

"disqualified person" with respect to the System Employee Plans has engaged in a
non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA which could reasonably result in any liability to
any AWS Entity.

                                       33
<Page>

System Employee Plan has complied in all material respects with the notice and
coverage continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (and any similar state law), Section
4980B of the Code, and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the
regulations thereunder.

         (k)   No USCC Entity nor any Affiliate thereof has any formal plan or
commitment, whether or not legally binding, to create any additional Employee
Plan or modify or change any existing System Employee Plan in a manner that
would impose liability on any AWS Entity or any Affiliate thereof, nor has any
intention to do so been communicated to any employees of USCC who perform
services for the USCC Systems or their dependents, survivors or beneficiaries.

employment pursuant to Section 6.1(a).

         (e)   There are no employment or severance agreements which are binding

Systems. To the Knowledge of USCC, no work stoppage, picketing, hand billing,
consumer boycott, labor strike, dispute or slow-down exists or has been
threatened against any USCC Entity with respect to the USCC Systems. Each USCC
Entity is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal,

USCC Systems. Each of such permits, licenses and other authorizations is valid
and enforceable and in full force and effect, and each USCC Entity is in
compliance with the material terms and conditions of all such permits, licenses
and other authorizations and with each Environmental Law. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.17(a), there are no pending applications for any permits, licenses or
other authorizations under any Environmental Law in connection with the conduct

failure to grant or approve would have a material adverse affect on the
operation of the USCC Systems.

         (b)   (i) No Hazardous Substances generated by, used by, or originating
from activities of the USCC Systems or the USCC Assets have been Released or, to
the Knowledge of USCC, threatened to be Released into the environment, whether

other analyses conducted by or on behalf of, and that are in the possession of,
any USCC Entity in relation to any USCC Asset now or previously owned, operated,
occupied, utilized or leased by such USCC Entity. No USCC Entity has received
any notice of intention to commence suit under any Environmental Law with
respect to the USCC Systems or the USCC Assets (and to the Knowledge of USCC,
there is no reasonable basis for any such suit), nor has any USCC Entity
received any request for information from any Governmental Authority under any
Environmental Law with respect to the USCC Systems or the USCC Assets. With
respect to the USCC Systems, there is no existing, pending or, to the Knowledge
of USCC, threatened action, suit, investigation, inquiry or proceeding under
Environmental Laws by or before any Governmental Authority, nor any remedial
obligations, arising under any Environmental Laws.

         (c)   Each USCC Entity has complied and is in compliance in all
material respects with all Environmental Permits and all applicable
Environmental Laws pertaining to the USCC Assets and the USCC Systems, and, to
the Knowledge of USCC, no USCC Entity has any liability, contingent or
otherwise, under any Environmental Law which, individually or in the aggregate
could have a USCC Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of USCC, no Person
has alleged any violation by any USCC Entity of any applicable Environmental Law
relating to the operation of the USCC Systems or the use, ownership, operation
or transferability of any USCC Assets. No USCC Entity has caused or permitted
the use, management, generation, manufacture, refining, transportation,
treatment, storage, handling, disposal, production or processing of any
Hazardous Substances in connection with the operation of the USCC Systems or any
USCC Asset except in compliance with Environmental Law, and no USCC Entity has
caused or permitted, and USCC has no Knowledge of, the Release or threatened
Release of any Hazardous Substances generated, used or originating from the
operations of the USCC Systems or any USCC Asset.

         (d)   The assets, property and equipment of each USCC Entity and Real
Property now or previously owned, operated, occupied, utilized or leased by such
USCC Entity with respect to the USCC Systems transferred to AWS or an Affiliate
thereof in accordance with this Agreement are not subject to any Liens under any
Environmental Law, and to the Knowledge of USCC no basis exists for any such
Liens.

         (e)   To the extent applicable, each USCC Entity's operations of the
USCC Systems and the USCC Assets are in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of OSHA and any state and local occupational safety
and health Laws, and all regulations promulgated thereunder and there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of USCC, threatened safety and/or health citations,
complaints, lawsuits or orders issued with respect to any of the foregoing Laws.
There have been no citations, notices or complaints issued to any USCC Entity or
any Affiliate thereof with respect to the USCC Systems or the USCC Assets by
OSHA or any state occupational safety and health administration which could
individually or in the aggregate result in a USCC Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.18.    AGREEMENTS, CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS

         (a)   USCC has made available to AWS a correct and complete copy of
each contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment, understanding, lease, license
or other instrument to which a USCC Entity or an Affiliate thereof is a party
(or in the case of (i) any oral USCC Contract, a true, complete, and correct
summary thereof, and (ii) each individual Subscriber Agreement between the
applicable USCC Entity and the applicable subscriber, true, complete and correct
copies of the standard forms of Subscriber Agreements), in each case principally
related and material to the operation of the USCC Systems, together with any and
all amendments or modifications thereto through and including the date hereof
(each, a "USCC CONTRACT"). Each USCC Contract is valid, binding, enforceable and
in full force and effect; the applicable USCC Entity or Affiliate is not in
breach or default under any such USCC Contract; and, to the Knowledge of USCC,
no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would

                                       37
<Page>

constitute a breach or default, or permit termination, modification or
acceleration, under such USCC Contract, except where the failure to be so valid,
binding, enforceable or in full force and effect or such breach or default,
termination, modification or acceleration would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a USCC Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)   SCHEDULE 4.18(b) sets forth each USCC Contract included in the
USCC Assets (the "USCC SYSTEM CONTRACTS"). SCHEDULE 4.18(b) also sets forth all
necessary Consents (including Consents to assignment) of parties to all USCC
System Contracts which are required in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (collectively, the "USCC SYSTEM CONSENTS").

         Section 4.19.    BOOKS OF ACCOUNT

         All financial, business and accounting books, ledgers, accounts and
official and other records relating to the USCC Systems and the USCC Assets
(collectively, the "BOOKS AND RECORDS") (i) have been properly and accurately
kept and maintained in accordance with applicable Law, (ii) are true, complete
and correct in all material respects and do not contain or reflect any material
inaccuracies or discrepancies and (iii) fairly reflect in reasonable detail the
material assets, liabilities and transactions relating to the USCC Systems.

         Section 4.20.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         USCC has delivered to AWS complete and correct copies of (i) the
unaudited financial statements of the USCC Systems as of, and for the periods
ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, each of which include balance
sheet and related statement of income for the year then ended (the "FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS") and (ii) the unaudited financial statements of the USCC Systems at
December 31, 2002 (the "BALANCE SHEET DATE") including a balance sheet and
related statements of income for the twelve (12) month period then ended (the
"INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial Statements and the Interim
Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects, in accordance with
GAAP, the financial position of the USCC Systems and the results of their
operations for the periods specified therein (subject to the absence of
footnotes and, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, to normal year
end audit adjustments.)

         Section 4.21.    ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

         No USCC Entity has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and
whether due or to become due, arising out of or relating to the USCC Systems or
any of the USCC Assets, except as reflected or reserved for, and only to the
extent reflected or reserved for, in the Financial Statements and the Interim
Financial Statements and except (i) as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.21, (ii) for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the Balance Sheet Date and in each case to the extent permitted
to be incurred in accordance with the terms hereof and (iii) executory
obligations under any USCC Contract.

                                       38
<Page>

         Section 4.22.    ABSENCE OF CHANGES OR EVENTS

         Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any (i) USCC Material
Adverse Effect; and (ii) except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.22, none of USCC or
any Affiliate thereof has (with respect to the USCC Business): (A) discharged or
satisfied any Lien or paid any liabilities other than in the ordinary course of
the operation of the USCC Business consistent with past practice, or failed to
pay or discharge when due any liabilities; (B) sold, encumbered, assigned,
transferred or otherwise disposed of any assets or properties (including rights
or interests with respect to such assets or properties) which any USCC Entity
purported to own as of the Balance Sheet Date or on any date since such date,
except in the ordinary course of the operation of the USCC Business consistent
with past practice; (C) incurred any indebtedness (or made any guaranties in
respect thereof) for which a AWS Entity will be liable following the Closing
Date or subjected any of the assets or properties owned by a USCC Entity to any
Lien other than a Permitted Lien; (D) made or suffered any amendment or
termination of any USCC Contract, or canceled, modified or waived any
substantial debts or claims held by it or waived any rights of substantial
value, except in the ordinary course of the operation of the USCC Business
consistent with past practice; (E) changed any of the accounting principles
followed by any USCC Entity relating to the operation of the USCC Systems or the
methods of applying such principles or made or changed any Tax elections
relating to the operation of the USCC Systems; (F) entered into any transaction,
except in the ordinary course of the operation of the USCC Business consistent
with past practice; or (G) agreed, orally or in writing, or granted any other
person an option, to do any of the things specified in subparagraphs (A) through
(F) above.

         Section 4.23.    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

         The Accounts Receivable as of January 31, 2003 are set forth on
SCHEDULE 1.6, which sets forth a calculation of the reserves in respect of such
Accounts Receivable and the USCC methodology used in such calculation. All
Accounts Receivable, whether reflected on the Financial Statements, the Interim
Financial Statements or SCHEDULE 1.6 or subsequently created, have arisen from
bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business. The reserves in
respect thereof reflected on the Financial Statements and the Interim Financial
Statements are appropriate in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with prior periods. No USCC Entity has taken any actions with the intended
effect of accelerating and has not sought to accelerate the payment of any of
the Accounts Receivable in a manner inconsistent with USCC's practice during
prior periods. No USCC Entity has settled or compromised any Accounts Receivable
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with USCC's practice during
prior periods.

         Section 4.24.    INVENTORIES

         The Inventories as of the Balance Sheet Date, together with the
locations thereof, are set forth in SCHEDULE 4.24. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.24, all Inventories are of good, usable and merchantable quality in
all material respects and, except to the extent adequately reserved for, do not
include items which have been discontinued or are off specification, damaged,
dormant, obsolete, non-salable, non-usable or not first quality.

                                       39
<Page>

All Inventories are of such quality as to meet the quality control standards of
USCC. All Inventories are recorded on SCHEDULE 1.6 at the lower of cost or
market value determined in accordance with GAAP. No mobile phones included in
Inventory are system operator code (SOC) "locked" to search for a system
operator code on a preferred or exclusive basis, and the intercarrier roamer
data base (IRDB) for all mobile phones included in Inventory is reprogrammable
by any wireless carrier assuming such carrier has over the air programming
capabilities and uses time division multiple access (TDMA) technology.

         Section 4.25.    MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT

         Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.25, all items of Machinery and
Equipment are in good operating condition, ordinary wear, tear and natural
depreciation excepted. To the Knowledge of USCC, there are no material repairs
necessary with respect thereto other than routine maintenance in the ordinary
course.

         Section 4.26.    CELL SITES

         SCHEDULE 4.26 lists each cell site (including each cell site on which a
USCC Entity has placed one or more antennas) (a "CELL SITE") currently operated
or used by each USCC Entity in respect of the USCC Systems as of the date
hereof, indicating the address of such Cell Site, whether such USCC Entity is
the owner of such Cell Site, and whether any other Person is permitted to
co-locate towers or antennas thereon or has any other rights with respect
thereto. SCHEDULE 4.26 also sets forth (i) each instance where a USCC Entity
co-locates its antennas relating to the USCC Systems on another Person's tower
or antenna structure and (ii) whether any antenna structure on which a USCC
Entity locates antennas is one which requires notification to the FAA under 47
C.F.R. 17.17 and, if so, the Antenna Structure Registration Number thereof. Each
of the Cell Sites has been constructed, and is operating, substantially in
compliance with the terms and conditions of the USCC Assigned Licenses and the
rules and regulations of all applicable Governmental Authorities, including the
FCC and the FAA, and each USCC Entity has made all filings, tower registrations
and reports relating to each Cell Site, except where the failure to make such
filings, tower registrations or reports would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a USCC Material Adverse Effect, and all
such filings, reports and registrations are accurate in all material respects.

         Section 4.27.    LITIGATION REGARDING USCC SYSTEMS, USCC ASSETS

         Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.27, there are no civil, criminal or
administrative claims, actions, suits, demands, proceedings or investigations
pending or, to the Knowledge of USCC, threatened against USCC or any Affiliate
thereof relating to the USCC Systems or any USCC Assets that would, if
determined adversely to USCC or such Affiliate, reasonably be expected to have a
USCC Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.27, there is no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order outstanding against USCC or any
Affiliate thereof relating to or involving the USCC Systems or any of the USCC
Assets, nor does USCC have Knowledge of any reasonable basis therefor, and there
are no unsatisfied judgments against USCC or any Affiliate

                                       40
<Page>

thereof with respect to the USCC Systems or any of the USCC Assets, in each case
that would reasonably be expected to have a USCC Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.28.    LIABILITY TO AFFILIATES

         Neither the USCC Assets nor the USCC Assumed Liabilities include any
agreements, arrangements or understandings with, or rights or obligations in
favor of, any USCC Entity, except (i) as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (ii) as disclosed on SCHEDULE 4.28
or (iii) as may be terminated at will or upon no more than 90 days' notice as of
the Closing Date without Consent of, or material payment to, any third party,
and without impairing in any material respect the operation of the USCC Assets
or the USCC Systems after the Closing.

         Section 4.29.    CALEA

         Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.29 with respect to the USCC Systems,
there has been validly and timely filed a Flexible Deployment Submission with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the "FBI") in accordance with the FBI's
Flexible Deployment Assistance Guide, and a Petition for Extension with the FCC
requesting an extension of the current CALEA capability compliance deadline with
respect to the USCC Systems until the applicable dates set forth on SCHEDULE
4.29.

         Section 4.30.    INSURANCE

         The USCC Assets will be covered until Closing by commercially
reasonable policies of casualty, liability, and other forms of insurance owned
or held by USCC or an Affiliate thereof. Such policies are in full force and
effect and will remain in full force and effect through the Closing Date in
accordance with their terms (and AWS acknowledges that no USCC Entity shall have
any obligation to continue any such insurance or self-funding arrangements
following Closing). No notice of cancellation has been received, and there is no
existing default, or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default thereunder by USCC or an Affiliate thereof. All
premiums to date have been, and all premiums due and payable as of the Closing
Date will be, paid in full.

         Section 4.31.    BUSINESS ACTIVITY RESTRICTION

         Except as set on SCHEDULE 4.31, there is no non-competition or other
agreement, commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree to which USCC or an
Affiliate thereof is a party or subject that does or would reasonably be
expected to interfere in any material respect with the use, occupancy or
operation of the USCC Assets.

         Section 4.32.    USCC ENTITIES

         USCC directly, or indirectly, beneficially owns all of the outstanding
equity interests of each USCC Entity.

                            COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

         Section 5.1.     COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

         Each party covenants and agrees from and after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until the Closing Date, as follows:

         (a)   It shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, promptly all actions and to do, or cause to be done, promptly
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Transactions and to fulfill its obligations hereunder, including causing to be
satisfied at the earliest practical date all conditions contained in Article 7
to be satisfied by it.

         (b)   It shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, refrain
from taking any action which could be reasonably expected to render any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect.

         (c)   It shall, and shall cause, in the case of AWS, each applicable
AWS Entity to and in the case of USCC, each applicable USCC Entity to, comply in
all material respects with all applicable Laws and Governmental Authorizations
relating to the USCC Assigned Licenses and the USCC Systems, in the case of
USCC, and the AWS Licenses and Partnership Interests, in the case of AWS.

         (d)   USCC shall, and shall cause each applicable USCC Entity to, in
the case of the USCC Assigned Licenses and the USCC Systems, and AWS shall, and
shall cause each applicable AWS Entity to, in the case of the AWS Licenses, (A)
maintain such FCC Licenses in full force and effect and (B) maintain in full
force and effect all Governmental Authorizations necessary to preserve the
ability to construct and operate such FCC Licenses and, in the case of USCC, the
USCC Systems, as and when such Governmental Authorizations are or become
necessary for such purposes; provided, that neither USCC, in the case of any
USCC Entity, nor AWS, in the case of any AWS Entity, shall make, cause or permit
to be made, any material commitments to any Governmental Authority relating to
any Governmental Authorization affecting, in the case of USCC, the USCC Assigned
Licenses or the USCC Systems, and in the case of AWS, the AWS Licenses, without
the other party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit
AWS from taking any action or omitting to take any action with respect to any
frequencies which are not included in any AWS Assigned License created by
disaggregating an AWS License, or any service areas which are not covered by any
AWS Assigned License created by partitioning an AWS License, so long as the
taking of such action or omission to take such action does not otherwise result
in a breach by AWS of this Section 5.1(d).

         (e)   It shall:

               (i)      Give written notice to the other party promptly upon the
         commencement of, or upon obtaining Knowledge of any facts that would
         give rise

                                       42
<Page>

         to a threat of, any claim, action or proceeding commenced against or
         relating to it, its Affiliates or its or their properties or assets
         which would reasonably be expected to have a USCC Material Adverse
         Effect (in the case of USCC) or an AWS Material Adverse Effect (in the
         case of AWS);

               (ii)     After obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence of any
         event, or any occurrence which would reasonably be expected to give
         rise to an event, which could cause or constitute a material breach of
         any of its warranties, representations, covenants or agreements
         contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, promptly
         give notice in writing of such occurrence or event to the other party
         and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prevent or to promptly
         remedy such breach; and

               (iii)    Advise the other party promptly in writing of (x) any
         event, condition or state of facts known to it, which, after the date
         hereof, would reasonably be expected to have a USCC Material Adverse
         Effect (in the case of USCC) or an AWS Material Adverse Effect (in the
         case of AWS) or (y) any claim, action or proceeding which seeks to
         enjoin or otherwise challenge the consummation of the Transactions.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosure by a party pursuant to
this Section 5.1(e) shall be deemed to amend or supplement this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or to cure any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, representation, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document.

         Section 5.2.     CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES

         Each party covenants and agrees, from and after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until the Closing Date, as follows:

         (a)   Promptly following execution of this Agreement (but in no event
later than 15 Business Days after the date hereof), it shall file or cause to be
filed with the FCC all appropriate applications for Consent to the assignment of
the FCC License(s) (other than the Section 1.5 Licenses) and the USCC Assets
contemplated hereby. It shall cooperate with the other party and use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prosecute or cause to be prosecuted all such
applications to a favorable conclusion, and shall work with the other party to
file or cause to be filed all required notices of consummation with the FCC. No
party shall take or cause to be taken any action before the FCC which is
inconsistent with or intended to delay action on such applications or
consummation of the Transactions. Each AWS Entity and each USCC Entity,
respectively, shall bear its own costs associated with the preparation and
submission of such filings.

         (b)   AWS, on behalf of the AWS Entities, and USCC, on behalf of the
USCC Entities, shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to secure before
the Closing Date any Consent (other than the Consent of the FCC), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the other party, from any Governmental
Authority as is necessary to be obtained by it in order to consummate the
Transactions. AWS, on behalf of the AWS

                                       43
<Page>

Entities, and USCC, on behalf of the USCC Entities, shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the other party, as reasonably requested,
to obtain such Consents.

         (c)   USCC shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain all
of the USCC System Consents prior to Closing. If any USCC System Consent is not
obtained prior to Closing, and Closing occurs, the applicable USCC System
Contract (a "NON-ASSIGNED CONTRACT") shall not be assigned, but (A) USCC shall
continue to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts following Closing to obtain
such USCC System Consent, whereupon, once obtained, the applicable Non-Assigned
Contract shall be deemed automatically assigned to AWS without any further
action required of the parties hereto and (B) until such Non-Assigned Contract
is assigned to AWS or such Non-Assigned Contract's expiration, whichever occurs
first, USCC shall cause such Non-Assigned Contract to be kept in effect and
shall cause the benefit of such Non-Assigned Contract to be provided to the
applicable AWS Entity to the same extent as if it had been assigned including
(x) causing any rights of the applicable USCC Entity arising from such
Non-Assigned Contract to be enforced against the issuers thereof or the other
party or parties thereto; (y) causing to be taken all such actions and causing
to be done all such things at the request and (to the extent AWS would have been
responsible for such costs had the applicable Non-Assigned Contract been
assigned to AWS at Closing) cost of AWS as shall be reasonably necessary and
proper in order that the value of any Non-Assigned Contract shall be preserved
and shall inure to the benefit of AWS; and (z) causing to be paid over to AWS
all monies or other assets collected by or paid to the applicable USCC Entity in
respect of such Non-Assigned Contract. AWS shall be responsible for the
performance of all obligations under any such Non-Assigned Contract that AWS
would have been responsible therefor had Consent to assignment of the
Non-Assigned Contract been obtained, but only to the extent that AWS receives
the benefits under any such Non-Assigned Contract that AWS would have received
had Consent to assignment of the Non-Assigned Contract been obtained. Nothing in
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be construed as an
attempt to assign any agreement or other instrument that is by its terms
non-assignable without the consent of the other party.

         (d)   USCC and AWS shall each cooperate and use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to prepare and file with the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")
and the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") within 10 Business Days
after the date hereof, all requisite applications and amendments thereto
together with related information, data and exhibits necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR ACT") (if applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). USCC and AWS shall each pay their own filing fees in connection with
any filings pursuant to this Section 5.2(d).

         Section 5.3.     PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS

         The parties agree that between the date of execution of this Agreement
and the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1, none of the parties, or their respective
Representatives, will directly or indirectly

                                       44
<Page>

solicit, encourage or initiate the submission of proposals or offers from,
provide any confidential information to, or participate in discussions or
negotiations or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any
Person concerning the Transfer of, or create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien
of any nature whatsoever in respect of, in the case of (i) USCC, the USCC
Assigned Licenses or the USCC Assets (other than solely in the case of the USCC
Assets, Permitted Liens or as otherwise permitted by Section 5.6) and (ii) AWS,
the AWS Licenses; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit AWS from
taking any action or omitting to take any action with respect to any frequencies
which are not included in any AWS Assigned License created by disaggregating an
AWS License, or any service areas which are not covered by any AWS Assigned
License created by partitioning an AWS License, so long as the taking of such
action or omission to take such action does not otherwise result in a breach by
AWS of this Section 5.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict a party from the Transfer of the assets which
are otherwise required to be conveyed by it at Closing to a third party,
provided, that any such Transfer must be pursuant to another transaction in
which (x) such assets, taken as a whole, constitute an immaterial or incidental
portion of the assets being transferred, assigned or disposed of pursuant to
such other transaction and (y) the acquirer or the assignee or transferee of
such assets (whether by operation of law or otherwise) expressly agrees and is
obligated to consummate or cause the consummation of the Transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof, without delay or impairment to the
Transactions.

         Section 5.4.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         (a)   Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives to,
(A) retain in strictest confidence any and all Confidential Information relating
to the other party that it receives in connection with the negotiation or
performance of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document (whether
received prior to or after the date of this Agreement), and (B) not disclose
such Confidential Information to anyone except (x) the receiving party's
Affiliates and Representatives and (y) any other Person that needs to know such
Information for purposes of performance of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document and who agrees to keep in confidence all Confidential
Information in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.4 as if it were the
receiving party hereunder. Each party agrees to use Confidential Information
received from the other party only in furtherance of the performance of this
Agreement, and not for any other purpose. All Confidential Information furnished
pursuant to this Agreement and each other Transaction Document shall either be
returned promptly to the party to whom it belongs, or destroyed and such
destruction certified, in either case upon request made prior to Closing by such
party.

         (b)   The obligations set forth in paragraph (a) above shall not apply
to Confidential Information that (A) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by the receiving party or its
Affiliates or its Representatives in violation of this Section 5.4, (B) was
available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis prior to its
disclosure to the receiving party, or (C) becomes available to the receiving
party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the providing party
or its Representatives, provided, that such source is not known by the receiving

                                       45
<Page>

party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the providing party or its
Representatives. Confidential Information with respect to the USCC Assets shall
be deemed to be Confidential Information of AWS, from and after the Closing.

         (c)   Anything else in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
notwithstanding, each party shall have the right to disclose any information,
including Confidential Information of the other party or such other party's
Affiliates: (A) to its Representatives (such Representatives to acknowledge that
any such Confidential Information disclosed to them is subject to the provisions
hereof); (B) in any filing with any regulatory agency, court, or other authority
(in confidence where a procedure for confidential disclosure exists) or any
disclosure to a trustee of public debt of a party to the extent that the
disclosing party determines in good faith that it is required by Law or the
terms of such debt to do so; provided, that any such disclosure shall be as
limited in scope as possible and shall be made only after giving the other party
as much notice as practicable of such required disclosure and an opportunity to
contest such disclosure, or seek confidential treatment, if possible; (C) as
required by its existing or potential lending sources (such lending sources to
acknowledge that any such Confidential Information disclosed to them is subject
to the provisions hereof); or (D) as required to enforce its rights under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document.

         (d)   The parties agree that except as may be necessary to comply with
the requirements of applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties or its
Affiliates is listed, no press release or similar public announcement or
communication will be made or caused to be made concerning the execution of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the consummation of the
Transactions, provided, that in the case of any disclosure permitted under this
paragraph (d), the disclosing party shall (A) prior to the proposed disclosure,
permit the non-disclosing party to review and comment on such proposed
disclosure and (B) not publish or otherwise release to the public any proposed
disclosure unless the non-disclosing party has first approved the same, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         Section 5.5.     ACCESS AND INFORMATION

         (a)   From the date hereof until Closing, USCC shall, and shall cause
the USCC Entities to, give AWS and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the USCC Assets, and
to records, books, contracts and documents related to the USCC Assets or the
USCC Systems, and to such other information related to the USCC Assets or the
USCC Systems as AWS may reasonably request, and in each case to the extent
reasonably necessary to Transfer to AWS the ownership of the USCC Assets and the
operation of the USCC Systems. Any such access shall be coordinated through Mark
Wierzbinski, USCC Director of Partner Relations (office telephone: (773)
399-4951) or another individual appointed by USCC to AWS in writing. Neither AWS
nor its Representatives shall contact any employees of the USCC Systems without
first obtaining the consent of Mr. Wierzbinski or any other appointed
individual. USCC shall cause the appropriate officers, employees, consultants,
agents, accountants and attorneys of the USCC Entities to cooperate with AWS and
its

                                       46
<Page>

Representatives in connection with such access. This Section 5.5(a) shall not
entitle AWS to receive or review, or have access to, information that (x) is
subject to a confidentiality agreement with a third party, provided, that USCC
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Consent of any such
third party to permit AWS to receive and review such information or (y) USCC
reasonably believes to be competitively sensitive.

         (b)   From the date hereof until Closing, AWS shall, and shall cause
the AWS Entities to, give USCC and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the AWS Licenses, and
to records, books, contracts and documents related to the AWS Licenses, and such
other information related to the AWS Licenses as USCC may reasonably request,
and in each case to the extent reasonably necessary to Transfer to USCC the AWS
Assigned Licenses. Any such access shall be coordinated through Carol Dellecker
(office telephone: (425) 580-8007) or another individual appointed by AWS to
USCC in writing. Neither USCC nor its Representatives shall contact any
employees of AWS without first obtaining the consent of Ms. Dellecker or any
other appointed individual. AWS shall cause the appropriate officers, employees,
consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys of the AWS Entities to cooperate
with USCC and its Representatives in connection with such access. This Section
5.5(b) shall not entitle USCC to receive or review, or have access to,
information that (x) is subject to a confidentiality agreement with a third
party, provided, that AWS shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain
the Consent of any such third party to permit USCC to receive and review such
information or (y) AWS reasonably believes to be competitively sensitive.

         Section 5.6.     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

         During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, USCC covenants and agrees that it shall, and shall cause each
USCC Entity to, operate the USCC Systems in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. In furtherance, but without limitation, of the
foregoing, USCC shall, and shall cause each USCC Entity to:

         (a)   maintain the USCC Assets and operate the USCC Systems in the

<Page>

         (d)   preserve in full force and effect, as necessary and consistent
with past practice, all Governmental Authorizations relating to the operation of
the USCC Systems, including the timely renewal thereof, in each case where the
failure to so preserve such Governmental Authorizations in full force and effect
would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a USCC
Material Adverse Effect;

         (e)   use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to preserve its
relationships with all parties to the USCC System Contracts, and perform in all
material respects all of its obligations thereunder, according to the terms and

the existing insurance policies for the USCC Systems (or comparable policies),
except for any changes to such policies that are made in the ordinary course of
business; provided that nothing herein shall obligate USCC to obtain or to
continue any insurance coverage for any period after the Closing. USCC will
provide AWS with information and records that AWS may reasonably request that
are material to such claims now pending or made hereafter with respect to the
USCC Assets.

         Section 5.7.     NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         With respect to the USCC Systems, during the period from the date
hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, USCC shall not take, and
shall cause each USCC Entity not to take, any of the following actions relating
to the USCC Assets or USCC Systems without the prior written consent of AWS:

         (a)   enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding involving
payments, projected revenues, assets, or liabilities with a value in excess of
$250,000 in the aggregate, or materially alter, amend, or modify or terminate,
or exercise any option under, any existing agreement involving payments,
projected revenues, assets, or liabilities with a value in excess of $250,000 in

         (d)   make or agree to make any material change in the employment
arrangements of any Designated Employee or enter into any new agreement with any
Designated Employee which would create or impose any liability or obligation on
the part of AWS (other than the customary annual increases in the base rate of
pay of Designated Employees);

         (e)   enter into any contracts with any Affiliate which will be binding
upon AWS after Closing;

         (f)   fail to pay when due any liability or obligations that, if
unpaid, would become a Lien upon any of the USCC Assets;

         (g)   with the exception of any changes required by Law or affecting
all or substantially all of the wireless systems owned by USCC nation-wide,
implement any material change in (x) the terms and conditions of any Subscriber
Agreements or (y) the types or quality of products and services provided to
subscribers;

         (h)   except as required by Law, enter into any collective bargaining
agreement, or make any commitment whatsoever to any union or other
representative or party which intends to represent any employees of the USCC
Systems;

         (i)   change its accounting practices except as required by GAAP or,
subject to contemporaneous written notice, affecting all or substantially all of
the wireless systems owned by USCC nationwide; or

         (j)   authorize or enter into an agreement in contravention of any of
the foregoing.

         USCC shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to give AWS
contemporaneous notice of any material action relating to the USCC Assets or
USCC Systems taken prior to Closing pursuant to paragraph (g), (h) or (i) above.

         Section 5.8.     RISK OF LOSS

         Risk of loss with respect to the USCC Assets shall not pass to AWS
until Closing has occurred.

         Section 5.9.     CASUALTY INSURANCE PROCEEDS

         In the event that any of the USCC Assets have been damaged prior to the
Closing Date by a casualty covered by insurance ("DAMAGED ASSETS"), USCC shall
(prior to and following Closing) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to collect
amounts due (if any)

                                       49
<Page>

in respect of such Damaged Assets under applicable insurance policies, which
amounts, (i) if collected prior to Closing, will be used to repair or replace
the Damaged Assets and (ii) if collected following Closing, will be remitted to
AWS.

         Section 5.10.    TAX MATTERS

         (a)   At Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due, Taxes
arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions, other than income taxes and
franchise taxes ("TRANSACTION TAXES") shall be paid as follows: (i) USCC shall
pay, or cause to be paid, Transaction Taxes, if any, assessed on any USCC
Entity, as the seller of the USCC Assets, the USCC Systems or the USCC Business
and any Transaction Taxes, if any, assessed on any USCC Entity, as the buyer of
the AWS Assigned Licenses or the Partnership Interests; (ii) AWS shall pay, or
cause to be paid, Transaction Taxes, if any, assessed on any AWS Entity, as the
seller of the AWS Assigned Licenses and the Partnership Interests, and
Transaction Taxes, if any, assessed on any AWS Entity, as the buyer of the USCC
Assets, the USCC System or the USCC Business; and (iii) all other Transaction
Taxes, whether assessed on any USCC Entity or any AWS Entity, shall be paid
one-half by AWS, or a designated Affiliate, and paid one-half by USCC, or a
designated Affiliate. The parties agree to cooperate with each other to take
advantage of all applicable Transaction Tax exemptions and provide all
documentation and information reasonably necessary to obtain such exemptions.

         (b)   Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.10(b), all Taxes, including
real estate, personal property, public service company taxes and any special
taxes or assessments attributable to the USCC Assets for the fiscal year during
which the Closing Date occurs, that are by their nature attributable to the
entire fiscal year or a period that includes but does not end on the Closing
Date, shall be allocated proportionately to the portion of such fiscal year or
other period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such fiscal year or
other period after the Closing Date. In the case of any Taxes attributable to
taxable periods beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (the
"STRADDLE PERIOD"), the amount of (A) personal, real and intangible property
Taxes for the pre-Closing period shall be equal to the amount of such property
Taxes attributable to the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in
the pre-Closing period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (B) Taxes (other than property Taxes) for the
pre-Closing period shall be computed as if such period ended on the Closing
Date. Any such Taxes allocated to the pre-Closing period, to the extent such
Taxes remained unpaid as of the Closing Date shall be paid by USCC when and as
due. Any such Taxes allocated to the post-Closing period shall be paid by AWS
when and as due. The amount of any pre-payment by USCC in respect of such Taxes
shall be reimbursed promptly to USCC to the extent such pre-payment is allocated
to the post-Closing period.

         Section 5.11.    POST-EXECUTION CONTRACTS

         In the event that, following the date hereof and prior to Closing, USCC
enters into a contract or other agreement material to the operation of the USCC
Systems (in each case, a "POST-EXECUTION CONTRACT"), USCC shall immediately
provide AWS with a fully

                                       50
<Page>

executed copy of such Post-Execution Contract whereupon AWS may, in its
reasonable discretion, designate in writing such Post-Execution Contract as a
USCC System Contract to be included in the USCC Assets. In the event AWS does
not so designate such Post-Execution Contract a USCC System Contract it shall be
deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of
clarification, AWS acknowledges and agrees that it would not be reasonable for
it to reject a Post-Execution Contract which contains commercially reasonable
terms.

         Section 5.12.    BUILDOUT REQUIREMENTS

         Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.2 to the contrary, with respect
to the AWS Assigned Licenses that have been, or will be, established by
disaggregating and/or partitioning A and B block AWS Licenses (a) AWS shall
satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, the ten-year coverage requirement under 47
C.F.R. 24.203 or 47 C.F.R. 24.714, as applicable, for the entire A or B block
license area with respect to each A and B block AWS License, whether
disaggregated and/or partitioned prior to or after the date of this Agreement
(including the partitioned license area with respect to each AWS Assigned
License established by such disaggregating and/or partitioning; it being
understood, however, that AWS shall not have any obligation to construct any
facilities in, or provide any RF coverage to, the partitioned license area with
respect to any AWS Assigned License established by such disaggregating and/or
partitioning), and (b) with respect to each AWS Assigned License assigned to any
USCC Entity in accordance with this Agreement prior to the end of the initial
ten-year license term with respect to such AWS Assigned License, USCC shall
satisfy the substantial service requirement for license renewal expectancy for
the partitioned license area with respect to each such AWS Assigned License
prior to the end of such initial ten-year license term, and (c) AWS shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates and each Non-AWS Entity not to, take any action
to establish a Section 1.5 License by disaggregating and/or partitioning A and B
block AWS Licenses, except in furtherance of the assignment of such Section 1.5
License to a USCC Entity pursuant to USCC's exercise of its Section 1.5 Option
with respect to such Section 1.5 License or unless AWS agrees to satisfy at
AWS's expense the substantial service requirement for license renewal expectancy
for the partitioned license area with respect to such Section 1.5 License until
the earlier of (x) the assignment of such Section 1.5 License to USCC in
accordance with Section 1.5 and (y) the expiration of the Section 1.5 Option in
respect of such Section 1.5 License. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
parties agree to select Option 2 in response to Question 6, and Option 3 in
response to Question 7, on Schedule B to each Form 603 filed with the FCC in
respect of each such AWS Assigned Licenses.

         Section 5.13.    MICROWAVE CLEARING

         (a)   AWS shall be entitled to receive and retain all cost-sharing
reimbursement payments made by third parties after Closing with respect to any
microwave relocation costs incurred in respect of the AWS Licenses by any AWS
Entity. USCC shall be entitled to receive and retain all cost-sharing
reimbursement payments made by third parties after Closing with respect to any
microwave relocation costs incurred in respect of the AWS Assigned Licenses by
any USCC Entity.

                                       51
<Page>

         (b)   AWS agrees that it will promptly pay all AWS License Cost-Sharing
Obligations arising as a result of any prior coordination notice filed by any
AWS Entity or any predecessor in interest in respect of the AWS Licenses. USCC
agrees that it will promptly pay all AWS License Cost-Sharing Obligations
arising as a result of any prior coordination notice filed by any USCC Entity in
respect of the AWS Assigned Licenses.

         (c)   AWS will reimburse USCC promptly upon presentation by USCC of a
reasonably detailed invoice for (i) any reasonable out-of-pocket microwave
relocation costs incurred by any USCC Entity in respect of the AWS Assigned
Licenses during the period that begins on the Closing Date and ends on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) subject to the second sentence of
Section 5.13(b) above, for all cost sharing reimbursement payments incurred by
any USCC Entity in respect of the AWS Assigned Licenses during the period that
begins on the Closing Date and ends on the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date.

         Section 5.14.    ACQUISITION OF NON-AWS ENTITY LICENSES

         (a)   Prior to the Closing Date, AWS or an AWS Entity shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to acquire each of the Non-AWS Entity Licenses
pursuant to the Non-AWS Entity License Acquisition Agreements. If AWS is for any
reason unable to acquire any Non-AWS Entity License prior to the Closing Date,
AWS shall assign or cause to be assigned to USCC, in lieu of such Non-AWS Entity
License, alternate broadband PCS spectrum in the same market and with the same
bandwidth (in the frequency range of 1850-1990 MHz). In such event, AWS shall
prepare and promptly file with the FCC an assignment application in respect of
such alternate spectrum and AWS and USCC shall cooperate and use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to consummate the assignment to USCC of such alternate
spectrum in accordance with this Agreement.

         (b)   SCHEDULE I-A identifies the AWS Assigned Licenses that will not
be assigned by AWS to USCC at the Closing, but will be assigned at a subsequent
closing, which shall take place no later than six months from the date of this
Agreement and shall be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions
provided in Section 2.2, to the same extent as if such assignment had been
effected on the Closing Date.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                      EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         Section 6.1.     TRANSITIONED EMPLOYEES

         (a)   SCHEDULE 6.1(a) contains a list of all persons employed by USCC
in the operation of the USCC Systems as of the date of this Agreement. AWS will
be obligated to offer employment in accordance with the terms of this Article 6
to all of the persons listed on SCHEDULE 6.1(a) who are still employed as of the
Closing Date and any additional persons who are hired by USCC prior to the
Closing Date to replace any persons listed on Schedule 6.1(a) who are separated
from employment prior to the Closing Date and are still employed as of the
Closing Date (all of such persons herein

                                       52
<Page>

referred to as the "DESIGNATED EMPLOYEES"). Effective as of the Closing Date,
USCC shall terminate the employment of, and AWS shall offer employment to, all
Designated Employees who are actively at work or ready to return to work as of
the Closing Date (an "ACTIVE EMPLOYEE"). Any Designated Employee who is not
actively at work and not ready to return to work as of the Closing Date (an
"INACTIVE EMPLOYEE") shall not be offered employment by AWS, nor be deemed to be
a Transitioned Employee as defined below, unless and until he or she is ready to
return to active work within 180 days of the Closing Date and gives notice to
AWS in writing thereof. AWS shall promptly offer such Inactive Employee
employment following receipt of such notice on substantially the same terms as
similarly situated Transitioned Employees, the start-date of such Inactive
Employee to be within ten work days (the actual start date to be at the
discretion of AWS) after AWS has received the Inactive Employee's acceptance of
AWS's employment offer. For purposes of this Agreement, all Active Employees who
accept an employment offer from AWS and all Inactive Employees who subsequently
become ready to return to active work within 180 days of the Closing Date who
accept AWS's employment offer are herein collectively referred to as the
"TRANSITIONED EMPLOYEES." Each such Transitioned Employee shall be employed by
AWS at substantially the same base rate of pay (which excludes, among other
types of pay, sales commissions, bonuses, extraordinary pay and any other type
of pay not included as part of the base salary rate or hourly rate of pay)
received by such Transitioned Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or
immediately prior to becoming an Inactive Employee. The other terms and
conditions of employment of the Transitioned Employee shall be substantially
similar to the terms and conditions of employment provided to similarly situated
employees of AWS. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Agreement limits
the rights of AWS to eliminate or change the conditions of employment, for any
reason after hiring the Transitioned Employee, as AWS may, in its sole
discretion, unilaterally implement.

         (b)   The participation of each Transitioned Employee in the System
Employee Plans will terminate effective upon the Closing Date, except with
respect to compensation and benefits that remain payable or due under the terms
of such System Employee Plans, or except as otherwise required by Law or such
System Employee Plans. Nothing in this Agreement creates or is intended to
create any rights in third parties or third party beneficiaries, including,
without limitation, any rights to be employed or respecting the terms and
duration of employment.

         (c)   USCC shall be responsible for any and all salaries, wages,
benefits, notices and other compensation or payments (including commissions and
bonuses, if any) payable to each Designated Employee for services attributable
to, and claims and expenses incurred during, the period ending as of 11:59 p.m.
Chicago time on the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the USCC compensation arrangements and policies and the System Employee Plans,
and AWS shall not be responsible for any such obligations as a "successor
employer" or otherwise. AWS shall be responsible for any and all salaries,
wages, benefits, notices and other compensation or payments payable to each
Transitioned Employee for services rendered to AWS for the period commencing as
of 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on the Closing Date.

                                       53
<Page>

         Section 6.2.     HEALTH, WELFARE AND RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

         (a)   For the period commencing as of 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on the
Closing Date, AWS will cover each Transitioned Employee under its own "employee
welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and other fringe
benefit plans, programs or arrangements (collectively "AWS WELFARE PLANS"), so
that each such Transitioned Employee is entitled to benefits under such AWS
Welfare Plans comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of
AWS, including specifically any applicable state mandated coverage for medical,
dental, vision, prescription drug and short-term disability. The AWS Welfare
Plans, as well as AWS's paid time off or vacation plans and programs, as the
case may be, shall provide that each Transitioned Employee's period of
employment recognized by USCC prior to the Closing Date shall be credited under
such AWS Welfare Plans and paid time off or vacation plans and programs, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, waiting periods, vacation or paid time
off accrual levels. AWS shall cause all Transitioned Employees to be credited
with any amounts paid under the System Employee Plans prior to the Closing Date
toward satisfaction of deductible amounts and copayments, coinsurance and out of
pocket maximums under any corresponding AWS Welfare Plans, but only to the
extent such payments would have been taken into account under the System
Employee Plans and such crediting is approved by AWS's insurers and service
providers, as reasonably needed. Nothing contained herein shall prevent AWS from
making changes to AWS Welfare Plans with respect to any Transitioned Employee
after the Closing Date. With respect to worker's compensation benefits, USCC
accepts continuing responsibility after the Closing Date for payment of all
benefits to or on behalf of workers for (a) claims accepted or in process on or
prior to the Closing Date, and (b) claims related to industrial injuries or
occupational diseases for which a right to file for worker's compensation
benefits existed or accrued on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that USCC
is provided notice of such claim and the opportunity to manage or defend such
claim.

         (b)   For the period commencing as of 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on the
Closing Date, AWS will cover each Transitioned Employee under the AT&T Wireless
401(k) Savings Plan, or a comparable plan, so that each such Transitioned
Employee is entitled to benefits under AWS Pension Plans comparable to those
provided to similarly situated employees of AWS.

         (c)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed to restrict AWS from
operating its existing employee benefit plans, including full authority to amend
or terminate such plans in accordance with their respective terms and applicable
Laws.

         (d)   USCC agrees to provide or cause to be provided to AWS all such
records and information as AWS may reasonably request in order to carry out the
intent of, and to meet AWS's obligations under, this Section 6.2.

         (e)   On or before the date required by Law, USCC shall cash out all
accrued and unused vacation days of Transitioned Employees. AWS shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to allow each employee to utilize the equivalent
amount of such vacation days as paid out by USCC, on an unpaid basis, up to ten
working days

                                       54
<Page>

maximum. The use of this unpaid vacation days shall be based on management
discretion and subject to business needs and normal scheduling practices.

         (f)   USCC shall remain solely responsible for any and all liabilities
relating to or arising in connection with the requirements of Section 4980B of
the Code, to provide continuation of health care coverage in respect of
Transitioned Employees and their covered dependents due to coverage under the
System Employee Plans.

         (g)   On or before the date required by Law, USCC shall contribute to
the accounts of the applicable Transitioned Employees under the applicable
System Employee Plan all amounts required by such System Employee Plan to be
contributed with respect to such Transitioned Employee on account of any period
prior to Closing.

         Section 6.3.     EMPLOYMENT TAXES

         USCC and AWS will (i) treat AWS as a "successor employer" and USCC or
the applicable Affiliate thereof as a "predecessor" within the meaning of
Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code with respect to Transitioned
Employees for purposes of taxes imposed under the United States Federal
Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act
and (ii) cooperate with each other to avoid, to the extent possible, the filing
of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to each Transitioned Employee for the
calendar year within which the Closing occurs.

         Section 6.4.     WARN ACT

         USCC shall comply and cause compliance with the provisions of the WARN
Act and any other federal, state, or local Laws regarding "plant closings,"
"mass layoffs" (or similar triggering event), or change of control, with respect
to any employment loss (as defined in the WARN Act) to employees employed in
operating the USCC Systems that occurs on or before 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on
the Closing Date. AWS shall comply and cause compliance with the provisions of
the WARN Act and any other Laws regarding "plant closings," "mass layoffs" (or

         Section 8.1.     SURVIVAL

         (a)   All of the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement, and in the certificates delivered pursuant to
Sections 7.1(a) and 7.2(a), shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full

<Page>

         expiration date of the relevant statute of limitations period (without
         regard to any extension thereof by action or agreement of the party
         seeking indemnification);

provided, that if any claim, action, suit or proceeding, arising out of facts or
circumstances constituting a breach of a Type 1 Representation, is brought or
commenced by any third party or Governmental Authority (including an FCC
enforcement action), whether before or after the third anniversary of the

action, suit or proceeding) shall survive until the earlier to occur of the 60th
day following the expiration date of the relevant statute of limitations period
(without regard to any extension thereof by action or agreement of the party

         (b)   All indemnification obligations with respect to representations
and warranties under this Agreement shall terminate as of the expiration of the

made in writing prior to such expiration.

         (c)   Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 10.12,
following the Closing the indemnification provided for by this Article 8 shall

         From and after the Closing, USCC shall indemnify AWS and its

against, and hold each harmless from, any and all demands, claims, losses,
liabilities, actions or causes of action, assessments, damages, fines, taxes
(including excise and penalty taxes), penalties, reasonable costs and expenses
(including interest, reasonable expenses of investigation, reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, accountants and other experts, whether the same relate
to claims, actions or causes of action asserted by any indemnified Person
against the indemnitor or asserted by third parties) (collectively, "LOSSES")
incurred or suffered by any AWS Indemnitee arising out of:

         (a)   any misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of any
USCC Entity under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or any
misrepresentation in or omission from any schedule (including without limitation
the USCC Disclosure Schedule), exhibit, certificate, instrument or other
document furnished to AWS pursuant hereto or thereto;

                                       59

         (b)   any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of any USCC
Entity under this Agreement or any Transaction Document;

         (c)   any claims, actions, suits or proceedings by third parties or
Governmental Authority (including an FCC enforcement action) relating to or
arising out of or in connection with the ownership or operation by any USCC
Entity or any Affiliate thereof (i) prior to Closing, of the USCC Assigned
Licenses, the USCC Assets or the USCC Systems and (ii) after the Closing, of the
AWS Assigned Licenses and the Partnership Interests (other than, in respect of
this clause (ii), any of the foregoing in respect of which AWS has an
indemnification obligation under Section 8.3); or

Excluded Assets (including the ownership or operation of such Excluded Assets at
any time by USCC or any Affiliate thereof).

         Section 8.3.     INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION OF AWS

         From and after the Closing, AWS shall indemnify USCC and its
Affiliates, and its and their respective successors and assigns, and the
shareholders, members, directors, managers, officers, employees and agents of
any of the foregoing (each, a "USCC INDEMNITEE"), on an After-Tax Basis,
against, and hold each harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
any USCC Indemnitee arising out of:

         (a)   any misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of any
AWS Entity under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or any
misrepresentation in or omission from any schedule (including without limitation
the AWS Disclosure Schedule), exhibit, certificate, instrument or other document
furnished to USCC pursuant hereto or thereto;

         (b)   any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of any AWS
Entity under this Agreement or any Transaction Document;

         (c)   any claims, actions, suits or proceedings by third parties or
Governmental Authority (including an FCC enforcement action) relating to or

Entity or any Affiliate thereof (i) prior to Closing, of the AWS Licenses or the
Partnership Interests, or (ii) after the Closing, of the USCC Assigned Licenses,
USCC Assets or the USCC Systems (other than, in respect of this clause (ii), any
of the foregoing in respect of which USCC has an indemnification obligation
under Section 8.2); or

         (d)   any USCC Assumed Liabilities or AWS Excluded Liabilities.

         Section 8.4.     LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY FOR LOSSES

         (a)   In no event shall either party hereto be liable for indirect,
special, consequential or punitive damages arising out of this Agreement,
regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty, strict
liability or tort, including negligence of

                                       60
<Page>

any kind, whether active or passive, and regardless of whether the other party
knew of or was advised at the time of breach of the possibility of such damages.

         (b)   No indemnification under Section 8.2(a) for any Losses suffered
by the AWS Indemnitees shall be required to be made by USCC until the aggregate
amount of the Losses suffered by the AWS Indemnitees exceeds $1,250,000 (the
"DEDUCTIBLE"), and then indemnification shall be required to be made by USCC for
all such Losses in excess of the Deductible, but subject to the other provisions
of this Section 8.4; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
any intentional breach of a representation or warranty, or to any breach of a
Type 1 Representation or a Type 2 Representation.

         (c)   No indemnification under Section 8.3(a) for any Losses suffered
by the USCC Indemnitees shall be required to be made by AWS until the aggregate
amount of the Losses suffered by the USCC Indemnitees exceeds the Deductible,
and then indemnification shall be required to be made by AWS for all such Losses
in excess of the Deductible, but subject to the other provisions of this Section
8.4; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any intentional
breach of a representation or warranty, or to any breach of a Type 1
Representation or a Type 2 Representation.

         (d)   The maximum amount of Losses for which a party may be obligated
to provide indemnification with respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty shall be $65,000,000 in the aggregate; provided that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any intentional breach of a representation or
warranty, or to any breach of a Type 1 Representation or Type 2 Representation.

         (e)   USCC shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to Section
8.2(a) or (c) arising from a USCC Material Adverse Effect, but only if USCC
discloses to AWS such USCC Material Adverse Effect in writing promptly after
USCC becomes aware of such USCC Material Adverse Effect, and AWS waives such
USCC Material Adverse Effect in writing and consummates the Closing; provided,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any intentional breach of a
representation or warranty made by USCC on the date hereof.

         (f)   AWS shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
or (c) arising from an AWS Material Adverse Effect, but only if AWS discloses to
USCC such AWS Material Adverse Effect in writing promptly after AWS becomes
aware of such AWS Material Adverse Effect, and USCC waives such AWS Material
Adverse Effect in writing and consummates the Closing; provided, that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to any intentional breach of a
representation or warranty made by AWS on the date hereof.

         (g)   In connection with any claim for indemnification under this
Article 8, there shall be a presumption, as between the parties, that the
Indemnified Party did not, prior to Closing, have Knowledge of the facts giving
rise to such claim, which presumption may be rebutted only by clear and
convincing evidence to the contrary.

                                       61
<Page>

         Section 8.5.     NOTICE OF CLAIMS

         Any party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") seeking indemnification under this
Article 8 shall give to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (the "INDEMNITOR") a written notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder (a "CLAIM") and shall include in such Claim Notice (if
then known) the amount, or the method of computation of the amount, of such
Claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement,
document or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon
which such Claim is based; provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any
action at law or suit in equity by or against a third party as to which
indemnification will be sought must be given promptly after the action or suit
is commenced; provided, further that if such Claim Notice is given prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, failure to promptly give such
Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

         Section 8.6.     THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

         (a)   If any claim, action or suit by a third party arises after
execution and delivery of this Agreement for which a Claim is made, then the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor in accordance with Section 8.5 and
shall give the Indemnitor a reasonable opportunity (i) to conduct any
proceedings or negotiations in connection therewith and necessary or appropriate
to defend the Indemnified Party, (ii) to employ counsel to contest any such
claim, action or suit in the name of the Indemnified Party or otherwise and
(iii) to take all other required steps or proceedings to settle or defend any
such claim, action or suit.

         (b)   The expenses of all proceedings, contests or lawsuits with
respect to any claims, actions or suits for which a Claim is made shall be borne
by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor wishes to assume the defense of any such
claim, action or suit, then it shall give written notice to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice (unless the claim,
action or suit reasonably requires a response in less than 30 days after the
Claim Notice is given to the Indemnitor, in which event the Indemnitor shall
notify the Indemnified Party at least 10 days prior to such reasonably required
response date), and the Indemnitor shall thereafter assume the defense of any
such claim, action or suit, through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control the defense of the claim, action or suit unless and until the Indemnitor
shall (i) assume the defense of such claim, action or suit, and (ii) acknowledge
in writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnitor shall be obligated under
the terms of its indemnity hereunder to the Indemnified Party in connection with
such claim, action or suit, in which event the Indemnitor shall have the right
to control such defense; provided, that the Indemnitor may not settle or
compromise such claim, action or suit without the Indemnified Party's prior
written consent unless the terms of such settlement or compromise
unconditionally discharge and release the Indemnified Party from any and all
liabilities and obligations thereunder and do not

                                       62
<Page>

involve any remedy other than the payment of money solely by the Indemnitor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the defendants in any action shall include
both an Indemnitor and an Indemnified Party, and (ii) such Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by Indemnitor has a
material conflict of interest because of the availability of different or
additional defenses to such Indemnified Party, and (iii) either (A) counsel
shall have advised Indemnified Party that the conflict of interest cannot be
resolved by the consent of Indemnitor and Indemnified Party to the joint
representation, or (B) Indemnitor or Indemnified Party shall fail to give any
required consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
then such Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate counsel to
participate in the defense of such action on its behalf, at the reasonable
expense of the Indemnitor.

         (c)   If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of, or if after so
assuming, the Indemnitor fails to defend, any such claim, action or suit, then
the Indemnified Party may defend such claim, action or suit in such manner as
the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate (provided that the Indemnitor may
participate in such defense at its own expense), and the Indemnitor shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount of all fees and
expenses, legal and other, reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense and settlement of such claim, action or suit. If no
settlement of such claim, action or suit is made, the Indemnitor shall satisfy
any judgment rendered with respect to such claim, or in such action or suit,
before the Indemnified Party is required to do so, and pay all fees and
expenses, legal or other, reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in the
defense of such claim, action or suit.

         (d)   If a final and non-appealable decision or court order is rendered
against the Indemnified Party in any claim, action or suit covered by the
indemnification hereunder, or any Lien in respect of such decision or court
order attaches to any of the assets of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor
shall immediately upon such entry or attachment pay in full any amount required
by such decision or court order, or discharge such Lien, before the Indemnified
Party is compelled to do so.

         (b)   by either party (provided that such party is not otherwise in

or a USCC Material Adverse Effect (in the case of a breach by USCC), and the
breaching party fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written
notice thereof;

other party's filing, or the other party having filed against it and remaining
pending for more than thirty (30) days, a petition under Title 11 of the United
States Code or similar state law provision seeking protection from creditors or
the appointment of a trustee, receiver or debtor in possession;

         (d)   by either party upon written notice to the other party if a court
of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Transactions, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable; or

         (e)   by either party upon written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the first anniversary of the date
hereof.

         Section 9.2.     EFFECT OF TERMINATION

representations or warranties hereunder and (b) this Section 9.2 and the
provisions of Section 5.4 and Article 8 and Article 10 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

amend to make unobjectionable any portion that is the subject of any FCC action,
