                             AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE
                               EL PASO CORPORATION
                              STRATEGIC STOCK PLAN

      Pursuant to Section 14.1 of the El Paso Corporation Strategic Stock Plan,
Amended and Restated effective as of December 3, 1999, as amended (the "Plan"),
the Plan is hereby amended as follows, effective November 7, 2002:

      Section 4 is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
following:

            "To be eligible for selection by the Plan Administrator to
      participate in the Plan, an individual must be an officer or key
      management employee of the Company, or of any Subsidiary, as of the date
      on which the Plan Administrator grants to such individual an option,
      limited stock appreciation right, stock appreciation right or Restricted
      Stock or a person who, in the judgment of the Plan Administrator, holds a
      position of responsibility and is able to contribute substantially to the
      Company's continued success. Members of the Board of Directors of the
      Company who are full-time salaried officers shall be eligible to
      participate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may
      make a grant under this Plan to members of the Board of Directors who are
      not employees of the Company but contribute substantially to the Company's
      continued success and to individuals who are not officers or key
      management employees, provided that the effectiveness of such grant shall
      be conditioned upon such individual becoming an officer or key management
      employee of the Company or any Subsidiary. "Termination of employment," as
      it relates to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, who
      participate in the Plan, shall mean the cessation of a Director's
      continued service on the Board under the Plan."

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this amendment to be duly
executed on this 7th day of November, 2002.
