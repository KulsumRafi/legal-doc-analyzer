interest in the Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Participations owing to Merrill

interest and fees to and including the Effective Date) equal to its Pro Rata
Share of said outstanding obligations. In connection with said assignment and
purchase, on the Effective Date Banknorth shall pay to Merrill such amounts as
may be necessary such that after given effect to such payment, Merrill and
Banknorth shall be owed from the Borrowers outstanding Revolving Credit
Obligation equal to their respective Pro Rata Shares therein as of the Effective
Date.

required to provide any and all necessary disclosure pertaining to the
Additional Borrower so as to make said disclosure true and complete as to all of
the Borrowers after giving effect to the joinder of the Additional Borrowers to

         6. FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. Except as expressly modified by this
Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect, and all parties hereto shall be entitled to
the benefits thereof. This Amendment is limited as written and shall not be
deemed (i) to be an amendment of or a consent under or waiver of any other term
