                              INTERDEBTOR AGREEMENT

          THIS INTERDEBTOR AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
this 8th day of April 2002, by and between ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("ICN"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ribapharm Inc.
("Ribapharm").

                                    RECITALS

          WHEREAS, Pursuant to an Offering Memorandum dated July 13, 2001, ICN
sold in a private placement, $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount (and an
additional $125,000,000 aggregate principal amount to cover over-allotments) of
6 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Notes");

          WHEREAS, the Notes were issued and sold pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of July 13, 2001, among ICN,
Ribapharm, and UBS Warburg LLC (the "Initial Purchaser"), the Indenture (the
"Indenture"), dated as of July 18, 2001, among ICN, Ribapharm and The Bank of
New York, as trustee, and the Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration
Rights Agreement"), dated as of July 18, 2001 among ICN, Ribapharm, and the
Initial Purchaser;

          WHEREAS, Ribapharm has filed a registration statement to effect the
Ribapharm IPO (as defined in the Indenture);

          WHEREAS, ICN intends to distribute its remaining interest in Ribapharm
in the Ribapharm Spin-Off (as defined in the Indenture);

          WHEREAS, ICN and Ribapharm entered into a letter agreement, dated July
18, 2001 (the "Letter Agreement") to clarify their relationship with respect to
certain provisions of the Notes; and

          WHEREAS, each of ICN and Ribapharm believe that it is in their best
interest and in the best interest of their respective stockholders to amend and
restate the Letter Agreement in its entirety as set forth herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good
and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

          1.   Primary Obligor. While upon the earlier of a Ribapharm IPO or a
Ribapharm Spin-Off, Ribapharm will become a joint and several obligor of the
Notes, as between ICN and Ribapharm, ICN and Ribapharm agree that ICN shall be
responsible for all payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and any
other payments under the Notes, including

<PAGE>

Ribapharm's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change in
Control of Ribapharm or ICN. In the event Ribapharm makes any such payments
under the Notes for any reason, ICN shall promptly reimburse Ribapharm for these
payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ribapharm shall be responsible for the
payment of liquidated damages pursuant to Section 5 of the Registration Rights
Agreement caused by Ribapharm's failure to comply with its obligations to file
and maintain an effective Registration Statement.

          2.   Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any
respect except by a written agreement signed by both of the parties hereto and
in accordance with the following:

               a.   This Agreement may be amended or modified on behalf of ICN
                    by a written instrument signed by an authorized officer of
                    ICN.

               b.   (i) Any amendment or modification to this Agreement that
                    does not adversely affect the rights of Ribapharm may be
                    made by a written instrument signed by an authorized officer
                    of Ribapharm; and

                    (ii) any other amendment or modification of this Agreement
                    may be made by a written instrument signed by an authorized
                    officer of Ribapharm only after such amendment or
                    modification has been approved by the affirmative vote of at
                    least a majority of the then outstanding shares of common
                    stock of Ribapharm, par value $0.01 per share ("Ribapharm
                    Common Stock"), excluding any shares of Ribapharm Common
                    Stock then beneficially owned by ICN.

          3.   Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. It is hereby stipulated and
declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the
remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of
such which may be hereafter declared invalid, void or unenforceable.

          4.   Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except with respect to a merger of
either party with another person, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party.

          5.   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
