         2. GUARANTY. The Guarantor hereby, absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guaranties to the Purchasers the full and punctual payment when due
of all Obligations, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment,
declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise, and such guaranty is not
conditional or contingent upon pursuit by the Purchasers of any prior action or
proceeding for collection, or for any other remedies the Purchasers may have,
against the Company or any other Person.

         3. CONSENT. Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that the whole or any
part of the security now or hereafter held for any Obligation may be exchanged,
compromised, released or surrendered from time to time; that the time or place
of payment of any Obligation or of any security therefor may be exchanged or
extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or otherwise, and may be
renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part; that the Company and any other
obligor on the Obligations may be granted indulgences generally; that any of the
provisions of the Notes may be renewed, extended, modified, increased,
accelerated, compromised, refinanced or waived; that neither the insolvency,
bankruptcy and/or dissolution of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other
obligor on the Obligations, shall affect the obligations hereunder of the
Guarantor; that neither the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the
Obligations shall affect the obligations hereunder of the Guarantor; that no
claim need be asserted against any trustee in bankruptcy or receiver or other
representative in the event the Borrower, the Guarantor or any other obligor on
the Obligations is adjudicated bankrupt or becomes insolvent; and that any
property to the credit of the Borrower, the Guarantor or any other party liable
for payment of any of the Obligations or liable upon any security therefor may

               (e) Notice of disposition of any security for any Obligation; and

               (f) Any defense by reason of impairment of: (i) any security now
         or hereafter held for any Obligation; or (ii) recourse against any
         party liable for the payment of any Obligation.

         5. GUARANTY OF PAYMENT. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not
of collection. The Guarantor: (a) waives any claim to marshaling of assets; (b)
waives any right to require that an action be brought against Borrower or any
other Person prior to action against the Guarantor hereunder; and (c) waives any
right to require that resort be had to any security, as applicable, for the
Notes or any other Obligations guaranteed hereunder prior to action by any
Purchaser against the Guarantor hereunder. The Guarantor shall be released from
all liability hereunder only upon payment in full in cash of all the
Obligations.

         6. BINDING EFFECT. The provisions of this Guaranty shall be binding
upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the
benefit of the Purchasers and their respective successors and assigns; it being
understood that each Purchaser is free to assign its rights, benefits, duties
and obligations under this Guaranty without the consent of any other party, and
the Guarantor may not assign its rights, benefits, duties and obligations under
this Guaranty without the prior written consent of each of the Purchasers.

         7. RIGHT OF SET OFF. The Purchasers agree that to the extent that the
Guarantor has made payment hereunder of all or any portion of principal and
interest required under the Notes, the full amount of such payment shall be
deducted from amounts allocable and payable to the Purchasers pursuant to the
Notes.

         8. REINSTATEMENT. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect
and continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time payment or performance of the Obligations, or any part thereof, is,
pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be
restored or returned by any obligee of the Obligations or such part thereof,
whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as
though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any
payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the
Obligations shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and
deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored
or returned.

         9. SUBROGATION. After (and not before) all amounts payable under or in
respect of the Notes have been indefeasibly paid in cash, the Guarantor shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Purchasers to receive payments in respect of the
Notes, but only to the extent of amounts paid by the Guarantor pursuant to this
Guaranty.

         10. AMENDMENT. This Guaranty may not be modified or amended except by a
writing duly executed by the party to be charged.

WITH, AND ENFORCED UNDER, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO
AGREEMENTS OR INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO AND PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

         12. SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be invalid under
such laws, such provision shall be effective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without affecting the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Guaranty, which shall be binding and
enforceable to the fullest extent allowable by law.

         13. WAIVER. Waiver by any Purchaser of a breach of this Guaranty shall
not operate as a waiver of any subsequent breach thereof.

         14. SIGNATURES; COUNTERPARTS. Telefacsimile transmissions of any
executed original document and/or retransmission of any executed telefacsimile
transmission shall be deemed to be the same as the delivery of an executed
original. At the request of any party hereto, the other parties hereto shall
confirm telefacsimile transmissions by executing duplicate original documents
and delivering the same to the requesting party or parties. This Guaranty may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate
