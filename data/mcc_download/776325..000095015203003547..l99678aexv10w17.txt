      interest and fees shall be paid when collected from Borrowers. In the
      event that Agent elects to require any Bank to assign its interest to
      Agent or to the Designated Lender pursuant to this Section 11.10(C), Agent
      will so notify such Bank in writing within forty-five (45) days following
      such Bank's denial or deemed denial, and such Bank will assign its
      interest to Agent or the Designated Lender no later than five (5) days
      following receipt of such notice pursuant to an Assignment Agreement
      unless, in the case of a deemed denial, such Bank has actually consented
      to the subject request prior to such date, in which case such Bank shall
      not be required to assign its interest.

      15. The Credit and Security Agreement is hereby amended to insert a new
Section 5.25 and a new Section 5.26 thereto as follows:

            SECTION 5.25. BOLIVAR. Borrowers and Bolivar Development Center,
      Inc., a Missouri non-profit corporation ("Bolivar") covenant that Bolivar
      shall not have any business operations at any time and shall not hold any
      assets, including but not limited to, any Collateral; provided that,
      notwithstanding the foregoing, Bolivar may remain a party to that certain
      Management Agreement dated as of January 1, 1998 between Bolivar and
      Community Alternatives Missouri, Inc., a Delaware corporation and to
      continue to perform its obligations and responsibilities thereunder,
      including, but not limited to, the holding of licenses in connection
      therewith.

            SECTION 5.26. CITADEL. Borrowers and Citadel covenant that upon the
      consummation of the Citadel Disposition, Citadel shall commence a
      wind-down of its business affairs and shall use its best efforts to
      dissolve on or prior to December 31, 2003.

      16. The Credit and Security Agreement is hereby amended to delete Section
8.2 therefrom in its entirety and to insert in place thereof the following:


                                       8
<PAGE>

            SECTION 8.2. SPECIAL COVENANTS. If any Company or any Obligor shall
      fail or omit to perform and observe Sections 5.7, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13,
      5.19, 5.21, 5.22, 5.25 or 5.26 hereof.

      17. Schedule 1 to the Credit and Security Agreement is hereby amended to
delete Bolivar therefrom, and, upon the dissolution of Citadel pursuant to
Section 5.26 of the Credit and Security Agreement, to delete Citadel therefrom.
Upon the deletion of Bolivar and Citadel from Schedule 1 to the Credit and
Security Agreement, as the case may be, each of Bolivar and Citadel shall
thereby be released from any obligations as a Borrower under the Credit and
Security Agreement.

      18. Agent and the Banks agree to waive Borrowers' failure to comply with
(i) subparagraph (c) (EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) of Section 5.7
(Financial Covenants) of the Credit and Security Agreement for the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2002, (ii) Section 4.5 (Good Standing Certificates)
of the Credit and Security Agreement with respect to Bolivar's failure to
deliver a good standing certificate, and (iii) Section 5.5 (Franchises) of the
Credit and Security Agreement with respect to any past failure of Bolivar to
remain in good standing.

      19. As a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Second Amendment
Agreement, Borrowers shall:

            (a) pay to Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Banks, an
      amendment fee equal to One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);

            (b) pay all reasonable legal fees and expenses of Agent incurred in
      connection with this Second Amendment Agreement; and

            (c) deliver an officer's certificate of each Borrower certifying the
      names of the officers of such Borrower authorized to sign the Second
      Amendment Agreement, together with the true signatures of such officers
      and certified copies of the resolutions of each Borrower evidencing
      approval of the execution and delivery of this Second Amendment Agreement.

      20. Borrowers agree to use their best efforts deliver updated Schedules to
the Credit and Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents, if necessary,
prior to the effective date of this Second Amendment Agreement, and, in any
event, shall deliver such updated Schedules within thirty (30) days hereof.

      21. Each Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Agent and the Banks
that (a) such Borrower has the legal power and authority to execute and deliver
this Second Amendment Agreement; (b) the officers executing this Second
Amendment Agreement have been duly authorized to execute and deliver the same
and bind such Borrower with respect to the provisions hereof; (c) the execution
and delivery hereof by such Borrower and the performance and observance by such
Borrower of the provisions hereof do not violate or conflict with the
organizational agreements of such Borrower or any law applicable to such
Borrower or result in a breach of any provision of or constitute a default under
any other agreement, instrument or document binding upon or enforceable against
such Borrower; (d) no Default or Event of Default


                                       9
<PAGE>

exists, nor will any occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Second Amendment Agreement or by the performance or observance of any provision
hereof; (e) no Borrower is aware of any claim or offset against, or defense or
counterclaim to, any Borrower's obligations or liabilities under the Credit and
Security Agreement or any Related Writing; and (f) this Second Amendment
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Borrower in every
respect enforceable in accordance with its terms.

      22. In consideration of this Second Amendment Agreement, each Borrower
hereby waives and releases Agent and each Bank and their respective directors,
officers, employees, attorneys, affiliates and subsidiaries from any and all
such claims, offsets, defenses and counterclaims of which such Borrower is
aware, such waiver and release being with full knowledge and understanding of
the circumstances and effect thereof and after having consulted legal counsel
with respect thereto.

      23. Each reference that is made in the Credit and Security Agreement or
any other writing to the Credit and Security Agreement shall hereafter be
construed as a reference to the Credit and Security Agreement as amended hereby.
Except as herein otherwise specifically provided, all provisions of the Credit
and Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and be unaffected
hereby. This Second Amendment Agreement is a Related Writing as defined in the
Credit and Security Agreement.

      24. This Second Amendment Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, by different parties hereto in separate counterparts and by
facsimile signature, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but
one and the same agreement.

      25. The rights and obligations of all parties hereto shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to principles of conflicts of
laws.
