the other Party to the maximum extent possible with respect to the wording and
timing of any such disclosure. The Parties shall mutually agree on a press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement to be issued immediately
following the execution hereof. If either Party wishes to issue any further
press release regarding the Research Program, it shall furnish a copy to the
other Party, which shall review such press release and provide any comments

concerning the definitions of terms used in this Agreement, in an expedient
manner by mutual cooperation and without resort to litigation. To accomplish
this objective, the Parties agree to follow the procedures set forth in this
Section 9.1 to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. In the event of
such a dispute between the Parties, either Party, by written notice to the other
Party, shall have such dispute referred to the Parties' respective executive
officers designated below or their successors, for attempted resolution by good
faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after such notice is received. Said
designated officers are as follows:

            For IG:                  Chief Executive Officer

            For Access:              Vice President, Research & Development

In the event the designated executive officers are not able to resolve such
dispute after such thirty (30) day period, then the Parties shall resolve such
dispute by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA"). Three arbitrators shall be selected.

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.

      9.7 AMENDMENT; WAIVER. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded

waiving compliance, provided, that in the case of IG, such amendment must be
approved by a majority of the members of IG's Board of Directors who are not
selected by or affiliated with Access. The delay or failure of any Party at any
time or times to require performance of any provisions shall in no manner affect
the rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any
condition or of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement, whether by

Parties as agents for the other or as partners with each other or any Third

      9.9 ASSIGNMENT AND SUCCESSORS. This Agreement may not be assigned by
either Party without the written consent of the other which shall not be

rights, obligations and interests of such Party to any purchaser of all or
substantially all of its assets or to any successor corporation resulting from
any merger or consolidation of such Party with or into such corporation.

      9.10 FORCE MAJEURE. Neither IG nor Access shall be liable for failure of
or delay in performing obligations set forth in this Agreement, and neither
shall be deemed in breach of its obligations, if such failure or delay is due to
natural disasters or any causes beyond the reasonable control of IG or Access.
In event of such force majeure, the Party affected thereby shall use reasonable
efforts to cure or overcome the same and resume performance of its obligations
hereunder.

      9.11 INTERPRETATION. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (i)

this Agreement and have contributed to its revision; (ii) the rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved against the
drafting Party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement;
and (iii) the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed fairly
as to all Parties hereto and not in a favor of or against any Party, regardless
of which Party was generally responsible for the preparation of this Agreement.

Agreement, is the sole agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all other agreements and understandings between the Parties with
