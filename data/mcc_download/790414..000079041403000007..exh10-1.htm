</B><LI>Within ninety (90) days after the Conversion Date, or at such other time
as is mutually agreed to by the Parties, Buyer shall prepare according to the
directions contained in subsection (c) (with the assistance of Sellers with
respect to items under Sellers' control) and deliver to Sellers a Final Closing
Statement together with a tape or other mutually acceptable documentation
showing the changes to the Preliminary Closing Statement and each Subsequent
Closing Statement.  Sellers shall review such Final Closing Statement within
thirty (30) days and shall promptly notify Buyer of any discrepancies.  The
Parties shall confer until they are in agreement on the Final Closing Statement.
In the event the disputing Parties are unable to reach agreement on the Final
Closing Statement within ten (10) Business Days of the date Buyer has been
notified of any discrepancies by Sellers, with respect to the funds that are the
subject of dispute, the Parties shall jointly hire a nationally recognized
public accounting firm as the Parties mutually agree, to resolve any
discrepancies in the Final Closing Statement, and shall equally share the costs
of such resolution.  The accounting firm selected shall not at the time of
selection (or at any time during its engagement hereunder) be performing
services for the Buyer, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.  The
final resolution and decision issued by such accounting firm shall be binding
upon the Parties.  The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the work of the accounting firm to be completed and report thereof to
be furnished to the Parties within thirty (30) Business Days following the
appointment of the accounting firm.  The date when Sellers and Buyer reach
agreement on the Final Closing Statement or, in the absence of such agreement
the date when final resolution and decision is issued, is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Final Settlement Date."</LI>
<LI>If the Final Closing Statement establishes an increase in the Purchase Price
for the Account Portfolio Assets over that calculated based on the Preliminary
Closing Statement and each Subsequent Closing Statement, the amount of any such
increase shall be delivered to Gottschalks by Buyer within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Settlement Date.  If the Final Closing Statement
establishes a decrease in the Purchase Price over that calculated based on the
Preliminary Closing Statement and each Subsequent Closing Statement, Gottschalks
shall deliver to Buyer any deficiency within three (3) Business Days after the
Final Settlement Date.  Any payment made to any Party pursuant to this Section
3.4(b) shall include interest calculated on a daily basis from the Closing Date
applicable to the Account or Accounts which are the subject matter of the
reconciliation to the date such payment is made at the Federal Funds Interest
Rate.</LI>
<LI>If an Account that does not satisfy the definition of "Account" is included
in the Preliminary Closing Statement or a Subsequent Closing Statement, as the
case may be, as of the applicable Cut-Off Time, it shall be excluded from the
Final Closing Statement.  Such exclusion shall be effective retroactively as of
the applicable Cut-Off Time, and Buyer shall add to the Purchase Price reflected
on the Final Closing Statement the amount of any payment Buyer received from an
Account Debtor on such Account net of any amount previously credited to such
Accounts by Buyer which after the applicable Cut-Off Time was determined to be a
check for insufficient funds, stop-payments or any amount required to be
refunded by Buyer to or on behalf of any Account Debtor.  Within ten (10)
Business Days after Buyer and Gottschalks agree to the Final Closing Statement,
Buyer shall deliver to Gottschalks any assignment, acknowledgment, or other
document necessary to evidence Gottschalks' continuing right, title, and
interest in such Account. If an Account is not included in the Preliminary
Closing Statement or a Subsequent Closing Statement, as the case may be, but is
included in the Final Closing Statement because such Account satisfied the
definition of "Account" as of the applicable Cut-Off Time, such addition shall
be deemed to have occurred retroactively as of the applicable Cut-Off Time, and
Gottschalks shall subtract from the Purchase Price reflected on the Final
Closing Statement the amount of any payment Sellers received from an Account
Debtor on such Account on or after the applicable Cut-Off Time net of any amount
previously credited to the Account by Sellers which after the applicable Cut-Off
Time was determined to be a check for insufficient funds, stop-payments or any
amount required to be refunded by Sellers to or on behalf of any Account Debtor;
provided, however, that no subtraction shall be made from the Purchase Price for
any payments remitted by Sellers to Buyer.  Any addition or subtraction to
Purchase Price made by any Party pursuant to this Section 3.4(c) shall include
interest calculated on a daily basis from the Closing Date applicable to the
Account or Accounts which are the subject matter of the reconciliation to the
date such payment is made at the Federal Funds Interest Rate.</LI>
<LI>If Indebtedness arising from Cross-Marketing Merchandise is included in the
Preliminary Closing Statement or a Subsequent Closing Statement, as the case may
be, as of the applicable Cut-Off Time and such Indebtedness is subject to a bona
fide dispute by the Account Debtor at any time prior to the applicable Closing
Date, such Indebtedness shall be excluded from the Final Closing Statement.
Such exclusion shall be effective retroactively as of the applicable Cut-Off
Time, and Buyer shall add to the Purchase Price reflected on the Final Closing
Statement the amount of any payment Buyer received from an Account Debtor on
account of such Indebtedness, net of any amount previously credited to such
Indebtedness by Buyer which after the applicable Cut-Off Time was determined to
be a check for insufficient funds, stop-payments or any amount required to be
refunded by Buyer to or on behalf of any Account Debtor.  Within ten (10)
Business Days after Buyer and Gottschalks agree on the Final Closing Statement,
Buyer shall deliver to the Gottschalks any assignment, acknowledgment or other
document necessary to evidence Gottschalks' continuing right, title and interest
in such Indebtedness. Any addition made by Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.4(d)
shall include interest calculated on a daily basis from the Closing Date
applicable to the Indebtedness which is the subject matter of the reconciliation
to the date such payment is made at the Federal Funds Interest Rate.</LI></OL>

Assumption Agreement and the Bill of Sale in accordance with this Agreement and
the filing of the UCC-1 financing statement referred to in Section 5.1(d) are
sufficient to transfer GCRC's title to the Indebtedness in respect of any
Current Account to Buyer.  Upon such transfer, Buyer will be vested with all of
GCRC's right, title, and interest in and to the Indebtedness in respect of each
Current Account, free and clear of any lien, pledge, claim, security interest,
encumbrance, charge, or restriction of any kind existing on the Account
Portfolio Assets.</LI>
<B><LI>Processing.</B>  During the period of GCRC's ownership of the
Indebtedness in respect of each Current Account, such Indebtedness has been
processed and serviced in conformance with all of the requirements of the
respective Account Documentation and other applicable servicing agreements and
policies and applicable law and in accordance with GCRC's written policies.  All
such Indebtedness presently is, and during the period of GCRC's ownership of
such Indebtedness always has been, processed by GCRC or an Affiliate of GCRC or
third party contractor of GCRC.</LI>
<B><LI>Default.</B>  No default or potential default exists on the part of GCRC
with respect to the Indebtedness in respect of any Current Account, other than
those defaults or potential defaults which could not be reasonably expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Account Portfolio Assets or the
consolidated operations (financial or otherwise), business or prospects of the
Sellers taken as a whole.  </LI></OL>

<A NAME="_Toc31634397">Dispute Resolution.</A></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

</B><LI>All Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with this Section 9.8.
"Dispute" means any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, statute or other legal or
equitable theory (including without limitation, any claim of fraud,
misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement or any question of validity or effect
of this Agreement including this clause) or the breach or termination
thereof.</LI>
<LI>The Parties agree to communicate with each other to achieve informal
resolution of all Disputes that may arise under this Agreement.  However, if
such communication does not resolve such Dispute, the matter in dispute will be
subject to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in this Section 9.8.  The
Party that desires to initiate the dispute resolution shall notify the other
party in writing of the nature and details of the Dispute (the "Dispute
Notice").  Within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the Dispute
Notice, a face to face meeting of one or more principal officers of each party
shall be held at a mutually convenient time and location to negotiate a
resolution of the Dispute.  If negotiation does not resolve the matter, the
parties agree to submit the matter to mediation within forty (40) days from the
date of delivery of the Dispute Notice.  The mediation shall be administered in
accordance with American Arbitration Association's Commercial Mediation Rules.
The mediator will not have power to decide the Dispute, but will use mediation
techniques to assist the Parties in reaching a resolution.  The costs of such
mediation shall be shared equally 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Sellers.  If
the Dispute is not resolved by negotiation or mediation within fifty (50) days
of delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Parties agree to submit the matter in
dispute to binding arbitration which shall be conducted before JAMS/Endispute,
Inc. ("JAMS") in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS
as in effect at the time of the commencement of the arbitration.</LI>
<LI>The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator acceptable to the
Parties .  If the Parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then (i) the
Buyer shall choose one arbitrator and the Sellers shall choose one arbitrator
and (ii) a third arbitrator shall be chosen by the other two arbitrators;
provided, that each Arbitrator chosen under (i) and (ii) above shall not be an
Affiliate of any party to such arbitration (the "Arbitrator(s)").  The
Arbitrator(s) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  Any award made by
the Arbitrator(s) shall be binding on the parties.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, any Party at any time may require that a matter in dispute
be submitted directly to arbitration, irrespective of whether negotiation or
mediation has been attempted or completed.</LI>
<LI>Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York.</LI>
<LI>The Arbitrator shall have the authority, taking into account the Parties'
desire that any arbitration proceeding hereunder be reasonably expedited and
efficient, to permit the Parties to conduct discovery.  Any such discovery shall
be (i) guided generally by and be no broader than permitted under the United
States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and (ii) subject to the Arbitrator and
the Parties entering into a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement.</LI>
<LI>The Arbitrator's or Arbitrators' decision and award in any such arbitration
shall be made and delivered within 120 days of the date on which such
arbitration proceedings commenced.</LI>
<LI>The Arbitrator's or Arbitrators' decision shall be in writing and shall be
as brief as possible and will include the basis for the Arbitrator's decision.
A record of the arbitration proceeding shall be kept.</LI>
<LI>Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered into any
court having jurisdiction thereof.</LI>
<LI>The Arbitrator shall have the power but not the obligation to award to the
Party it deems to have prevailed, all or a portion of the costs of the
arbitration (including, transcripts, room rental fees and fees and expenses of
the arbitrator and JAMS, and the reasonable legal fees, costs and disbursements
of the prevailing Party thereto); provided, that if court proceedings to stay
litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the non-prevailing Party in such
proceedings shall pay all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney's fees
incurred in connection with such court proceedings.</LI>
<LI>The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Section 9.8 shall not
limit the right of any Party to seek from a court of competent jurisdiction any
equitable relief with respect to the Dispute to which such Party may otherwise
be entitled, including, without limitation, specific performance or injunctive
or other relief.</LI>
<LI>The Parties agree to participate in any arbitration in good faith.</LI></OL>
