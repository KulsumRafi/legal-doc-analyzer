with the provisions hereof, the issuance, sale and delivery of the Common Shares

a material breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a material default under, or result in the creation or imposition of
any material lien pursuant to the terms of, the Articles of Incorporation (the
"ARTICLES") or Bylaws of the Company or any statute, law, rule or regulation or
any state or federal order, judgment or decree or any indenture, mortgage, lease

in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents (the
"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto. The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and any
subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments or to the
extent that such unaudited statements do not include footnotes).

of, or registration, qualification, designation, declaration or filing with, any
federal, state, or local governmental authority on the part of the Company is
required in connection with the

the SEC Documents, since September 30, 2002, there have not been any changes in
the assets, liabilities, financial condition, business prospects or operations
of the Company from that reflected in the Financial Statements except changes in
the ordinary course of business which have not been, either individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse.

actions, suits proceedings or investigations pending or, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its properties
before or by any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official in which there is a reasonable likelihood (in the judgment of the
Company) of an adverse decision that (a) could have a material adverse effect on
the Company's properties or assets or the business of the Company as currently
conducted, or (b) could impair the ability of the Company to perform in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement.

Affiliates, nor any person or entity acting on its or their behalf has, directly
or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any Company security or solicited any

reliance by the Company on Section 4(2) for the exemption from registration for
the transactions contemplated hereby or would require registration of the

                                    ARTICLE 4

           REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASERS

      Each Purchaser hereby severally represents and warrants to the Company:

      4.1 AUTHORIZATION. Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that:
(a) Purchaser has all requisite legal and corporate or other power and capacity
and has taken all requisite corporate or other action to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to purchase the


                                       6.
<PAGE>
Common Shares and the Warrants to be purchased by it and to carry out and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement, and (b) this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) as limited by equitable
principles generally.

      4.2 INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. Purchaser is aware of the
Company's business affairs and financial condition and has had access to and has
acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and
knowledgeable decision to acquire the Common Shares and the Warrants. Purchaser
has such business and financial experience as is required to give it the
capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the purchase of the
Common Shares and Warrants.

      4.3 INVESTMENT INTENT. Purchaser is purchasing the Common Shares and the
Warrants for its own account as principal, for investment purposes only, and not
with a present view to, or for, resale, distribution or fractionalization
thereof, in whole or in part, within the meaning of the Securities Act, other
than as contemplated by Article 7. Purchaser understands that its acquisition of
the Common Shares and the Warrants has not been registered under the Securities
Act or registered or qualified under any state securities law in reliance on
specific exemptions therefrom, which exemptions may depend upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed
herein. Purchaser has completed or caused to be completed the Purchaser
Questionnaire attached hereto as EXHIBIT C for use in preparation of the
Registration Statement, and the responses provided therein shall be true and
correct as of the Closing Date and will be true and correct as of the effective
date of the Registration Statement. Purchaser, in connection with its decision
to purchase the Common Shares and the Warrants, has relied solely upon the SEC
Documents and the representations and warranties of the Company contained
herein. Purchaser will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, pledge,
transfer or otherwise dispose of (or solicit any offers to buy, purchase or
otherwise acquire or take a pledge of) any of the Securities except in
compliance with the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

      4.4 REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION REQUIREMENTS. Purchaser further acknowledges
and understands that the Securities may not be resold or otherwise transferred
except in a transaction registered under the Securities Act or unless an
exemption from such registration is available.

      4.5 DISPOSITIONS. Purchaser will not, prior to the Effectiveness Deadline
Date (as defined below) of the Registration Statement, if then prohibited by law
or regulation: (a) sell, offer to sell, solicit offers to buy, dispose of, loan,
pledge or grant any right with respect to (collectively, a "DISPOSITION") the
Securities; or (b) engage in any hedging or other transaction which is designed
or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Disposition of
Securities by such Purchaser or any person or entity. In addition, Purchaser
agrees that for so long as it owns any Shares, it will not enter into any short
sale of Shares executed at a time when the Purchaser has no equivalent
offsetting long position in the Common Stock. For purposes of determining
whether the Purchaser has an equivalent offsetting long position in the Shares,
shares that the Purchaser is entitled to receive within sixty (60) days (whether
pursuant to


                                       7.
<PAGE>
contract or upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities) will be
included as if held long by the Purchaser.

      4.6 NO LEGAL, TAX OR INVESTMENT ADVICE. Purchaser understands that nothing
in this Agreement or any other materials presented to Purchaser in connection
with the purchase and sale of the Common Shares and the Warrants constitutes
legal, tax or investment advice. Purchaser has consulted such legal, tax and
investment advisors as it, in its sole discretion, has deemed necessary or
appropriate in connection with its purchase of the Common Shares and the
Warrants.

      4.7 CONFIDENTIALITY. Purchaser will hold in confidence all information
concerning this Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder until
the earlier of such time as (a) the Company has made a public announcement
concerning the Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder, or (b)
this Agreement is terminated; provided, however, that the foregoing provision of
this Section 4.7 shall not apply if the Company does not issue a press release
concerning the Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder within
one (1) day of the date hereof.

      4.8 RESIDENCY. Purchaser's principal executive offices are in the
jurisdiction set forth immediately below Purchaser's name on the Schedule of
Purchasers attached hereto as EXHIBIT A.

      4.9 GOVERNMENTAL REVIEW. Purchaser understands that no United States
federal or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has
passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Shares or the
Warrants.

      4.10 LEGEND. Purchaser understands that, until such time as the
Registration Statement has been declared effective or the Securities may be sold
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold,
the Securities may bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form
(and a stop transfer order may be placed against transfer of the certificates
for the Shares):

                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
            REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE
            SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR IN ANY OTHER
            JURISDICTION. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
            SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
            STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS UNLESS
            OFFERED, SOLD OR TRANSFERRED PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM
            THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE LAWS."

      If Rule 144(k) is available to a Purchaser, the Company shall, upon a
Purchaser's written request and delivery of appropriate documents reasonably
requested by the Company, promptly


                                       8.
<PAGE>
cause certificates evidencing the Securities to be replaced with certificates
which do not bear such restrictive legends, and Warrant Shares subsequently
issued upon due exercise of the Warrants shall not bear such restrictive legends
provided Rule 144(k) is available with respect to such Warrant Shares.

      4.11 FOREIGN INVESTORS. If Purchaser is not a United States person (as
defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended), Purchaser hereby represents that it has satisfied itself as to the
full observance of the laws of its jurisdiction in connection with any
invitation to subscribe for the Common Shares and the Warrants or any use of
this Agreement, including (a) the legal requirements within its jurisdiction for
the purchase of the Common Shares and the Warrants, (b) any foreign exchange
restrictions applicable to such purchase or acquisition, (c) any government or
other consents that may need to be obtained, and (d) the income tax and other
tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the purchase, holding,
redemption, sale or transfer of the Securities. Purchaser's subscription and
payment for and continued beneficial ownership of the Securities will not
violate any applicable securities or other laws of Purchaser's jurisdiction.

Date; provided, however, that in the event that a Registration Statement is

                                      11.
<PAGE>

            (d) furnish to each Purchaser (and to each underwriter, if any, of

to service of process in any jurisdiction;

            (f) advise each Purchaser promptly:

post-effective amendments thereto;

                  (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments to the

Registrable Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation
of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes; and

                  (iv) of the existence of any fact and the happening of any
event that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration
Statement, the prospectus and amendment or supplement thereto, or any document
incorporated by reference therein, untrue, or that requires the making of any
additions to or changes in the Registration Statement or the prospectus in order
to make the statements therein not misleading;

            (g) use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Shares to be
listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which equity securities by the
Company are then listed;

            (h) bear all expenses in connection with the procedures in
paragraphs (a) through (g) of this Section 7.2 and the registration of the

<PAGE>
            (i) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to make available
to its security holders no later than the Availability Date (as defined below),
an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve (12) months,
beginning after the effective date of each Registration Statement, which
earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act, including Rule 158 promulgated thereunder (for the purpose of
this subsection 3(i), "Availability Date" means the 45th day following the end
of the fourth fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter that includes the
effective date of such Registration Statement, except that, if such fourth
fiscal quarter is the last quarter of the Company's fiscal year, "Availability
Date" means the 90th day after the end of such fourth fiscal quarter).

      7.3 DELAY IN EFFECTIVENESS. If the Registration Statement is not declared
effective by the SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Deadline Date, then for
each thirty (30) day period following the Effectiveness Deadline Date, until but
excluding the date the Registration Statement is declared effective, the Company
shall, for such period, pay each Purchaser, as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, an amount equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the purchase
price of the Common Shares purchased by such Purchaser hereunder, for such
period (or prorated for any partial period); and for any such period, such
payment shall be made no later than the first business day of the calendar month
next succeeding the last month in which such period occurs. The parties hereto
agree that the liquidated damages provided for in this Section 7.3 constitute a
reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by the Purchasers by
reason of the failure of the Registration Statement to be declared effective in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

      7.4 INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Purchaser, the partners, members, officers and directors of each Purchaser and
each person, if any, who controls such Purchaser within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to which they may become subject (under the Securities Act or
otherwise) insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading or arise out of any failure by the Company to fulfill any undertaking
included in the Registration Statement and the Company will, as incurred,
reimburse such Purchaser, partner, member, officer, director or controlling
person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating,
defending or preparing to defend any such action, proceeding or claim; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that such loss, claim, damage or liability (collectively, "LOSS") arises out of,
or is based upon, an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission made in such Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such
Purchaser, partner, member, officer, director or controlling person specifically
for use in preparation of the Registration Statement or any breach of this
Agreement by such Purchaser; and provided further, however, that the Company
shall not be liable to any Purchaser of Registrable Shares (or any partner,
member, officer, director or controlling person of such Purchaser) to the extent
that any such Loss is caused by an untrue statement or omission or


                                      13.
<PAGE>
alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus if
either (i)(A) such Purchaser failed to send or deliver a copy of the final
prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by
such Purchaser to the person asserting the claim from which such Loss resulted
and (B) the final prospectus corrected such untrue statement or omission, (ii)
(X) such untrue statement or omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement
to the prospectus and (Y) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of
the Company with copies of the prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such
Purchaser thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or
supplemented, with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale
of a Registrable Share to the person asserting the claim from which such Loss
resulted or (iii) such Purchaser sold Registrable Shares in violation of such
Purchaser's covenant contained in Section 7.5 of this Agreement.

            (b) Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company (and each person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement
and each director of the Company), from and against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to which the Company (or any such officer, director or
controlling person) may become subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise),
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any breach of
this Agreement by such Purchaser or any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in each case, on the
effective date thereof, if, and to the extent, such untrue statement or omission
or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such Purchaser
specifically for use in preparation of the Registration Statement, and such
Purchaser will reimburse the Company (and each of its officers, directors or
controlling persons) for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action, proceeding or
claim; provided, however, that in no event shall any indemnity under this
Section 7.4(b) be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net
of the amount of any damages such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission) received by such Purchaser upon the sale of the Registrable Securities
included in the Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

            (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified person of a notice of
a claim or the beginning of any action in respect of which indemnity is to be
sought against an indemnifying person pursuant to this Section 7.4, such
indemnified person shall notify the indemnifying person in writing of such claim
or of the commencement of such action, and, subject to the provisions
hereinafter stated, in case any such action shall be brought against an
indemnified person and such indemnifying person shall have been notified
thereof, such indemnifying person shall be entitled to participate therein, and,
to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person. After notice from the
indemnifying person to such indemnified person of its election to assume the
defense thereof, such indemnifying person shall not be liable to such
indemnified person for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified person in connection with the


                                      14.
<PAGE>
defense thereof; provided, however, that if there exists or shall exist a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment
of the indemnified person for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified
person and such indemnifying person or any affiliate or associate thereof, the
indemnified person shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the expense of
such indemnifying person; provided, further, that no indemnifying person shall
be responsible for the fees and expense of more than one separate counsel for
all indemnified parties. The indemnifying party shall not settle an action
without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

            (d) If after proper notice of a claim or the commencement of any
action against the indemnified party, the indemnifying party does not choose to
participate, then the indemnified party shall assume the defense thereof and
upon written notice by the indemnified party requesting advance payment of a
stated amount for its reasonable defense costs and expenses, the indemnifying
party shall advance payment for such reasonable defense costs and expenses (the
"ADVANCE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT") to the indemnified party. In the event that
the indemnified party's actual defense costs and expenses exceed the amount of
the Advance Indemnification Payment, then upon written request by the
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party
for such difference; in the event that the Advance Indemnification Payment
exceeds the indemnified party's actual costs and expenses, the indemnified party
shall promptly remit payment of such difference to the indemnifying party.

            (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.4 is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party
with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein,
the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss,
claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified
party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations;
provided, that in no event shall any contribution by an indemnifying party
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of
the amount of any damages such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement
or omission) received by such indemnifying party upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement giving rise to
such indemnification obligation..

      7.5 PROSPECTUS DELIVERY. Each Purchaser hereby covenants with the Company
not to make any sale of the Registrable Shares without complying with Section
8.3. The Purchaser acknowledges that there may be times when the Company must
suspend the use of the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement
until such time as an amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed by
the Company and declared effective by the SEC, or until such time as the Company
has filed an appropriate report with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. The
Purchaser hereby covenants that it will not sell any Registrable Shares pursuant
to said prospectus during the period commencing at the time at which the Company
gives the Purchaser notice of the suspension of the use of said prospectus and
ending at the time the Company gives the Purchaser notice that the Purchaser may
thereafter effect sales pursuant to said prospectus; provided that such
suspension periods shall in no event exceed thirty (30) days in any twelve (12)
month period and that, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of


                                      15.
<PAGE>
Directors, the Company would, in the absence of such delay or suspension
hereunder, be required under state or federal securities laws to disclose any
corporate development, a potentially significant transaction or event involving
the Company, or any negotiations, discussions, or proposals directly relating
thereto, in either case the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect upon the Company or its shareholders.

      7.6 TERMINATION OF OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the Company pursuant to
Section 7.2 hereof shall cease and terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a)
such time as all of the Registrable Shares have been resold, (b) such time as
all of the Registrable Shares may be resold in a three-month period pursuant to
Rule 144, or (c) the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

      7.7 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

            (a) With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules
and regulations of the SEC that may at any time permit the sale of the
Securities to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-3, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to:

                  (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms
are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

                  (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act; and

                  (iii) so long as any of the Purchasers own Registrable Shares,
to furnish to such Purchaser upon request (A) a written statement by the Company
as to whether it is in compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144,
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, or whether it is qualified as a
registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to SEC Form S-3, and (B) a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other
reports and documents so filed by the Company.

      7.8 SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Company shall use best efforts to call, give
notice of and hold, no later than 30 days after the date hereof, a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the approval of the authorization
and issuance of the Common Shares and the Warrants and the issuance of the
Warrant Shares upon exercise of or otherwise pursuant to the Warrants in
compliance with Rule 4350(i) of the Marketplace Rules of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL"), to the
extent required by the Nasdaq National Market. The term "Shareholder Approval"
shall specifically include a determination by the Nasdaq National Market that
approval of the holders of Company Common Stock is not required for the
authorization and issuance of the Common Shares and the Warrants and the
issuance of the Warrants Shares upon exercise of or otherwise pursuant to the
Warrants.

      7.9 BLUE SKY. The Company shall obtain and maintain all necessary blue sky
law permits and qualifications, or secured exemptions therefrom, required by any
state for the offer and sale of Securities.

Declaration of Trust of each Purchaser that is a fund or series investment
company (each, a "Fund") organized as a Massachusetts business trust (each, a
"Trust") is on file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The

notice that the rights and obligations of each series of shares of a Trust under
its Agreement and Declaration of Trust are separate and distinct from those of
any and all other series.

                         COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES ACT

      8.1 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY. The Securities shall not be

sale of the Securities except:

                  (i) in accordance with the Registration Statement, in which
case Purchaser covenants to comply with the requirement of delivering a current
prospectus; or

                  (ii) in accordance with Rule 144, in which case Purchaser
covenants to comply with Rule 144; or

                  (iii) (A) If the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement, (B) such Purchaser shall have notified the
Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a
detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition,
and (C) if reasonably requested by the Company, such Purchaser shall have
furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, that such disposition will not require registration of such shares
under the Securities Act.


                                      17.
<PAGE>
            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, no such

limited liability company transferring to its members or former members in

individual transferring to the Purchaser's family member or trust for the
benefit of an individual Purchaser; provided that in each case the transferee
will agree in writing to be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same
extent as if he were an original Purchaser hereunder.

            (c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, if a Purchaser
is selling the Securities using the prospectus forming a part of the
Registration Statement, such Securities are not transferable on the books of the
Company unless the certificate submitted to the Company's transfer agent
evidencing such Securities is accompanied by a separate certificate executed by
an officer of, or other person duly authorized by, the Purchaser in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT F.

      8.4 PURCHASER INFORMATION. Each Purchaser covenants that it will promptly
notify the Company of any changes in the information set forth in the

      9.1 TERMINATION.

            (a) This Agreement may be terminated and the sale and purchase of
the Common Shares and the Warrants abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

                  (i) by written agreement of (A) the Company and (B) Purchasers
purchasing a majority of the Common Shares;

                  (ii) if the SEC has determined not to review the proxy
statement filed with the SEC by the Company in connection with obtaining the
Shareholder Approval (the "PROXY STATEMENT"), by written notice of any
individual Purchaser if the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained within 30
days of the date hereof (other than as a result of the failure on the part of
the party giving such notice of termination to perform its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement in all material respects); provided, however
that the abandonment of the sale and purchase of the Common Shares and the
Warrants shall be applicable only to such Purchaser providing such written
notice;

                  (iii) if the Proxy Statement is reviewed by the SEC, by
written notice of any individual Purchaser if the Shareholder Approval has not
been obtained within 45 days of the date hereof (other than as a result of the
failure on the part of the party giving such notice of termination to perform
its covenants and obligations under this Agreement in all material respects);
provided, however that the abandonment of the sale and purchase of the Common


                                      18.
<PAGE>
Shares and the Warrants shall be applicable only to such Purchaser providing
such written notice;

                  (iv) by written notice of any individual Purchaser if (i)
there is a material breach of any representation or warranty of the Company,
provided written notice of such breach has been given to the Company and the
Company has not cured such breach within 30 days of such notice, or (ii) the
Purchaser reasonably determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Article 5 has become impossible (other than as a result of any
failure on the part of the Purchaser to comply with or perform its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement);

                  (v) by written notice of the Company if (i) there is a
material breach of any representation or warranty of any Purchaser, provided
written notice of such breach has been given to such Purchaser and the Purchaser
has not cured such breach within 30 days of such notice or (ii) the Company
reasonably determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article 6 has become impossible (other than as a result of any failure on the
part of the Company to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation set
forth in this Agreement); provided, however, that the abandonment of the sale
and purchase of the Common Shares and the Warrants pursuant to clause (i) of
this paragraph shall be applicable only with respect to such Purchaser to whom
the material breach applies; or

                  (vi) by written notice of the Company if Purchasers purchasing
seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the Common Shares have terminated this
Agreement.

            (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9.1 all
further obligations of the parties shall terminate; provided, however, that (i)
no party shall be relieved of any liability arising from any breach by such
party of any provision of this Agreement and (ii) the parties shall, in all
events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions set forth
in this Article 9.

amended and any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon the Company and
all holders of Registrable Shares.

                                 FORM OF WARRANT

THIS WARRANT AND THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT AS TO SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

                               ARADIGM CORPORATION

                        WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

                                                            ______________, 2003

                         VOID AFTER _____________, 2007

      THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, ___________________________, with
its principal office at __________________________, or assigns (the "Holder"),
is entitled to subscribe for and purchase at the Exercise Price (defined below)
from Aradigm Corporation, a California corporation, with its principal office at
3929 Point Eden Way, Hayward, CA 94545 (the "Company") up to
____________________ (_____) shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the
"Common Stock").

      1. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following terms shall have the
following respective meanings:

            (a) "Exercise Period" shall mean the period commencing with the date
hereof and ending four (4) years from the date hereof, unless sooner terminated
as provided below.

            (b) "Exercise Price" shall mean $1.07 per share, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5 below.

            (c) "Exercise Shares" shall mean the shares of the Company's Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

      2. EXERCISE OF WARRANT. The rights represented by this Warrant may be
exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Exercise Period, by
delivery of the following to the Company at its address set forth above (or at
such other address as it may designate by notice in writing to the Holder):

            (a) An executed Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto;

            (b) Payment of the Exercise Price either (i) in cash or by check,
(ii) by cancellation of indebtedness, or (iii) pursuant to Section 2.1 below;
and


                                       1.
<PAGE>
            (c) This Warrant.

      Upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate
or certificates for the Exercise Shares so purchased, registered in the name of
the Holder or persons affiliated with the Holder, if the Holder so designates,
shall be issued and delivered to the Holder within a reasonable time after the
rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised.

      The person in whose name any certificate or certificates for Exercise
Shares are to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have
become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which this Warrant was
surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date
of delivery of such certificate or certificates, except that, if the date of
such surrender and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the
Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of
such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the
stock transfer books are open.

      2.1 NET EXERCISE. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary,
if the fair market value of one share of the Company's Common Stock is greater
than the Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu
of exercising this Warrant by payment of cash, the Holder may elect to receive
shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion
thereof being canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of
the Company together with the properly endorsed Notice of Exercise in which
event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of shares of Common Stock
computed using the following formula:

                           X = Y (A-B)
                               -------
                                   A

         Where    X =      the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to
                           the Holder

                  Y =      the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable
                           under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the
                           Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the
                           Warrant being canceled (at the date of such
                           calculation)

                  A =      the fair market value of one share of the Company's
                           Common Stock (at the date of such calculation)

                  B =      Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such
                           calculation)

      For purposes of the above calculation, the "fair market value" of one
share of Common Stock shall mean (i) the average of the closing sales prices for
the shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market or other trading market
where such security is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets (or a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by
the Company and reasonably acceptable to the holders if Bloomberg Financial
Markets is not then reporting sales prices of such security) (collectively,
"Bloomberg") for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding
such date, or (ii) if the Nasdaq National Market is not the principal trading
market for the shares of Common Stock, the average of the reported sales prices
reported by Bloomberg on the principal trading market for the Common Stock
during the same period, or, if there is no sales price for such period, the last
sales


                                       2.
<PAGE>
price reported by Bloomberg for such period, or (iii) if neither of the
foregoing applies, the last sales price of such security in the over-the-counter
market on the pink sheets or bulletin board for such security as reported by
Bloomberg, or if no sales price is so reported for such security, the last bid
price of such security as reported by Bloomberg, or (iv) if fair market value
cannot be calculated as of such date on any of the foregoing bases, the fair
market value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in
the exercise of its good faith judgment.

      3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.

      3.1 COVENANTS AS TO EXERCISE SHARES. The Company covenants and agrees that
all Exercise Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all taxes, liens and
charges with respect to the issuance thereof. The Company further covenants and
agrees that the Company will at all times during the Exercise Period, have
authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of
shares of its Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented
by this Warrant. If at any time during the Exercise Period the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to permit
exercise of this Warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purposes.

      NO IMPAIRMENT. Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the
Holder, the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the exercise rights of the Holder against impairment.

      NOTICES OF RECORD DATE. In the event of any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash
dividend which is the same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other
distribution, the Company shall mail to the Holder, at least ten (10) days prior
to the date specified herein, a notice specifying the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.

      4. REPRESENTATIONS OF HOLDER.

      ACQUISITION OF WARRANT FOR PERSONAL ACCOUNT. The Holder represents and
warrants that it is acquiring the Warrant solely for its account for investment
and not with a view to or for sale or distribution of said Warrant or any part
thereof. The Holder also represents that the entire legal and beneficial
interests of the Warrant and Exercise Shares the Holder is acquiring is being
acquired for, and will be held for, its account only.

      SECURITIES ARE NOT REGISTERED.

            (a) The Holder understands that the Warrant and the Exercise Shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act") on the basis that no


                                       3.
<PAGE>
distribution or public offering of the stock of the Company is to be effected.
The Holder realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be present if,
notwithstanding its representations, the Holder has a present intention of
acquiring the securities for a fixed or determinable period in the future,
selling (in connection with a distribution or otherwise), granting any
participation in, or otherwise distributing the securities. The Holder has no
such present intention except as set forth in Article 7 of the Securities
Purchase Agreement dated as of February 10, 2003 by and among the Company and
the purchasers name therein (the "Securities Purchase Agreement").

            (b) The Holder recognizes that the Warrant and the Exercise Shares
must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Act
or an exemption from such registration is available. The Holder recognizes that
the Company will register the Exercise Shares pursuant to the provisions of
Section 7 of the Securities Purchase Agreement.

            (c) The Holder is aware that neither the Warrant nor the Exercise
Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 adopted under the Act unless certain
conditions are met, including, among other things, the existence of a public
market for the shares, the availability of certain current public information
about the Company, the resale following the required holding period under Rule
144 and the number of shares being sold during any three month period not
exceeding specified limitations.

      DISPOSITION OF WARRANT AND EXERCISE SHARES.

            (d) The Holder further agrees not to make any disposition of all or
any part of the Warrant or Exercise Shares in any event unless and until:

                  The Company shall have received a letter secured by the Holder
from the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that no action will be
recommended to the Commission with respect to the proposed disposition; or

                  There is then in effect a registration statement under the Act
covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance
with said registration statement; or

                  The Holder shall have notified the Company of the proposed
disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed statement of
the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and if reasonably
requested by the Company, the Holder shall have furnished the Company with an
opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the Holder to
the effect that such disposition will not require registration of such Warrant
or Exercise Shares under the Act or any applicable state securities laws.

            (e) The Holder understands and agrees that all certificates
evidencing the shares to be issued to the Holder may bear the following legend:

      "THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
      1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE,
      PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
      STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL


                                       4.
<PAGE>
      SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED."

      5. ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE AND SHARES.

            (a) In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the
Company by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations,
reclassifications, combinations or exchanges of shares, separations,
reorganizations, liquidations, consolidation, acquisition of the Company
(whether through merger or acquisition of substantially all the assets or stock
of the Company), or the like, the number and class of shares available under the
Warrant in the aggregate and the Exercise Price shall be correspondingly
adjusted to give the Holder of the Warrant, on exercise for the same aggregate
Exercise Price, the total number, class, and kind of shares or other property as
the Holder would have owned had the Warrant been exercised prior to the event
and had the Holder continued to hold such shares until the event requiring
adjustment. The form of this Warrant need not be changed because of any
adjustment in the number of Exercise Shares subject to this Warrant.

            (b) If at any time or from time to time the holders of Common Stock
of the Company (or any shares of stock or other securities at the time
receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall have received or become
entitled to receive, without payment therefor,

                  (i) Common Stock or any shares of stock or other securities
which are at any time directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock, or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other distribution
(other than a dividend or distribution covered in section 5(a) above),

                  (ii) any cash paid or payable otherwise than as a cash
dividend, or

                  (iii) Common Stock or additional stock or other securities or
property (including cash) by way of spinoff, split-up, reclassification,
combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement (other than shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(a) above),

then and in each such case, the Holder hereof will, upon the exercise of this
Warrant, be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional consideration
therefor, the amount of stock and other securities and property (including cash
in the cases referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above) which such Holder
would hold on the date of such exercise had he been the holder of record of such
Common Stock as of the date on which holders of Common Stock received or became
entitled to receive such shares or all other additional stock and other
securities and property.

      6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
exercise of this Warrant as a consequence of any adjustment pursuant hereto. All
Exercise Shares (including fractions) issuable upon exercise of this Warrant may
be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the exercise would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after aggregation, the exercise would
result in the issuance of a fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of
issuance of any fractional share, pay the Holder otherwise entitled to such
fraction a sum in cash


                                       5.
<PAGE>
equal to the product resulting from multiplying the then current fair market
value of an Exercise Share by such fraction.

      7. NO SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. This Warrant in and of itself shall not entitle
the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the Company.
8. TRANSFER OF WARRANT. Subject to applicable laws and the restriction on
transfer set forth on the first page of this Warrant, this Warrant and all
rights hereunder are transferable, by the Holder in person or by duly authorized
attorney, upon delivery of this Warrant and the form of assignment attached
hereto to any transferee designated by Holder. The transferee shall sign an
investment letter in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.

      9. LOST, STOLEN, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED WARRANT. If this Warrant is lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Company may, on such terms as to indemnity
or otherwise as it may reasonably impose (which shall, in the case of a
mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like
denomination and tenor as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed.
Any such new Warrant shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the
Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

      10. NOTICES, ETC. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery to the
party to be notified, (b) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent
during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on the next business
day, (c) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (d) one (1) day after deposit with
a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
written verification of receipt. All communications shall be sent to the Company
at the address listed on the signature page and to Holder at ___________________
or at such other address as the Company or Holder may designate by ten (10) days

disposition of all or any part of the aforesaid shares of Common Stock unless
and until
<PAGE>
there is then in effect a registration statement under the Securities
Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in
accordance with said registration statement, or the undersigned has provided the
Company with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, stating that
such registration is not required.

A.    GENERAL INFORMATION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.    SECURITIES HOLDINGS

      Please fill in all blanks in the following questions related to your
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP of the Company's capital stock. Generally, the term
"BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP" refers to any direct or indirect interest in the
securities which entitles you to any of the rights or benefits of ownership,
even though you may not be the holder of record of the securities. For example,
securities held in "street name" over which you exercise voting or investment
power would be considered BENEFICIALLY OWNED by you. Other examples of indirect
ownership include ownership by a partnership in which you are a partner or by an
estate or trust of which you or any member of your IMMEDIATE FAMILY is a
beneficiary. Ownership of securities held in the names of your spouse, minor
children or other relatives who live in the same household may be attributed to
you.

================================================================================
      PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY INTEREST IN
SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY WHICH YOU MAY HAVE, HOWEVER REMOTE, IS A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST, PLEASE DESCRIBE SUCH INTEREST. FOR PURPOSES OF RESPONDING TO THIS
QUESTIONNAIRE, IT IS PREFERABLE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION RATHER THAN
EXCLUSION. WHERE THE SEC'S INTERPRETATION OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP WOULD REQUIRE
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INTEREST OR POSSIBLE INTEREST IN CERTAIN SECURITIES OF THE
COMPANY, AND YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY POSSESS THE ATTRIBUTES OF
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP, AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS TO DISCLOSE THE INTEREST AND AT
THE SAME TIME DISCLAIM BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF THE SECURITIES.

or cause the direction of the management or policies of the other entity in
question.

      (3) The NASD defines a "person associated with a member" or an "associated
person of a member" as being every sole proprietor, partner, equity owner,
officer, director or branch manager of any member, or any natural person
occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any natural
person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who directly or
indirectly controls or is controlled by such member (for example, any employee),

husband or wife, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, son-in-law

                           OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL

March ___, 2003

TO THE PURCHASERS LISTED
ON EXHIBIT A HERETO

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      We have acted as counsel for Aradigm Corporation, a California corporation
(the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale pursuant to the terms
of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of February ____, 2003 (the
"Agreement"), by and among the Company and the purchasers named therein (each, a
"Purchaser" and collectively, the "Purchasers"), of an aggregate of ___________
shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Shares") and warrants to
purchase an aggregate of up to _________ shares of the Company's common stock
(the "Warrants") and the cancellation and reissuance, pursuant to the terms of
the Warrant Repricing Agreement dated as of February ___, 2003 (the "Repricing
Agreement"), by and among the Company and certain Purchasers, of Common Stock
Warrants (as reissued, the "New Common Warrants") held by certain Purchasers and
issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Preferred Agreement")
dated December 11, 2001 by and among the Company and certain persons listed on
the Schedule of Purchasers attached to the Preferred Agreement as Exhibit A. We
are rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Agreement. Except as
otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings given to them in the Agreement.

      In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the
representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in and made
pursuant to the Agreement by the various parties and originals or copies
certified to our satisfaction, of such records, documents, certificates,
opinions, memoranda and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or
appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below. As to certain
factual matters, we have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and
have not independently sought to verify such matters. Where we render an opinion
"to the best of our knowledge" or concerning an item "known to us" or our
opinion otherwise refers to our knowledge, it is based solely upon (i) an
inquiry of attorneys within this firm who perform legal services for the
Company, (ii) receipt of a certificate executed by an officer of the Company
covering such matters, and (iii) such other investigation, if any, that we
specifically set forth herein.

      In rendering this opinion, we have assumed: the genuineness and
authenticity of all signatures on original documents; the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals; the conformity to originals of all
documents submitted to us as copies; the accuracy, completeness and authenticity
of certificates of public officials; and the due authorization, execution and
delivery of all documents (except the due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Company of the Agreement, the Warrants, the Repricing Agreement and the
New Common
<PAGE>
Warrants (collectively, the "Transaction Documents")), where authorization,
execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness of such documents.
We have also assumed: that all individuals executing and delivering documents
had the legal capacity to so execute and deliver; that you have received all
documents you were to receive under the Transaction Documents; that the
Transaction Documents are obligations binding upon the parties thereto other
than the Company; if you or any Purchasers are a corporation or other entity,
that such entities have filed any required California franchise or income tax
returns and have paid any required California franchise or income taxes; and
that there are no extrinsic agreements or understandings among the parties to
the Transaction Documents that would modify or interpret the terms of the
Transaction Documents or the respective rights or obligations of the parties
thereunder.

      Our opinion is expressed only with respect to the federal laws of the
United States of America and the laws of the State of California. We express no
opinion as to whether the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply, and no
opinion to the extent that the laws of any jurisdiction other than those
identified above are applicable to the subject matter hereof. We are not
rendering any opinion as to compliance with any antifraud law, rule or
regulation relating to securities, or to the sale or issuance thereof.

      With regard to our opinion in paragraph 2 below with respect to the
Company's obligation to qualify to do business in various states, we have relied
solely on a certificate of an officer of the Company regarding the states in
which the Company owns or leases property or has employees or other
representatives with authority to bind it to contracts; we have made no further
investigation.

      With regard to our opinion in paragraph 6 below, we express no opinion
with respect to any required consents, approvals, authorizations, orders,
filings, registrations and qualifications under any antitrust laws, rules or
regulations of the United States.

      On the basis of the foregoing, in reliance thereon and with the foregoing
qualifications, we are of the opinion that:

1.    The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing
      corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of California.

2.    The Company has the requisite corporate power to enter into and perform
      its obligations under the Transaction Documents. The Company has the
      requisite corporate power to own its properties and assets and to conduct
      its business as, to the best of our knowledge, it is currently being
      conducted, and, to the best of our knowledge, is not required to qualify
      as a foreign corporation to do business in any other jurisdiction in the
      United States.

3.    The Transaction Documents have been duly and validly authorized, executed
      and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and binding agreements
      of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their
      respective terms, except as rights to indemnity under Section 7.4 of the
      Agreement may be limited by applicable laws and except as enforcement may
      be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
<PAGE>
      reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
      creditors' rights, and subject to general equity principles and to
      limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific
      performance.

4.    The Common Shares, the Warrants and the New Common Warrants have been duly
      authorized, and upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor in
      accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the Common Shares, the
      Warrants and the New Common Warrants will be duly authorized and validly
      issued and the Common Shares will be fully paid and nonassessable. The
      shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and the New
      Common Warrants have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance, and
      upon issuance and delivery upon exercise of the Warrants and the New
      Common Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrants and the New
      Common Warrants, respectively, will be validly issued, fully paid and
      nonassessable.

5.    The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Company and
      the offer, issuance and sale of the Common Shares and the Warrants and the
      cancellation and reissuance of the New Common Warrants pursuant to the
      Agreement and the Reprising Agreement do not violate or contravene (a) any
      governmental statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or (b)
      any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award
      which has been entered against the Company and of which we are aware, the
      violation or contravention of which would materially and adversely affect
      the Company, its assets, financial condition or operations.

6.    All consents, approvals, authorizations or orders of, and filings,
      registrations and qualifications with any regulatory authority or
      governmental body in the United States required for the issuance of the
      Common Shares and the Warrants and the cancellation and reissuance of the
      New Common Warrants have been made or obtained, except (a) for the filing
      of the "Notification Form: Change in Number of Shares Outstanding" with
      the Nasdaq National Market, (b) for the filing of the notice to be filed
      under California Corporations Code Section 25102.1(d), (c) for the filing
      of a Form D pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation D
      and (d) other Blue Sky filings.

7.    The offer and sale of the Common Shares and the Warrants and the
      cancellation and reissuance of the New Common Warrants are exempt from the
      registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
      subject to the timely filing of a Form D pursuant to Securities and
      Exchange Commission Regulation D..

      This opinion is intended solely for your benefit and is not to be made
available to or be relied upon by any other person, firm, or entity without our
prior written consent; except that each Purchaser may rely on this opinion as if
it were addressed and delivered to such Purchaser on the date hereof.

such person shall not offer in any such action or proceeding the claim or
defense that such remedy at law exists.

      3.3 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement, and the rights of the parties hereto,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California as such laws apply to agreements among California residents made and

any such party.

      3.5 SEVERABILITY. In the event one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had
never been contained herein.

      3.6 TRANSFERS TO AFFILIATES. In the event a Shareholder transfers any of
its Shareholder Shares to an affiliate of such Shareholder, such Shareholder
shall cause such affiliate to do all things and execute and deliver all

agreement, substantially in the form of this Agreement, pursuant to which such
person becomes a party to this Agreement and agrees to be bound by all the

Agreement any shares or other securities are issued on, or in exchange for, any

counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, the Company, the Holders and certain other investors listed on

Securities Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), of even date herewith,
pursuant to which the Company has agreed to sell and issue and the Investors

      WHEREAS, at the Closing (as defined below), as a material inducement to
the Holders to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company desires to issue
and each Holder desires to acquire the New Common Warrants (as defined herein),
in exchange for and upon cancellation of Common Stock Warrants ("COMMON
WARRANTS") held by the Holders and issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Agreement (the "PREFERRED AGREEMENT") dated December 11, 2001 by and among the
Company and certain persons listed on the Schedule of Purchasers attached to the
Preferred Agreement as Exhibit A, and the Company desires to assumer certain
other obligations with respect to the Holders, all upon the terms and conditions
stated in this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
promises, representations, warranties and covenants hereinafter set forth and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                         ISSUANCE OF NEW COMMON WARRANTS

conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to cancel and reissue the
Common Warrants held by the Holders, such that the exercise price per share of
the Common Warrants shall be $1.12 and Section 2.1 of each Common Warrant,
providing for net issue exercise, shall be amended such that it is available in
certain limited circumstances, in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B (the
reissued Common Warrants referred to herein as the "NEW COMMON WARRANTS") and
each Holder agrees to cancel and surrender to the Company its Common Warrants.
The
<PAGE>
New Common Warrants and the shares of Common Stock of the Company ("COMMON
STOCK") issuable upon exercise of the New Common Warrants (the "SHARES") are
collectively referred to herein as the "SECURITIES."

                                   ARTICLE 2

                             CLOSING DATE; DELIVERY

      2.1 CLOSING DATE. Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the
conditions thereto set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the issuance of the New
Common Warrants (the "CLOSING") shall occur on the Closing Date as defined in
the Purchase Agreement.

      2.2 DELIVERY. At the Closing, the Company will deliver a duly executed New
Common Warrant to each Holder entitled to receive a New Common Warrant pursuant
to Section 1.1 of this Agreement, upon delivery to the Company by such Holder of
the Common Warrant held by such Holder.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      The Company represents and warrants to the Holders:

      3.1 CORPORATE POWER; AUTHORIZATION. The Company has all requisite legal
and corporate power and has taken all requisite corporate action to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to issue the New Common Warrants and to carry out and
perform all of its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes,
and upon execution and delivery by the Company of the New Common Warrants, the
New Common Warrants will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except (a) as
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b)
as limited by equitable principles generally. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the performance of this Agreement, the compliance with
the provisions hereof and the issuance of the New Common Warrants by the Company
will not materially conflict with, or result in a material breach or violation
of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a material default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material lien pursuant to
the terms of, the Articles of Incorporation (the "ARTICLES") or Bylaws of the
Company or any statute, law, rule or regulation or any state or federal order,
judgment or decree or any indenture, mortgage, lease or other material agreement
or instrument to which the Company or any of its properties is subject.

      3.2 ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY OF THE NEW COMMON WARRANTS. Upon exercise of the
New Common Warrants in accordance with the terms thereof, the Shares will be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The issuance and delivery of the
New Common Warrants is not subject to preemptive or any other similar rights of
the shareholders of the Company or any liens or encumbrances.
<PAGE>
                                   ARTICLE 4

            REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE HOLDERS

      Each Holder hereby severally represents and warrants to the Company:

      4.1 AUTHORIZATION. Holder represents and warrants to the Company that: (a)
Holder has all requisite legal and corporate or other power and capacity and has
taken all requisite corporate or other action to execute and deliver this
Agreement, and to carry out and perform all of its obligations under this
Agreement; and (b) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Holder, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i)
as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar laws
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii)
as limited by equitable principles generally.

      4.2 INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Holder is an "accredited investor" as defined
in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. Holder is aware of the Company's
business affairs and financial condition and has had access to and has acquired
sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable
decision to acquire the New Common Warrants. Holder has such business and
financial experience as is required to give it the capacity to protect its own
interests in connection with the acquisition of the New Common Warrants.

      4.3 INVESTMENT INTENT. Holder is acquiring the New Common Warrants for its
own account as principal, for investment purposes only, and not with a present
view to, or for, resale, distribution or fractionalization thereof, in whole or
in part, within the meaning of the Securities Act, other than as contemplated by
Article 7 hereof. Holder understands that its acquisition of the New Common
Warrants has not been registered under the Securities Act or registered or
qualified under any state securities law in reliance on specific exemptions
therefrom, which exemptions may depend upon, among other things, the bona fide
nature of Holder's investment intent as expressed herein. Holder has completed
or caused to be completed the Holder Questionnaire attached to the Purchase
Agreement as Exhibit D for use in preparation of the Registration Statement, and
the responses provided therein shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date
and will be true and correct as of the effective date of the Registration
Statement. Holder has, in connection with its decision to acquire the New Common
Warrants, relied solely upon the SEC Documents and the representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein and in the Purchase Agreement. Holder
will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise
dispose of (or solicit any offers to buy, purchase or otherwise acquire or take
a pledge of) any of the Securities except in compliance with the Securities Act,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

      4.4 REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION REQUIREMENTS. Holder further acknowledges
and understands that the Securities may not be resold or otherwise transferred
except in a transaction registered under the Securities Act or unless an
exemption from such registration is available.

      4.5 DISPOSITIONS. Holder will not, prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, if then prohibited by law or regulation, sell, offer to
sell, solicit offers to buy, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any right with
respect to (collectively, a "DISPOSITION") the Securities, nor will such Holder
engage in any hedging or other transaction which is designed or could
<PAGE>
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Disposition of Securities by
such Holder or any person or entity. In addition, the Holder agrees that for so
long as it owns any Shares, it will not enter into any Short Sales. For such
purposes, a "Short Sale" by the Holder means a short sale of Shares executed at
a time when the Holder has no equivalent offsetting long position in the Common
Stock. For purposes of determining whether the Holder has an equivalent
offsetting long position in the Shares, shares that the Holder is entitled to
receive within sixty (60) days (whether pursuant to contract or upon conversion
or exercise of convertible securities) will be included as if held long by the
Holder.

      4.6 NO LEGAL, TAX OR INVESTMENT ADVICE. Holder understands that nothing in
this Agreement or any other materials presented to Holder in connection with the
acquisition of the New Common Warrants constitutes legal, tax or investment
advice. Holder has consulted such legal, tax and investment advisors as it, in
its sole discretion, has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with its
acquisition of the New Common Warrants.

      4.7 CONFIDENTIALITY. Holder will hold in confidence all information
concerning this Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder until
the earlier of such time as (a) the Company has made a public announcement
concerning the Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder, or (b)
this Agreement is terminated; provided, however, that the foregoing provision of
this Section 4.7 shall not apply if the Company does not issue a press release
concerning the Agreement and the placement of the Securities hereunder within
two (2) days of the Closing.

      4.8 RESIDENCY. Holder's principal executive officers are in the
jurisdiction set forth immediately below Holder's name of the signature pages
hereto.

      4.9 GOVERNMENTAL REVIEW. Holder understands that no United States federal
or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has passed upon
or made any recommendation or endorsement of the New Common Warrants.

      4.10 LEGEND. Holder understands that, until such time as the Registration
Statement has been declared effective or the Securities may be sold pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act without any restriction as to the number of
securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, the
Securities may bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form
(and a stop transfer order may be placed against transfer of the certificates
for the Shares):

                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
            REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE
            SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR IN ANY OTHER
            JURISDICTION. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
            SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
            STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS UNLESS
            OFFERED, SOLD OR TRANSFERRED PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
<PAGE>
            EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE LAWS."

      4.11 FOREIGN INVESTORS. If Holder is not a United States person (as
defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended), Holder hereby represents that it has satisfied itself as to the full
observance of the laws of its jurisdiction in connection with any invitation to
acquire the New Common Warrants or any use of this Agreement, including (a) the
legal requirements within its jurisdiction for the acquisition of the New Common
Warrants, (b) any foreign exchange restrictions applicable to such acquisition,
(c) any government or other consents that may need to be obtained, and (d) the
income tax and other tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the
purchase, holding, redemption, sale or transfer of the Securities. Holder's
acquisition and continued beneficial ownership of the Securities will not
violate any applicable securities or other laws of Holder's jurisdiction.

                                   ARTICLE 5

                  CONDITIONS TO CLOSING OBLIGATIONS OF HOLDERS

      Each Holder's obligation to acquire the New Common Warrants at the Closing
is, at the option of such Holder, subject to the fulfillment or waiver as of the
Closing Date of the following conditions:

      5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations made by the
Company in Article 3 hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects
when made, and shall be true and correct in all material respects on the Closing
Date with the same force and effect as if they had been made on and as of such
date.

      5.2 COVENANTS. All covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed
by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date shall have been performed or
complied with in all material respects and the sale and issuance of the Common

Holders in Article 4 hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects

                                   ARTICLE 7

                                   COVENANTS

Agreement);

            (b) with respect to the Holders, to the extent the obligations of

                           FORM OF NEW COMMON WARRANT

THIS WARRANT AND THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT AS TO SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

                               ARADIGM CORPORATION

                        WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

                                                             _____________, 2003

                          VOID AFTER DECEMBER 14, 2006

      THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, ___________________________, with
its principal office at __________________________, or assigns (the "Holder"),
is entitled to subscribe for and purchase at the Exercise Price (defined below)
from Aradigm Corporation, a California corporation, with its principal office at
3929 Point Eden Way, Hayward, CA 94545 (the "Company") up to
____________________ (_____) shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the
"Common Stock").

      1. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following terms shall have the
following respective meanings:

            (a) "Exercise Period" shall mean the period commencing with the date
of this Warrant and ending on December 14, 2006, unless sooner terminated as
provided below.

            (b) "Exercise Price" shall mean $1.12 per share, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5 below.

            (c) "Exercise Shares" shall mean the shares of the Company's Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

      2. EXERCISE OF WARRANT. The rights represented by this Warrant may be
exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Exercise Period, by
delivery of the following to the Company at its address set forth above (or at
such other address as it may designate by notice in writing to the Holder):

            (a) An executed Notice of Exercise in the form attached hereto;

            (b) Payment of the Exercise Price either (i) in cash or by check, or
(ii) by cancellation of indebtedness; and
<PAGE>
            (c) This Warrant.

      Upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate
or certificates for the Exercise Shares so purchased, registered in the name of
the Holder or persons affiliated with the Holder, if the Holder so designates,
shall be issued and delivered to the Holder within a reasonable time after the
rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised.

      The person in whose name any certificate or certificates for Exercise
Shares are to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have
become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which this Warrant was
surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date
of delivery of such certificate or certificates, except that, if the date of
such surrender and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the
Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of
such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the
stock transfer books are open.

      2.1 NET EXERCISE. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary,
after the date on which a Registration Statement (as defined in Section 7.1 of
the Securities Purchase Agreement dated February 10, 2003, by and among the
Company and the persons listed on the Schedule of Purchasers attached thereto as
Exhibit A) has first gone effective, if (i) at any time a Registration Statement
is no longer effective and (ii) the fair market value of one share of the
Company's Common Stock is greater than the Exercise Price (at the date of
calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising this Warrant by payment
of cash, the Holder may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as
determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by
surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with
the properly endorsed Notice of Exercise in which event the Company shall issue
to the Holder a number of shares of Common Stock computed using the following
formula:

                           X = Y (A-B)
                               -------
                                  A

         Where    X =     the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to
                          the Holder

                  Y =     the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under
                          the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is
                          being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being
                          canceled (at the date of such calculation)

                  A =     the fair market value of one share of the Company's
                          Common Stock (at the date of such calculation)

                  B =     Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such
                          calculation)

      For purposes of the above calculation, the "fair market value" of one
share of Common Stock shall mean (i) the average of the closing sales prices for
the shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market or other trading market
where such security is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets (or a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by
the Company and reasonably acceptable to the holders if Bloomberg Financial
Markets is not then reporting sales prices of such security) (collectively,
"Bloomberg") for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding
such date, or (ii) if the Nasdaq
<PAGE>
National Market is not the principal trading market for the shares of Common
Stock, the average of the reported sales prices reported by Bloomberg on the
principal trading market for the Common Stock during the same period, or, if
there is no sales price for such period, the last sales price reported by
Bloomberg for such period, or (iii) if neither of the foregoing applies, the
last sales price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the pink
sheets or bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg, or if no
sales price is so reported for such security, the last bid price of such
security as reported by Bloomberg, or (iv) if fair market value cannot be
calculated as of such date on any of the foregoing bases, the fair market value
shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in the exercise
of its good faith judgment.

      3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.

      3.1 COVENANTS AS TO EXERCISE SHARES. The Company covenants and agrees that
all Exercise Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all taxes, liens and
charges with respect to the issuance thereof. The Company further covenants and
agrees that the Company will at all times during the Exercise Period, have
authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of
shares of its Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented
by this Warrant. If at any time during the Exercise Period the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to permit
exercise of this Warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purposes.

      NO IMPAIRMENT. Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the
Holder, the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger,
dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the
taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect
the exercise rights of the Holder against impairment.

      NOTICES OF RECORD DATE. In the event of any taking by the Company of a
record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash
dividend which is the same as cash dividends paid in previous quarters) or other
distribution, the Company shall mail to the Holder, at least ten (10) days prior
to the date specified herein, a notice specifying the date on which any such
record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend or distribution.

      4. REPRESENTATIONS OF HOLDER.

      ACQUISITION OF WARRANT FOR PERSONAL ACCOUNT. The Holder represents and
warrants that it is acquiring the Warrant solely for its account for investment
and not with a view to or for sale or distribution of said Warrant or any part
thereof. The Holder also represents that the entire legal and beneficial
interests of the Warrant and Exercise Shares the Holder is acquiring is being
acquired for, and will be held for, its account only.
<PAGE>
      SECURITIES ARE NOT REGISTERED.

            (a) The Holder understands that the Warrant and the Exercise Shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act") on the basis that no distribution or public offering of the stock of the
Company is to be effected. The Holder realizes that the basis for the exemption
may not be present if, notwithstanding its representations, the Holder has a
present intention of acquiring the securities for a fixed or determinable period
in the future, selling (in connection with a distribution or otherwise),
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the securities. The
Holder has no such present intention.

            (b) The Holder recognizes that the Warrant and the Exercise Shares
must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Act
or an exemption from such registration is available. The Holder recognizes that
the Company will register the Exercise Shares pursuant to the provisions of
Section 7 of that certain Warrant Repricing Agreement dated February ___, 2003.

            (c) The Holder is aware that neither the Warrant nor the Exercise
Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 adopted under the Act unless certain
conditions are met, including, among other things, the existence of a public
market for the shares, the availability of certain current public information
about the Company, the resale following the required holding period under Rule
144 and the number of shares being sold during any three month period not
exceeding specified limitations.

      DISPOSITION OF WARRANT AND EXERCISE SHARES.

            (d) The Holder further agrees not to make any disposition of all or
any part of the Warrant or Exercise Shares in any event unless and until:

                  The Company shall have received a letter secured by the Holder
from the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that no action will be
recommended to the Commission with respect to the proposed disposition; or

                  There is then in effect a registration statement under the Act
covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance
with said registration statement; or

                  The Holder shall have notified the Company of the proposed
disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed statement of
the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and if reasonably
requested by the Company, the Holder shall have furnished the Company with an
opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the Holder to
the effect that such disposition will not require registration of such Warrant
or Exercise Shares under the Act or any applicable state securities laws.

            (e) The Holder understands and agrees that all certificates
evidencing the shares to be issued to the Holder may bear the following legend:

      "THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
      1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). THEY MAY
<PAGE>
      NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF
      AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR
      AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION
      IS NOT REQUIRED."

      5. ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE.

            (a) In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the
Company by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations,
reclassifications, combinations or exchanges of shares, separations,
reorganizations, liquidations, or the like, the number and class of shares
available under the Warrant in the aggregate and the Exercise Price shall be
correspondingly adjusted to give the Holder of the Warrant, on exercise for the
same aggregate Exercise Price, the total number, class, and kind of shares as
the Holder would have owned had the Warrant been exercised prior to the event
and had the Holder continued to hold such shares until after the event requiring
adjustment. The form of this Warrant need not be changed because of any
adjustment in the number of Exercise Shares subject to this Warrant.

            (b) If at any time or from time to time the holders of Common Stock
of the Company (or any shares of stock or other securities at the time
receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall have received or become
entitled to receive, without payment therefor,

                  (i) Common Stock or any shares of stock or other securities
which are at any time directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable
for Common Stock, or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or
otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other distribution
(other than a dividend or distribution covered in section 5(a) above),

                  (ii) any cash paid or payable otherwise than as a cash
dividend, or

                  (iii) Common Stock or additional stock or other securities or
property (including cash) by way of spinoff, split-up, reclassification,
combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement (other than shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(a) above),

then and in each such case, the Holder hereof will, upon the exercise of this
Warrant, be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of shares of Common
Stock receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional consideration
therefor, the amount of stock and other securities and property (including cash
in the cases referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above) which such Holder
would hold on the date of such exercise had he been the holder of record of such
Common Stock as of the date on which holders of Common Stock received or became
entitled to receive such shares or all other additional stock and other
securities and property.

      6. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the
exercise of this Warrant as a consequence of any adjustment pursuant hereto. All
Exercise Shares (including fractions) issuable upon exercise of this Warrant may
be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the exercise would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after aggregation, the exercise would
result in the issuance of a fractional share, the Company shall, in lieu of
<PAGE>
issuance of any fractional share, pay the Holder otherwise entitled to such
fraction a sum in cash equal to the product resulting from multiplying the then
current fair market value of an Exercise Share by such fraction.

      7. NO SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. This Warrant in and of itself shall not entitle
the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the Company.

      8. TRANSFER OF WARRANT. Subject to applicable laws and the restriction on
transfer set forth on the first page of this Warrant, this Warrant and all
rights hereunder are transferable, by the Holder in person or by duly authorized
attorney, upon delivery of this Warrant and the form of assignment attached
hereto to any transferee designated by Holder. The transferee shall sign an
investment letter in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.

      9. LOST, STOLEN, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED WARRANT. If this Warrant is lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Company may, on such terms as to indemnity
or otherwise as it may reasonably impose (which shall, in the case of a
mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like
denomination and tenor as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed.
Any such new Warrant shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the
Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

      10. NOTICES, ETC. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (a) upon personal delivery to the
party to be notified, (b) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent
during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on the next business
day, (c) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (d) one (1) day after deposit with
a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
written verification of receipt. All communications shall be sent to the Company
at the address listed on the signature page and to Holder at ___________________
or at such other address as the Company or Holder may designate by ten (10) days
advance written notice to the other parties hereto.

      11. ACCEPTANCE. Receipt of this Warrant by the Holder shall constitute
acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions contained herein.

      12. GOVERNING LAW. This Warrant and all rights, obligations and
liabilities hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.
