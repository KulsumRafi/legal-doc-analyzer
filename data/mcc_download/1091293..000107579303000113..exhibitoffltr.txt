Dear  Sirs:

Re:     PARAGON  POLARIS  STRATEGIES.COM,  INC.  (the  "Corporation")
     -    Offer  to  Acquire [ No Shares ] Shares of  Icoworks  Inc.,  a  Nevada
          corporation ("Icoworks") pursuant to Regulation S of the United States
          Securities  Act  of  1933  (the  "Act")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We  write  to  set  forth  the  offer of the Corporation (the "Offer") to you to
purchase [ IcoShares ] ( [ NoShares ] ) shares of the common stock  of  Icoworks
that are  registered  in  your  name  (the  "Icoworks  Shares").

The  Corporation is making concurrent offers to certain non-U.S. shareholders of
Icoworks  owning in total approximately 54% of the issued and outstanding shares
of Icoworks (together, the "Concurrent Offers"). The Corporation is making these
Concurrent  Offers  pursuant  to  the  exemptions  from  the  prospectus  and
registration  requirements  provided by Regulation S of the Act and the Canadian
provincial  securities statutes of British Columbia and Alberta.   If Concurrent
Offers  are  accepted  by  shareholders  of  Icoworks  holding a majority of the
outstanding  shares of Icoworks, then the Corporation will own a majority of the
issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  Icoworks

This  Offer  is  on the terms and is subject to the conditions set forth in this
letter.  If  this  Offer  is  acceptable,  we  ask that you accept this Offer by
following  the  instructions in Section 5 of this letter. This Offer is open for
acceptance  until  5:00  p.m.  (Pacific  Time) on February 14, 2003 (the "Expiry
Time"),  at  which  time  this  offer will terminate unless extended in writing.
This  Offer  will  lapse  if  not  accepted  by  you  by  the  Expiry  Time.

The  Offer is on the following terms and is subject to the following conditions:

1.         Offer  to  Purchase
           -------------------

The  Corporation  offers  to purchase from you all of your Icoworks Shares.  The
Offer  is  subject  to  acceptance  by  shareholders of Icoworks representing in
aggregate  not  less  than  50% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of
Icoworks  pursuant  to  this  Offer  and  the  Concurrent  Offers  (the "Minimum
Acceptance Requirement"). Upon acceptance by you and satisfaction of the Minimum
Acceptance  Requirement,  this  Offer  will  become a firm and binding agreement
between  the  Corporation  and  you  for the sale of your Icoworks Shares to the
Corporation.  The  closing of the purchase and sale of your Icoworks Shares (the
"Closing") will take place on February 17, 2003, or such earlier date as elected
by  the  Corporation  if  the  Minimum  Acceptance  Requirement  is met prior to
February  17,  2003.

The  Corporation will issue to you two shares of common stock of the Corporation
(each  a  "Corporation  Share"  and  together,  the  "Corporation  Shares")  in
consideration  for each Icoworks Share that you own on closing. Accordingly, you
will  receive  [  PPSIShares  ] ( [ NoPPSIShares ] ) shares of the Corporation's

as  a  condition  of  the  Corporation  issuing  the  Corporation Shares to you:

     (1)  You  will  resell  the  Corporation Shares only in accordance with the
          provisions  of Regulation S of the Act, pursuant to registration under

          compliance  period  prescribed  by  Regulation  S  of  the  Act;

     (3)  The  Corporation  will  refuse  to  register  any  transfer  of  the
          Corporation  Shares  not  made  in  accordance  with the provisions of

          pursuant  to  an  available  exemption  from  registration;

          Corporation  Shares  unless  in  compliance  with  the  Act.

Shares  are  "restricted  securities"  under  the  Act and that all certificates
representing  the  Corporation Shares will be endorsed with the following legend
in  accordance  with  Regulation  S  of  the  Act:
