sufficiency of which are hereby mutually acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Landlord and Tenant hereby agrees as follows:

         $3,600,000. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has provided information
         to Tenant, which is satisfactory to Tenant, documenting the Aggregate

agreements and provisions thereof remain in full force and effect and are hereby
