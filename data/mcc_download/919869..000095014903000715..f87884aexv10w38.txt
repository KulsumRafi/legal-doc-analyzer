                  TERMINATION PERIOD.

                  Following termination of the Non-Employee Director's service
on the Board, the former Non-Employee Director (or the former Non-Employee
Director's estate, personal representative or beneficiary, as the case may be)
shall have the right, subject to the other terms and conditions of the Plan, to
exercise all portions of this Option that had vested as of or in connection with
the termination of service at any time within sixty (60) days after the date of
termination of service, subject to earlier expiration of the Option pursuant to
Section 8(a) of the Plan.

                                 II.                                   AGREEMENT

                  1.       GRANT OF OPTION. The Committee hereby grants to the
Non-Employee Director an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares
set forth above at the exercise price per share set forth above (the "Exercise
Price"), (i) subject to and conditional upon shareholder approval at the next
annual meeting of shareholders of the Company of the Amendment, and (ii) subject
to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by
reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the terms and
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

                  2.       EXERCISE OF OPTION.

                           (a)      RIGHT TO EXERCISE. This Option is
exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth
above and the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. In
the event of Non-Employee Director's death, disability or other termination of
Non-Employee Director, the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option
Agreement govern the exercisability of the Option.

                           This Option shall not be exercisable unless the
Common Shares subject hereto has been registered under the Securities Act, and
qualified under applicable state or foreign securities or "blue sky" laws in
connection with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has determined that
an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and from qualification
under such securities or "blue sky" laws is available. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Date, the Company shall register the issuance of the shares
of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Option, and shall, as required
by the Securities Act, maintain from time to time the effectiveness of such
registration.

                           (b)      METHOD OF EXERCISE. This Option is
exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice, in the form attached as Exhibit A
(the "Exercise Notice"), which shall state the election to exercise the Option,
the number of Optioned Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised
(the "Exercised Shares"), and such other representations and agreements as may
be required by the Company

                                                                        - E135 -

pursuant to the provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that no fewer than 10
shares of Common Shares may be purchased upon any exercise of this Option unless
the number of shares purchased at such time is the total number of shares in
respect of which the Option is then exercisable, and provided, further, that in
no event shall the Option be exercisable for a fractional share. The Exercise
Notice shall be signed by the Non-Employee Director and shall be delivered in
person or by a recognized overnight delivery service to the Secretary of the
Company at c/o Cronos Capital Corp., One Front Street, Suite 1500, San
Francisco, California 94111, or such other address as the Company shall
designate in a written notice to the Non-Employee Director. The Exercise Notice
shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all
Exercised Shares. The date of exercise of this Option shall be the later of (i)
the date on which the Company receives such written notice, or (ii) the date on
which the conditions provided in Sections 8(d) and 8(e) of the Plan are
satisfied.

                           No Exercised Shares shall be issued pursuant to the
exercise of this Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with all
relevant provisions of law and the requirements of any stock exchange or market
upon or in which the Exercised Shares are then listed and traded. Assuming such
compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered
transferred to the Non-Employee Director on the date the Option is exercised
with respect to such Exercised Shares.

                  3.       METHOD OF PAYMENT. Payment of the aggregate Exercise
Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the
election of the Non-Employee Director:

                           (a)      Cash or cash equivalent;

                           (b)      Previously owned shares;

                           (c)      Any combination of the above; or

                           (d)      Such other means as the Committee may
                                    approve.

                  4.       NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. This Option may not be
transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of except by will or the
laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order,
provided, however, that this Option may be transferred to a member or members of
a Non-Employee Director's immediate family (as defined below) or to one or more
trusts or partnerships or other entity established in whole or in part for the
benefit of one or more of such immediate family members (collectively,
"Permitted Transferees"), subject to the terms of the Plan and such rules and
procedures as may from time to time be adopted or imposed by the Committee.

                  If this Option is transferred to a Permitted Transferee, it
shall be further transferable only by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or, for no consideration, to another Permitted Transferee of the
Non-Employee Director. A Non-Employee Director shall notify the Company in
writing prior to any

                                                                        - E136 -

Company, upon request, with information concerning such Permitted Transferee's
financial condition and investment experience. For purposes of the Plan and this
Option Agreement, a Non-Employee Director's "immediate family" means any child,
stepchild, grandchild, spouse, son-in-law or daughter-in-law and shall include
adoptive relationships; provided, however, that if the Company adopts a
different definition of "immediate family" (or similar term) in connection with
the transferability of employee stock options awarded to employees of the
Company, such definition shall apply, without further action of the Board, to
the Plan or this Option Agreement.

                  The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be
binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the
Non-Employee Director.

                  5.       TERM OF OPTION. This Option may be exercised only
within the term set forth above, and may be exercised during such term only in
accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option Agreement.

                  6.       TAX CONSEQUENCES. Non-Employee Director hereby
acknowledges that Non-Employee Director has: (i) received and read the Company's
Proxy Statement dated December 5, 2000, including the summary of the tax
consequences of the grant and exercise of this Option, and (ii) been advised to
consult his or her tax adviser before exercising this Option or disposing of the
Exercised Shares.

                  7.       ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

                  (a)      The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The
Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all
prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and the Non-Employee Director
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to
the Non-Employee Director's interest except by means of a writing signed by the
Company and Non-Employee Director.

and final all decisions or interpretations of the

                                                                        - E137 -

meeting of shareholders of the Company of the Amendment. The Non-Employee

Amendment is not approved by the shareholders at the next annual meeting of
shareholders of the Company, this Option and this Option Agreement shall be null
and void immediately and automatically and without any action by either the
Non-Employee Director or the Company and shall have no further force or effect.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Non-Employee Director
have executed this Agreement as of the Date of Grant specified above.
