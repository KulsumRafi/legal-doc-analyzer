<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options may be granted only to employees and Eligible Non-Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Incentive Options may be granted only to employees. Any employee of the Company or of a Subsidiary shall be eligible to receive one or more Incentive Options, provided at the time such Incentive Option is granted, he does not own stock (including stock the ownership of which is attributed to him pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) possessing more than 10 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or a Subsidiary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1 <I>Amount of Stock.</I>  There may be issued under the Plan an aggregate of not more than 23,600,000 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.2. Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares or reacquired Shares, or both. In the event that Options shall terminate or expire without being exercised in whole or in part, new Options may be granted covering the Shares not purchased under such lapsed Options. No individual Optionee may receive in any calendar year Options with respect to more than 10% of the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the Plan.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE 6</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Terms and Conditions of Options</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 <I>Terms of Options.</I>  An Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve. Each Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Article 6 and shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Committee may deem desirable, but in no event shall such terms and conditions be inconsistent with the Plan. In addition, the terms and conditions of Incentive Options shall in all cases be consistent with the provisions of the Code applicable to "incentive stock options" as described in Section 422 of the Code.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2 <I>Option Price.</I>  The purchase price per Share under an Option will be determined by the Committee in its discretion, provided, however, that the purchase price per Share under an Option may not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share at the date the Option is granted. Except as provided in Section 5.2 the exercise price of an Option, once granted, may not be reduced nor may any Option be repriced either by repricing or cancellation and reissuance without the approval of the shareholders of the Company.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3 <I>Option Period.</I>  The period during which an Option may be exercised shall be fixed by the Committee, but no Incentive Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date such Incentive Option is granted and no Nonqualified Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years and one day from the date such Nonqualified Option is granted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.4 <I>Consideration.</I>  As consideration for the grant of an Option, each Optionee who is an employee shall state, in writing, his present intention to remain employed with the Company or a Subsidiary continuously for at least one year from the date the Option is granted. No Option shall be exercisable until after the expiration of such one-year period. Except as provided in Section 6.7, an option to an employee can only be exercised while such Optionee remains employed. Such an Optionee shall be deemed to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary during any period of military, sick leave or other leave of absence meeting the requirements of Section 1.421-7(h)(2) of the Federal Income Tax Regulations, or similar or successor section.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.5 <I>Exercise of Option.</I>  An Option may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time during the Option period (or, if determined by the Committee, in specified installments during the Option period) by giving written notice of exercise to the Secretary of the Company specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. Notice of exercise of an Option must be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price by cash, check or money order payable to the order of the Company or in Shares owned by the Optionee for at least six months, having a Fair Market Value at the date of exercise equal to the purchase price, or in a combination of the foregoing. No Shares shall be issued in connection with the exercise of an Option until the full purchase price is received by the Company. An Optionee shall have the rights of a shareholder only with respect to Shares for which certificates have been issued to him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.6 <I>Nontransferability of Options.</I>  No Option granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and such Option shall be exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.7 <I>Retirement, Death or Disability of an Employee or Termination of an Employee as a result of a Reduction in Force.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) If an Option is exercisable in specified installments as provided in Section 6.5 and if an employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of his death, Disability or retirement under a retirement plan of the Company or a Subsidiary at or after his normal retirement date or, with the consent of the Committee, at an early retirement date, his Option shall be exercisable in full, and any restrictions imposed upon the exercise of the Option by reason of any installment requirements shall be of no further force and effect.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If an employee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates by reason of his Disability, he may continue to exercise his Options until the earlier of the date one year from such termination of employment or expiration of the option period provided in the Options pursuant to Section 6.3.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the event of the death of an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, or within the one-year period following the employee's termination of employment by reason of Disability, or within the three-year period following the employee's retirement in accordance with subparagraph (d), any Option granted to him shall be exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of his estate, as the case may be. In such case, the Option shall be exercisable to the extent provided in the Option agreement, but in no event shall such agreement provide that the number of Shares remaining subject to the Option be less than the number of Shares purchasable by the employee on the date of his death nor more than the total number of Shares remaining under the Option. The period during which such Option may be exercised shall end on the earlier of the date one year from the employee's death or expiration of the option period provided in the Option pursuant to Section 6.3. In the event an Option is exercised by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased employee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Shares unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons exercising the Option are the duly appointed legal representatives of the deceased employee's estate or the proper legatees or distributees thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If an employee's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of his retirement under a retirement plan of the Company or a Subsidiary at or after his normal retirement date or, with the consent of the Committee, at an early retirement date, he may exercise his Option until the earlier of the date three years from such termination of employment or the expiration of the Option period provided in the Option pursuant to Section 6.3.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) If an employee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated as a result of a reduction in force, restructuring or similar circumstance (in each case as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), he may exercise his Option until the earlier of (i) the date one year from such termination of employment or (ii) the expiration of the Option period provided in the Option pursuant to Section 6.3.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) In the case of an Option granted to an Eligible Non-Employee, the Committee shall determine how long such Option shall be exercisable following the termination of the advisory, consulting or other service relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.8 <I>Annual Limitation for Incentive Options.</I>  The maximum aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares of the Company or a Subsidiary (determined as of the date of grant of the Incentive Option) for which Incentive Options are exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other incentive stock option plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000 as, and to the extent, required by Section 422(d) of the Code.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.9 <I>Right of First Refusal.</I>  Shares acquired under the Plan by an Optionee may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any way (including a transfer by gift or by reason of the death of the Optionee) until the Optionee (or his legal representative, legatee or distributee of his estate) first offers to sell the Shares to the Company as herein provided. The price per Share at which the Shares shall be offered to the Company shall be the closing price per Share reported on the Consolidated Tape (as such price is reported in <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>or if such publication is unavailable then <I>Reuters</I>) on the date the Optionee's offer is received by the Secretary of the Company. If the Company fails to accept the offer to purchase such Shares within seven days after such date, the Shares shall thereafter be free of all restrictions under the Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.10 <I>Withholding.</I>  No Option may be exercised, by an employee (or the employee's beneficiaries), unless the employee (or the employee's beneficiaries) has paid, or has made provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, federal, state and local income taxes, or any other taxes (other than stock transfer taxes) which the Company may be obligated to collect as a result of such exercise. In its sole discretion, the Committee may permit an employee to satisfy the obligation imposed by this section, in whole or in part, by instructing the Company to withhold up to that number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the employee with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of tax to be withheld. Any fractional share of common stock required to satisfy such tax obligations shall be disregarded and the amount due shall be paid in cash by the employee.</P>
