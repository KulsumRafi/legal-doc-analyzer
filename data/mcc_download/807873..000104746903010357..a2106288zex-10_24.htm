<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and the Company (the "Parties") agree that any dispute arising out of or related to your employment shall be resolved by binding arbitration, except where the
law specifically forbids the use of arbitration as a final and binding remedy, or where subsection&nbsp;(g) below specifically allows a different remedy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
complainant shall provide the other party with a written statement of the claim identifying any supporting witnesses or documents and the requested relief. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
respondent shall furnish a statement of the relief, if any, that it is willing to provide, and identify supporting witnesses or documents. If the matter is not
resolved, the Parties shall submit the dispute to nonbinding mediation, paid for by the Company, before a mediator to be selected by the Parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the matter is not resolved through mediation, the Parties agree that the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration. If the Parties are unable to jointly select
an arbitrator, they will obtain a list of arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and select an arbitrator by striking names from that list. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether the conduct complained of in subsection&nbsp;(a) above violates the complainant's rights and, if so, to
grant any relief authorized by law; subject to the exclusions of subsection (g) below. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to modify, change or refuse to enforce the terms of any employment
agreement between the Parties, or change any lawful policy or benefit plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company will bear the costs of the arbitration if you prevail. If the Company prevails, you will pay half the cost of the arbitration or $500, whichever is less.
Each party shall pay its own attorneys fees, unless the arbitrator orders otherwise pursuant to applicable law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration
shall be the exclusive final remedy for any dispute between the Parties, such as disputes involving claims for discrimination or harassment (such as claims
under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title&nbsp;VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act), wrongful termination,
breach of contract, breach of public policy, physical or mental harm or distress or any other disputes, and the Parties agree that no dispute shall be submitted to arbitration where the complainant
has not complied with the preliminary steps provided for in subsections&nbsp;(a) and (b) above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Parties agree that the arbitration award shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement, so long as the arbitrator's findings of
fact are supported by substantial evidence on the whole and the arbitrator has not made errors of law; however, either party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding or
related to matters involving the Company's confidential, proprietary or trade secret information, or regarding or related to inventions that you may claim to have developed prior to joining the
Company or after joining the Company, pursuant to California Labor Code Section&nbsp;2870 ("Disputes Related to Inventions"). The Parties further agree that for Disputes Related to Inventions that
the Parties have elected to submit to arbitration, each party retains the right to seek preliminary injunctive relief in court in order to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury before
the matter can be heard in arbitration. </FONT></P>
