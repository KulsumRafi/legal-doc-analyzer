the Management GP and the Operating Subsidiary to enter into the Combination Agreement and to agree in the Combination Agreement to enter into the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of the Partnership (the &#147;Partnership Agreement&#148;)

committee of managers of the Management GP following the Transaction. Certain of the Designees may be directors, members, managers and/or officers of or employed by the General Partner, an Operating Company, a GP Party, an entity which possesses
management authority over a GP Party, or a company in which the General Partner or a GP Party has an interest. These Designees will have duties to the Partnership and duties to the General Partner, an Operating Company, the GP Party or such other
