interest that shall have accrued on overdue Interest on this Note as provided in
the preceding sentence and that shall not have been paid in full on or before

provided for in this Section 2, shall be determined to be unlawful, such

law. Any payment by the Borrower of any interest amount in excess of that
permitted by law shall be considered a mistake, with the excess being applied to
