Form</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> within fourteen (14)&nbsp;days after the end of the month during or for which the event occurred which gives rise to the claim for Service Credit. To be considered for
Service Credit with respect to the Installation Guarantee, Customer shall submit a Service Credit Request not later than seven (7)&nbsp;days after the actual installation date, which shall
(a)&nbsp;for Hosting Customers be deemed to be the date that Netifice delivers to Customer the information, including Internet Protocol ("IP") address or addresses, username and password, necessary
for Hosting Customer to access Hosting Customer's Web site and (b)&nbsp;for Co-Location Customers be deemed to be the date that Netifice delivers to Co-Location Customer IP
address or addresses and makes Co-Location Customer's rack space available for installation of Co-Location Customer's equipment. Customer shall be notified of the projected
installation date after Customer's order has been accepted and entered into Netifice's provisioning system by its Account Coordination team. Netifice shall acknowledge receipt of all Service Credit
Request Forms via email no later than the next succeeding business day after such receipt and shall review all requests within 14&nbsp;days after such receipt. Customer shall be notified via email
upon resolution of the request. Unless Customer has been notified of any Unavailability by Netifice, Customer shall have notified the Netifice Network Operations Center
(888-443-7624) of any Unavailability promptly during such Unavailability. Eligibility for Service Credit is based on a failure that is caused solely by a component or
components of Customer's service that is managed by Netifice. </FONT></P>

a scheduled maintenance outage is necessary on an emergency basis to prevent a possible security violation, Netifice can notify the Customer with one-hour advance notice. The Customer will

Egress point, or Internet Gateway. This network latency measurement includes the serialization delay on the WAN interface of the CPE and all network components up to Customer's port and/ or Router. </FONT></P>
