                    shall be deemed final and binding.

          6.1.4     If within the period of 30 Business Days referred to in
                    sub-clause 6.1.3 above the Warrantors notify the Purchaser
                    of any disagreement or difference of opinion relating to the
                    Audited Completion Accounts ("Notice of Disagreement") and
                    if the parties are able to resolve such disagreement or
                    difference of opinion within 10 Business Days of the Notice
                    of Disagreement, the parties shall be deemed to have

                    Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

          6.1.6     The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as
                    an arbitrator, the Arbitration Act 1996 shall not apply and

                    final and binding on the Vendors and the Purchaser for all
                    the purposes of this Agreement. The costs of the Independent
                    Accountant shall be apportioned between the Vendors and the
                    Purchaser as the Independent Accountant shall decide but
                    each party shall be responsible for its own costs of
                    presenting its case to the Independent Accountant.

          6.1.7     Each of the Warrantors and the Purchaser shall, and shall

                    assistance and access to all additional information to each
                    other that they may reasonably require to assist them to
                    make decisions and resolve any disputes under this clause 6

                         virtue of a decision of the Independent Accountant or
                         otherwise) together with interest on the amount to be

                         authorised to receive the same and whose receipt shall
                         be an effective discharge of the Vendor's or
                         Purchaser's obligation to pay such sum and the Vendors
                         or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall not be
                         concerned to see to the application or be answerable
                         for the loss or misapplication of such sums by the
                         Vendors' Solicitors or the Purchaser's Solicitors, as
                         the case may be.

          Where any of the Warranties is made or given "so far as the Warrantors
          are aware", such Warranty shall be deemed to be given to the best of
          the knowledge, information and belief of each of Nicholas Woods, Clive
          Reay-Young, Jennifer Garman and, in relation to Atlantech UK only,
          Simon Mifsud.

7.3       Information supplied by the Companies and Subsidiaries

          Any information supplied by or on behalf of any of the Companies or on
          behalf of any of the Subsidiaries (or by any officer, employee or
          agent of any of them) to the Warrantors or their advisers in
          connection with the Warranties, the Indemnities or the Tax Deed or the
          information Disclosed in the Disclosure Documents shall not constitute
          a warranty, representation or guarantee as to the accuracy of such
          information in favour of the Warrantors and each of the Warrantors
          hereby undertake to the Purchaser to waive irrevocably any and all
          claims which it might otherwise have against the Companies or any of
          the Subsidiaries or against any officer, employee or agent of any of
          them in respect of such claims other than in the case of fraud.

7.4       Separate and independent warranties

          Each of the Warranties set out in the separate paragraphs of schedule
          3 shall be separate and independent and save as expressly otherwise
          provided shall not be limited by reference to any other such Warranty
          or by anything in this Agreement, the Disclosure Documents or the Tax
          Deed.

7.5       Set-off by Purchaser

          7.5.1     The Purchaser shall (without prejudice to its other rights
                    hereunder) be entitled in its discretion to set off against
                    any amount otherwise due and payable to each Warrantor under
                    any of the provisions of clauses 3.3, 3.4 or 6.2 any amount
                    due by such Warrantor to the Purchaser (a) under clause 6.2
                    or clause 9 of this Agreement; (b) under the Tax Deed;
                    and/or (c) pursuant to a Claim in respect of (i) any
                    liability which has been finally determined in accordance
                    with sub-clause 7.5.2 below, and/or (ii) any applicable
                    Contingent Claim Amount provided that the Purchaser has
                    provided the Warrantor with an opinion of counsel of at
                    least 10 years' call that, were such Claim to be the subject
                    of judicial proceedings, the Purchaser would have a
                    reasonable prospect of success in respect thereof. The
                    Purchaser agrees that where it determines to exercise its
                    rights of set-off under this sub-clause 7.5 it shall (save
                    in respect of any sum due to the Purchaser under the Tax
                    Deed or clause 6.2 of this Agreement and without prejudice
                    to its right (as set out above) to set off against any
                    payment due to the Warrantor under sub-clause 6.2) first
                    apply such rights against payment of consideration otherwise
                    due to the Warrantor pursuant to sub-clauses 3.3.3, 3.3.2
                    and 3.3.1 respectively and in such order of priority.

          7.5.2     For the purposes of sub-clause 7.5.1 a liability of a
                    Warrantor shall be deemed to be finally determined when
                    either (i) judgement has been given by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction and the time limit for appeal has expired, or
                    (ii) final appellate judgement has been given with no
                    further right of appeal or (iii) the claim has been settled

                    decision of the Independent Accountant).

          7.5.3     If a claim in respect of which the Purchaser has set off a
                    Contingent Claim Amount is finally determined in accordance
                    with sub-clause 7.5.2 for a lesser amount than the
                    Contingent Claim Amount, the balance of the Contingent Claim
                    Amount in excess of the amount payable as finally determined

                         and otherwise on the terms set out in this Agreement.

          Obligations.

23.2      The Guarantor shall not in any way or to any extent be released from
          its obligations under this agreement by reason of any time or other

          the Vendors to the Purchaser or to any third party or by the
          acceptance of any composition from or the making of any arrangement
          with the Purchaser or any third party or any circumstances or any
          provision or rule of law, whether statutory or otherwise, affecting or
          preventing recovery from the Purchaser of any sum due or rendering any
          debt, obligation or liability of the Purchaser void or unenforceable
          and which but for this provision might operate to exonerate or
          discharge the Guarantor from its obligations to the Vendors under this
          agreement and/or the Tax Deed, and this guarantee shall continue in
          force until the Purchaser or the Guarantor on its behalf shall have
          fully performed and discharged all the Guaranteed Obligations. Any
          settlement or discharge between the Vendors and the Purchaser shall be
          subject to the condition that no security or payment to the Vendors by

          as principal debtor, the Guarantor shall as between the Vendors and
          the Guarantor be deemed principal debtor in respect of the Guaranteed
          Obligations and not merely a surety and accordingly it shall not be
          necessary for the Vendors before seeking to enforce this guarantee to
          seek to enforce any security or lien they may hold from the Purchaser
          or any third party or otherwise to take any steps or proceedings
          against the Purchaser.

                    referred to in clause 24.2.1 above shall not (and shall not

                    any action or proceedings which may arise out of or in
                    connection with this Agreement in any other court of
                    competent jurisdiction (including without limitation in the
                    United Sates of America) nor shall the taking of proceedings
                    in the English courts preclude the taking of any such action
                    or proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction
                    (whether concurrently or not) if and to the extent permitted
                    by applicable law.

4.        Accounts

4.1       General

          The Accounts:

          4.1.1     were prepared in accordance with the requirements of all
                    relevant statutes, with good accounting principles and
                    practices generally accepted at the date hereof in the
                    United Kingdom (including the Accounting Standards) on a
                    basis consistent with the two preceding accounting periods
                    of the Company;

          4.1.2     disclose a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and
                    state of affairs of the Company as at the relevant Balance
                    Sheet Date and of its profits for the financial year ended
                    on such date;

          4.1.3     to the extent required by the CA 85 and the relevant FRSs,
                    contain provision or reserve for bad and doubtful debts,
                    obsolescent or slow-moving stocks and for depreciation on
                    fixed assets, which provision or reserve was when made
                    adequate;

          4.1.4     to the extent required by CA 85 and the relevant FRSs,
                    contain a note of all capital commitments of the Company at
                    the Balance Sheet Date, which note was when made adequate,
                    fair and not misleading;

          4.1.5     to the extent required by CA 85 and the relevant FRSs,

                    contingent liabilities for Taxation);

          4.1.6     the amount included in the Accounts in respect of
                    work-in-progress and stock-in trade is reasonable and has
                    been determined in accordance with SSAP 9; and

          4.1.7     to the extent required by CA 85 and all relevant FRSs,
                    reflect all the fixed and loose plant and machinery,
                    equipment, furniture, fittings and vehicles used by the
                    Company at the Balance Sheet Date and none has been acquired
                    for any consideration in excess of its net realisable value
                    at the date of such acquisition or otherwise than by way of
                    a bargain at arm's length.

4.2       Stock-in-trade and work-in-progress

          The basis of valuation for stock-in-trade and work-in-progress has
          remained in all material respects consistent with that adopted for the
          purpose of the Company's audited accounts in

                                       36

          The profits of the Company for the three years ended on the Balance
          Sheet Date as shown by the Accounts and by the audited accounts of the
          Company for the previous two years delivered to the Purchaser and the
          trend of profits shown by them have not (except as disclosed in them)
          been affected to a material extent by inconsistencies of accounting
          practices, by the inclusion of non-recurring items of income or
          expenditure, by transactions entered into otherwise than on normal
          commercial terms or by any other factors rendering such profits for
          all or any of such periods exceptionally high or low.

4.4       Books of account

          All accounts, books, ledgers, financial and other necessary records of
          whatsoever kind of the Company (including all invoices and other
          records required for VAT purposes):

          4.4.1     have been properly maintained in accordance with applicable
                    law;

          4.4.2     do not as far as the Warrantors are aware contain or reflect
                    any material inaccuracies or discrepancies.

4.5       Management Accounts of the Companies

          The Management Accounts have been prepared in accordance with
          accounting policies consistent with those used in preparation of the
          Accounts with all due care and on a basis consistent with the
          management accounts of the relevant Company prepared in the preceding

                    under a policy effected with an insurance company of good
                    repute and there is no reason why the relevant policies
                    cannot be continued on the same terms following Completion;

          17.2.9    the SSAS has been administered in accordance with the
                    provisions of the SSAS and has been administered in
                    accordance with and comply with all applicable legislation,
                    regulatory requirements and the general requirements of

                         regards eligibility, the rate of contributions or the

                    Chapter IV Part I of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
                    1988 and there is no reason why such approval may be
                    withdrawn; and

          17.2.11   a contracting out certificate under the Pension Schemes Act
                    1993 is in force covering the employments of all Employees
                    who are members of the SSAS and there is no reason why such

                    likely to give rise to any such proceedings;

                         third party any right or interest in respect of any

                    Intellectual Property has been charged, mortgaged, licensed
                    or otherwise encumbered.

          18.3.3    So far as the Warrantors are aware, all Intellectual
                    Property Agreements are valid and binding and none has been
                    the subject of any breach or default by any party or of any
                    event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
                    constitute a default.

          18.3.4    No member of the Group has received notice of any dispute,
                    claim or proceeding arising out of or relating to the

                    aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to

                    are aware, does not infringe any Intellectual Property of a

                    of the Intellectual Property in the conduct of the Business
                    involving the use and exploitation of the Proprietary
                    Intellectual Property or the Third Party Intellectual
                    Property, nor, as far as the Warrantors are aware, will such
                    use or exploitation give rise to any infringement dispute,
                    claims or proceedings against the Company.

          18.4.2    So far as the Warrantors are aware, there are not and have
                    not been any disputes, claims or proceedings threatened or

          18.4.3    So far as the Warrantors are aware, there has been and is no
                    current or anticipated infringement by any third party of

          19.1.1    All IT Systems are owned by the Company or leased under
                    written lease agreements, and are not wholly or partly
                    dependent on any facilities or services not under the
                    exclusive ownership and/or control of the Company.

          19.1.2    So far as the Warrantors are aware, all the IT Contracts are
                    valid and binding and none of the IT Contracts has been the
                    subject of any breach or default, or of any event which
                    (with notice or lapse of time or both) would constitute a
                    default, or is liable to be terminated or otherwise
                    adversely affected by the transaction contemplated by this
                    Agreement.

19.2      Computer operation and maintenance

          19.2.1    All IT Systems are in satisfactory working order and have
                    been and are being properly and regularly maintained and
                    replaced. No part of the IT Systems has materially failed to
                    function at any time during the twelve months prior to the
                    date hereof.

          19.2.2    All IT Services are being and have been provided materially
                    in accordance with the relevant IT Contract.

          19.2.3    The Company has full and unrestricted access to and use of
                    the IT Systems, and no third party agreements or consents
                    are required to enable the Company to continue such access
                    and use following completion of the transaction contemplated
                    by this Agreement.

          19.2.4    So far as the Warrantors are aware it is not necessary for
                    the Company to incur as at the date of Completion any
                    further material expenditure on the modification,
                    development, expansion or (save in the normal course of
                    business) replacement of the IT Systems in order to carry on
                    its Business as at the date of Completion; and

          19.2.5    The Company has not suffered material loss as a result of
                    any virus or other extraneously-induced malfunction, and so
                    far as the Warrantors are aware, no person has had
                    unauthorised access to the IT Systems or any data stored
                    thereon. The Company operates a documented procedure to
                    minimise the risk of such infections and unauthorised
                    access.

          19.2.6    All data processed using the IT Systems and/or the IT
                    Services has been regularly archived in hard copy form. Such
                    hard copies have been properly stored and catalogued.

          19.2.7    The Company has taken all steps reasonably necessary to
                    ensure that its business can continue in the event of a
                    failure of the IT Systems (whether due to natural disaster,
                    power failure or otherwise).

19.3      Euro compliance

          The IT Systems accept payment, process payments and produce invoices
          in Euros.

                         Inland Revenue prior to the date of this Agreement have
                         been so paid, including all Tax chargeable on benefits
                         provided for directors, employees or former employees
                         of the Company or any persons required to be treated as

                    (e)  All payments by the Company to any person which ought
                         to have been made under deduction of Tax have been so

                                   SCHEDULE 8

                       LIMITATION OF WARRANTORS' LIABILITY

                                     PART 1

                               GENERAL LIMITATIONS

1.        Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 6, the Vendors shall not be
          liable in respect of a breach of any of the Warranties if and to the
          extent that the loss occasioned thereby has been recovered under the
          Indemnities or the Tax Deed.

2.        The Warrantors shall not be liable under the Warranties:

2.1       to the extent that the facts which might result in a Claim or possible
          Claim were Disclosed;

2.2       to the extent that the subject of the Claim is allowed or provided for
          or reserved in the Accounts, the Management Accounts or the Completion
          Accounts or was specifically referred to in the notes to any such
          accounts in respect thereof; or

2.3       to the extent that a Claim arises or is increased:

          2.3.1     wholly or partly from an act or omission compelled by law;

          2.3.2     as a result of any increase in rates of Taxation since the
                    date of this Agreement; or

          2.3.3     wholly or partly as a result of the passing or coming into
                    force of or any change in any enactment, law, regulation,
                    directive, requirement or any practice of any government,
                    government department or agency or regulatory body
                    (including but not limited to extra-statutory concessions of
                    the Inland Revenue) after the date of this Agreement whether
                    or not having retrospective effect; or

2.4       if and to the extent that a Claim is increased due to the Purchaser or
          the Guarantor failing to act in all material respects in accordance
          with the provisions of paragraph 5 of this schedule; or

2.5       to the extent that such liability occurs or arises as a result of or
          is otherwise attributable to any voluntary act, transaction or
          omission of either Company or the Subsidiary or the Purchaser or the
          Guarantor or any member of the Purchaser's Group on or after
          Completion; or

2.6       to the extent that such liability occurs or arises wholly as a result
          of any act or omission carried out by the Warrantors at the specific
          request of the Purchaser or the Guarantor after Completion; or

2.7       to the extent that the income, profits or gains in respect of which
          the liability arises were actually earned, accrued or received by
          either Company or the Subsidiary but were not reflected in the
          Accounts or the Management Accounts or Completion Accounts; or

2.8       to the extent that any Claim by the Purchaser or the subject matter
          thereof has been or is made good or is otherwise compensated for
          (otherwise than by the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's
          Group); or

2.9       to the extent that the matter to which it relates

                                       76

<PAGE>

          2.9.1     is or, but for this Agreement, is recoverable by either
                    Company or the Subsidiaries from insurers and the amount is
                    so recovered; or

          2.9.2     is in respect of lost goodwill or possible business
                    following Completion where such loss is unrelated to a
                    Claim.

3.        The Purchaser agrees for itself and on behalf of every member of the
          Purchaser's Group with the Warrantors that in respect of any matter
          which may give rise to a Claim which relates to both Companies:

3.1       no loss, damage, cost, expense or other liability shall be met more
          than once;

3.2       such Claim shall for the purposes of paragraph 6 of this schedule
          shall be separate identifiable and quantifiable in respect of each
          Company.

4.

4.1       Where the Purchaser and/or either Company and/or the Subsidiary is/are
          at any time entitled to recover from some other person (including any
          Tax Authority) any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to a Claim
          the Purchaser shall and shall procure that the relevant Company or the
          Subsidiary shall take all reasonable steps to enforce such recovery
          prior to issuing proceedings against the Warrantors (but, for the
          avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to its right to take action
          against the Warrantors including the right to serve a notice of claim
          on the Warrantors in accordance with paragraph 6.6 of Part 2 and/or
          Part 3 of this Schedule), and in the event that the Purchaser or the
          Company or the Subsidiary shall recover any amount from such other
          person the amount of the Claim against the Warrantors shall be reduced
          by the amount recovered less all costs, charges and expenses
          reasonably incurred by the Purchaser or the Company or the Subsidiary
          in recovering that sum from such other person.

4.2       If the Warrantors pay at any time to the Purchaser or to either
          Company or to a Subsidiary an amount pursuant to a Claim and the
          Purchaser or the Company or a Subsidiary subsequently becomes entitled
          to recover from some other person any sum in respect of any matter
          giving rise to such Claims the Purchaser shall and shall procure that
          the relevant Company or the Subsidiary shall take all reasonable steps
          to enforce such recovery and shall, if successful in such recovery,
          forthwith repay to the Warrantors so much of the amount paid by them
          to the Purchaser or the relevant Company or the Subsidiary as does not
          exceed the sum recovered from such other person less all costs,
          charges and expenses reasonably incurred by the Purchaser or the
          relevant Company or the Subsidiary in recovering that sum from such
          other person.

4.3       If any amount is repaid to the Warrantors by the Purchaser or either
          Company or the Subsidiary pursuant to paragraph 4.2 above an amount
          equal to the amount so repaid shall be deemed never to have been paid
          by the Warrantors for the purposes of Part 2 of this schedule and
          accordingly shall not be treated as an amount in respect of which any
          liability has been incurred.

5.

5.1       If the Purchaser or either Company or a Subsidiary become aware of a
          matter which is reasonably likely to give rise to a Claim:

          5.1.1     the Purchaser shall (or shall procure that the relevant
                    Company or the Subsidiary concerned shall) as soon as
                    reasonably practicable give written notice to each Warrantor
                    of the matter and shall consult with each Warrantor with
                    respect to such

                                       77

<PAGE>

                    matter but such notice shall not be a condition precedent to
                    the liability of the Warrantors;

          5.1.2     the Purchaser shall (and shall procure that the Company or
                    Subsidiary concerned shall) provide to each Warrantor and
                    his advisers reasonable access to premises and personnel and
                    to relevant assets, documents and records within the
                    Purchaser's Group for the purposes of investigating the
                    matter and enabling the Warrantors to take the action
                    referred to in paragraph 5.1.4;

          5.1.3     each Warrantor (at his cost) may take copies of the
                    documents or records, and photograph the premises or assets,
                    referred to in paragraph 5.1.2;

          5.1.4     subject to paragraph 5.1.5 below and the Warrantors
                    accepting unconditionally in writing to the Purchaser
                    liability for a relevant Claim the Purchaser shall (i) (and
                    shall procure that the Company or Subsidiary concerned
                    shall) take such action as the Warrantors may reasonably
                    request in writing to negotiate, avoid, dispute, resist,
                    mitigate, compromise, defend or appeal against any such
                    Claim and any adjudication with respect thereto which shall
                    include (without limitation) the Company or Subsidiary
                    applying to postpone (so far as legally possible) the
                    payment of any taxation and (ii) shall not, and shall ensure
                    that no member of the Purchaser's Group will admit liability
                    in respect of, or compromise, or settle, the matter without
                    the prior written consent of the Warrantors (such consent
                    not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

          5.1.5     the Warrantors shall indemnify and secure the Purchaser and
                    the relevant Company and Subsidiary to their reasonable
                    satisfaction against all losses, damages and expenses
                    including interest on overdue tax and reimburse to the
                    Purchaser and the relevant Company and Subsidiary all
                    out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in
                    complying with their obligations under this paragraph 5;

          clause 9 of this Agreement with respect to paragraphs 6.3 and 6.5
          below):

6.1       shall not arise unless and until the amount of such claim when
          aggregated with other claims based on essentially the same or similar
          facts exceeds *** in respect of any single item;

6.2       shall not arise unless and until the amount of such claim when

          been made but for the operation of this paragraph 6.2 exceeds *** in
          which event all of such claim or claims shall be recoverable hereunder

          details of all material aspects of the Claim including the Purchaser's
          bona fide estimate of the amount thereof. Any such claim shall (if it

                                   SCHEDULE 9

                              SUBSIDIARY WARRANTIES

                                     PART A

                      ATLANTECH MEDICAL DEVICES (USA) INC.

          In this Part A the following words shall have the following meanings:

          "Accounts" means the unaudited monthly management accounts of the
          Subsidiary for the sixteen month period ended on the Accounts Date

          Subsidiary set out under the heading "The Subsidiary" opposite
          Atlantech's name in Schedule 2. Such shares constitute the whole of
          the allotted and issued share capital of the Subsidiary, have been
          properly allotted and issued and there is no agreement, arrangement or
          obligation requiring the creation, allotment, issue, transfer,
          redemption or repayment of, or the grant to any person of the right
          (whether conditional or not) to require the allotment, issue,
          transfer, redemption or repayment of, any shares in the capital of the
          Subsidiary (including, without limitation, an option or right or
          pre-emption or conversion).

3.        There is no litigation, arbitration, prosecution, administrative or
          other legal proceedings or dispute in existence or threatened against
          Atlantech Medical Devices Limited in respect of the shares in the

          them which might give rise to any such proceedings or any such
          dispute.

4.        There is no encumbrance on, over or affecting any of the issued or
          unissued shares in the capital of the Subsidiary and there is no
          agreement or commitment to give or create any encumbrance or
          negotiations which may lead to such an agreement or commitment and no
          claim has been made by any person to be entitled to an encumbrance in
          relation thereto.

5.

          Subsidiary as at the Accounts Date.

5.2       The Accounts have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies
          consistent with US GAAP with all due care. The cumulative profits,
          assets and liabilities of Atlantech Medical Devices (USA) Inc stated
          in the US Accounts have not been knowingly or wilfully misstated.

6.        Since the Accounts Date the Subsidiary has not (other than as
          disclosed in the Accounts):

6.1       acquired any material assets (namely, any asset of a value in excess
          (in aggregate) of US$10,000);

6.2       incurred any material liability (namely, any liability of a value in
          excess (in aggregate) of US$10,000); or

                                       80

<PAGE>

          ordinary course of business.

7.        All the property and assets which are described and included in the
          Accounts or which are used in connection with the business of the
          Subsidiary are:

7.1       legally and beneficially owned by the Subsidiary or used by the
          Subsidiary with the consent of the legal and beneficial owner;

7.2       in the possession or under the control of the Subsidiary;

7.3       free from all encumbrances and there is not any agreement or

          times the Business has been conducted thereon, in all material
          respects in compliance with Environmental Law.

9.        Details of all insurance policies effected by the Subsidiary or by any
          other person in relation to any of the Subsidiary's assets are annexed

          force.

10.       All the accounts, books, registers, ledgers and financial and other
          material records of whatsoever kind of the Subsidiary (including all
          invoices and other records required for customs and excise purposes)
          are materially up to date, in its possession or under its control and
          have been properly and accurately kept and compiled in all material
