The Executive shall
devote substantially all of his working time to the business of the Company and
during the Term shall not take, directly or indirectly, an active role in any
other business without the prior written consent of the Company; but except as
provided in Section 5.3, this Section shall not prevent the Executive from
serving as a director of other entities not affiliated with the Company, from
making real estate or other investments of a passive nature or from
participating in the activities of a charitable organization where such
participation does not adversely affect the Executive&#146;s ability to perform
his duties under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<p align=justify><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2
The Executive will,
upon reasonable notice, during or after the Term of this Employment Agreement,

reasonable compensation for the time expended by him pursuant to this Section
5.2 after the Term. </FONT></P>

<p align=justify><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Executive acknowledges that certain information pertaining to the business and operations
of the Company such as strategic plans, product development, financial costs,
pricing terms, sales data or new or developing business opportunities
(&#147;Confidential Information&#148;), is confidential and is a unique and
valuable asset of the Company. Access to and knowledge of this Confidential
Information are essential to the performance of the Executive&#146;s duties
under this Agreement. The Executive will not during the term of this Agreement
or following termination of his employment except to the extent reasonably
necessary in the performance of his duties under this Agreement, give to any
person, firm, association, corporation or governmental agency any Confidential
Information except as required by law. The Executive will not make use of this
Confidential Information for his own purposes or for the benefit of any person
or organization other than the Company. The Executive will also use his best
efforts to prevent the disclosure of this Confidential Information by others.
All records, memoranda, etc. relating to the business of the Company whether
made by the Executive or otherwise coming into his possession will remain the
property of the Company. </FONT></P>

Control that gives rise to payments to Executive under Section 4.2, the Executive
will not Compete with the Company for one (1) year from the date of termination.
In the event of a Voluntary Termination in which the Executive only receives
payment as defined under Section 4.3, or which follows a Company non-extension
notice under Section 1.1, there will be no restriction on the Executive&#146;s
right to Compete with the Company after the date his employment terminates.
For the purposes of this Section 5.4, the term &#147;Compete with the
Company&#148; means action by the Executive, direct or indirect, either as an
officer, director, stockholder, owner, partner, employee or in any other
capacity, resulting in the Executive having any legal or equitable ownership
or other financial or non-financial interest in or employment with, any HMO,
managed care or health insurance business within a fifty mile radius of any
location where the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company conducts
such business at the date of a termination of the Executive&#146;s employment;
provided, however, that the term &#147;Compete with the Company&#148; shall
not include ownership (without any more extensive relationship) of a less than
a five percent (5%) interest in any publicly-held corporation or other business
entity. The Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained herein are
reasonable as to geographic and temporal scope. The Executive acknowledges that
his breach or threatened or attempted breach of any provision of Section 5.4 may
cause irreparable harm to the Company not compensable in monetary damages and
that the Company may be entitled, in addition to all other applicable remedies,
to a temporary and permanent injunction and a decree for specific performance
of the terms of Section 5.4. </FONT></P>
