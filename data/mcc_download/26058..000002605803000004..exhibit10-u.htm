<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.01
<U>Purpose</U>. It is the intention of CTS Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) to
maintain appropriate levels of retirement benefits for employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries who are entitled to benefits under the CTS Corporation Salaried Employees
Pension Plan (the &#147;Pension Plan&#148;). Accordingly, the Company hereby establishes
the CTS Corporation Excess Benefit Retirement Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). This Plan is
intended to provide benefits to eligible persons in order to maintain the level of total
retirement benefits which, but for the limitation on compensation which may be taken into
account under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the &#147;Code&#148;) would
otherwise be payable under, or as a consequence of, the provisions of the Pension Plan. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.02
<U>Effective Date</U>. This Plan is effective as of July 1, 1996. However, in calculating
the amounts described in Sections 3.01(a) and 3.01(b), amounts which accrued (or would
have accrued) but for the Code limitations referred to in Section 3.01 prior to the
Effective Date shall be taken into account. </FONT></P>

Pension Plan by reason of being the Beneficiary of another individual who was a Member
under this Plan, shall be known as a &#147;Beneficiary&#148; and shall likewise be
entitled to receive any Benefits which such Member was entitled under this Plan. The term

may be distributed, as determined under the Pension Plan. </FONT></P>
