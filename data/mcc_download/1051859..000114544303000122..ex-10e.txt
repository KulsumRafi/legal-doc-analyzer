Section 1. Plan Identity.

      1.1 Name. The name of this Plan is "First Community Bank Restated 401(k)
Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan."

      1.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Plan is to describe the terms and
conditions under which contributions made pursuant to the Plan will be credited
and paid to the Participants and their Beneficiaries.

      1.3 Effective Date. The Effective Date of the 401(k) Plan was, initially,
January 1, 1986. The initial Effective Date of the ESOP portion of the Plan was
October 1, 1993. The Effective Date of the subsequent restatement and
combination of the Plans was October 1, 1997. The Effective Date of this
restatement shall be October 1, 1999. The provisions of this Plan, as a restated
Plan, apply solely to an Employee whose employment with the Employer terminates
on or after the restated Effective Date of the Plan. If an Employee's employment
with the Employer terminates prior to the restated Effective Date, that Employee
is entitled to benefits under the Plan as the Plan existed on the date of the
Employee's termination of employment.

      1.4 Fiscal Period. This Plan shall be operated on the basis of an October
1 to September 30 fiscal year for the purpose of keeping the Plan's books and
records and distributing or filing any reports or returns required by law.

      1.5 Single Plan for All Employers. This Plan shall be treated as a single
plan with respect to all participating Employers for the purpose of crediting
contributions and forfeitures and distributing benefits, determining whether
there has been any termination of Service, and applying the limitations set
forth in Section 5.

      Accordingly, the Plan and Trust Agreement shall be interpreted and applied
in a manner consistent with this intent and shall be administered at all times
and in all respects in a nondiscriminatory manner.

Contribution Account", a "Rollover Account," and an "ESOP Account."

advice of the Participant's executor or administrator as to the identity of the
Participant's Spouse.

      "Break in Service" means any Vesting Year in which an Employee has 500 or
fewer Hours of Service. Solely for this purpose, an Employee shall be considered

(said Employee shall not be credited with more than 501 Hours of Service to
avoid a Break in Service), unless he does not resume his Service at the end of
the Recognized Absence. Further, if an Employee is absent for any period, (i) by

Employee's child, (iii) by reason of the placement of a child with the Employee
in connection with the Employee's adoption of the child, or (iv) for purposes of
caring for such child for a period beginning immediately after such birth or
placement, the Employee shall be credited with the Hours of Service which would
normally have been credited but for such absence, up to a maximum of 501 Hours
of Service.

habitual drunkenness or addiction to narcotics, a criminal act or attempt,
service in the armed forces of any country, an act of war, declared or
undeclared, any injury or disease occurring while compensation to the
Participant is suspended, or any injury which is intentionally self-inflicted.
Further, this term shall apply only if (i) the Participant is sufficiently
disabled to qualify for the payment of disability benefits under the federal
Social Security Act or Veterans Disability Act, or (ii) the Participant's
disability is certified by a physician selected by the Committee. Unless the
Participant is sufficiently disabled to qualify for disability benefits under
the federal Social Security Act or Veterans Disability Act, the Committee may
require the Participant to be appropriately examined from time to time by one or
more physicians chosen by the Committee, and no Participant who refuses to be
examined shall be treated as having a Disability. In any event, the Committee's

Disability shall be final and conclusive.

Effective Date is set forth with respect to a particular section hereof. For

            (b) Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1997, any
      elective deferral as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) (any Employer
      contributions made on behalf of a Participant to the extent not includible

      are not includible in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code

            (c) 415 Compensation in excess of $170,000 (as indexed) shall be
      disregarded for all Participants. For purposes of this sub-section, the

      year. For Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2002, "$200,000"

1996, means an Employee who, during either of that or the immediately preceding
Plan Year was at any time a five percent owner (as defined in Code Section
416(i)(1)) of the Employer or had 415 Compensation exceeding $80,000 (adjusted

      125, 402(a)(8), 402(h)(1)(B), or 403(b) of the Code, and for Plan Years
      commencing on or after January 1, 2001, Section 132(f)(4) of the Code.

            (b) The number of Employees in "the most highly compensated
      one-fifth of all Employees" shall be determined by taking into account all
      individuals working for all related Employer entities described in the
      definition of "Service," but excluding any individual who has not

      "Hours of Service" means hours to be credited to an Employee under the
following rules:

      or is entitled to be paid for a period of vacation, holidays, illness,
      disability, lay-off, jury duty, temporary military duty, or leave of
      absence is an Hour of Service. However, except as otherwise specifically
      provided, no more than 501 Hours of Service shall be credited for any
      single continuous period which an Employee performs no duties. Further, no
      Hours of Service shall be credited on account of payments made solely

      compensation, or disability insurance laws, or to reimburse an Employee
      for medical expenses.

            (c) Each hour for which back pay (ignoring any mitigation of
      damages) is either awarded or agreed to by an Employer is an Hour of
      Service. However, no more than 501 Hours of Service shall be credited for
      any single continuous period during which an Employee would not have
      performed any duties.

            (d) Hours of Service shall be credited in any one period only under
      one of the foregoing paragraphs (a), (b) and (c); an Employee may not get
      double credit for the same period.

            (e) If an Employer finds it impractical to count the actual Hours of
      Service for any class or group of non-hourly Employees, each Employee in
      that class or group shall be credited with 45 Hours of Service for each
      weekly pay period in which he has at least one Hour of Service. However,
      an Employee shall be credited only for his normal working hours during a
      paid absence.

            (f) Hours of Service to be credited on account of a payment to an
      Employee (including back pay) shall be recorded in the period of Service
      for which the payment was made. If the period overlaps two or more Plan
      Years, the Hours of Service credit shall be allocated in proportion to the
      respective portions of the period included in the several Plan Years.
      However, in the case of periods of 31 days or less, the Administrator may
      apply a uniform policy of crediting the Hours of Service to either the
      first Plan Year or the second.

            (g) In all respects an Employee's Hours of Service shall be counted

3.6 Elective Deferral Agreement. Each Eligible Participant may, but shall not be
required to, enter into an Elective Deferral Agreement with the Employer under
which the Participant agrees to reduce his Cash Compensation by a specified
percentage and the Employer agrees to contribute such amounts on the
Participant's behalf to the Trust. The terms of such Elective Deferral Agreement
shall:

      (a) specify the percentage of such Participant's Cash Compensation to be
paid by the Employer on the Participant's behalf each pay period to the Trust;

      (b) provide that the Committee may reduce the percentage in paragraph (a)
if necessary to assure that the applicable limitations on contributions and
allocations set forth in Section 5 are satisfied for each Plan Year;

      (c) specify the date as of which the Elective Deferral Agreement becomes
effective, which date shall be the first day of a future pay period; and

      (d) set forth such other or additional information as in the opinion of
the Committee is desirable or necessary for the operation of the Plan.

      The Committee shall notify each Employee of his eligibility to enter into
an Elective Deferral Agreement and shall forward to such individual a form of
Elective Deferral Agreement to complete. Elective deferral shall commence on
behalf of such Employee with the first Entry Date after he becomes eligible to
participate if such Employee enters into the Elective Deferral Agreement with
the Employer at least fifteen (15) days (or such shorter period as the
Administrator allows) prior to the Entry Date. In the case of an Employee who
does not commence elective deferral at the earliest date possible, such Employee
may commence elective deferral on any date permitted by the Committee by
entering into an Elective Deferral Agreement at least fifteen (15) days (or such
shorter period as the Committee allows) prior to said date. In all cases, the
initiative for applying for elective deferral rests with the individual
Employee.

      A Participant shall be entitled to increase, decrease or resume his or her
Elective Deferral percentage quarterly during the Plan Year. Any such increase,
decrease or resumption shall be effective as of the first payroll period
coincident with or next following the first day of such quarter. A Participant
may completely discontinue making Elective Deferrals at any time effective for
the payroll period after written notice is provided to the Committee.

Section 4. Contributions and Credits.

4.1 Elective Deferral Contributions. Subject to the provisions of Section 5, for
each pay period the Employer shall contribute to the Trust on behalf of each
Participant an amount equal to the dollar amount or a percentage of such
Participant's Cash Compensation specified in the Elective Deferral Agreement
between the Employer and such Participant, up to a maximum of 15% of such
Participant's Cash Compensation for the Plan Year. Each Participant may elect to
increase or decrease the amount rate of his elective deferral or suspend
completely his elective deferral by filing a written request with the Employer.
All elections under this Section 4.1 shall be pursuant to rules of the
Administrator, which shall be consistently applied and which may be changed from
time to time. The Administrator may reduce the amount of any elective deferral,
or make such other modification as necessary, so that the Plan complies with the
provisions of the Code.

4.2 Matching Contributions.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5, for each Plan Year the
Employer shall contribute to the Trust that amount of Matching Contributions as
may be voted by the Board in its sole discretion. Matching Contributions for
each Plan Year shall be credited as of the last day of the Plan Year to the
Accounts of the Active Participants, for whom Elective Deferral Contributions
have been made for such Plan Year. The amount of the Matching Contributions to
be allocated to such an Active Participant shall bear the same ratio to the
total Matching Contributions as the Elective Deferral Contributions of such
Active Participant on or after the Entry Date (for purposes of participation in
Matching Contributions) bears to the total Elective Deferral Contributions of
all such Active Participants.

      (b) Qualified Matching Contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.2, for the purposes of allocations made pursuant to
this Section 4.2, if and to the extent necessary for the Plan to satisfy the
requirements of the Average Contribution Percentage Test at Section 5.4 for a
Plan Year, Qualified Matching Contributions may be made to certain Active
Participants who make an Elective Deferral during such Plan Year, and are not
Highly Compensated Employees with respect to such Plan Year, in the smallest
percentage that, when added to the other contributions tested under the Average
Contribution Test will permit the Plan to pass such test. The Plan Committee
shall have complete discretion to determine those Active Participants that are
not Highly Compensated who shall receive a Qualified Matching Contribution and
the amount of such Contribution.

4.3 Discretionary Contributions.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the Employer shall from time
to time contribute, with respect to a Plan Year, such amounts as it may
determine from time to time. The Employer shall have no obligation to contribute
any amount under this Plan except as so determined in its sole discretion. The
Employer's contributions for a Plan Year shall be credited as of the last day of
the Plan Year to the Accounts of the Active Participants in proportion to their
amounts of Cash Compensation earned on or after the Participant's Entry Date for
participation in Discretionary Contributions.

      (b) Qualified Nonelective Contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.3, for the purposes of allocations made pursuant to
this Section 4.3, if and to the extent necessary for the Plan to satisfy the
requirements of the Average Contribution Percentage Test of Section 5.4 or the
Average Deferral Percentage Test of Section 5.2 for a Plan Year, Qualified
Nonelective Contributions may be made to certain Active Participants who are not
Highly Compensated Employees with respect to such Plan Year in the smallest
percentage that, when added to the other contributions tested under the Deferral
Percentage Test or Average Contribution Percentage Test will permit the Plan to
pass such test. The Plan Committee shall have complete discretion to determine
those Active Participants that are not Highly Compensated who shall receive a
Qualified Nonelective Contribution and the amount of such contribution.

4.4 ESOP

      (a) ESOP Contributions. Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the
Employer shall from time to time contribute, with respect to a Plan Year, such
amounts as it may determine from time to time. The Employer shall have no
obligation to contribute any amount under this section except as so determined
in its sole discretion. The ESOP contributions and available forfeitures for a
Plan Year shall be credited as of the last day of the Plan Year to the Accounts
of the Active Participants in proportion to their amounts of Cash Compensation
earned on or after the Participant's Entry Date for participation in ESOP
Contributions.


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

      (b) Contributions for Stock Obligations . If the Trustee, upon
instructions from the Committee, incurs any Stock Obligation upon the purchase
of Stock, the Employer may contribute for each Plan Year an amount sufficient to
cover all payments of principal and interest as they come due under the terms of
the Stock Obligation. If there is more than one Stock Obligation, the Employer
shall designate the one to which any ESOP Contribution is to be applied.
Investment earnings realized on Employer ESOP Contributions and any dividends
paid by the Employer on Stock held in the Unallocated Stock Account shall be
applied to the Stock Obligation related to that Stock, subject to Section 7.2.

      In each Plan Year in which Employer ESOP Contributions, earnings on ESOP
Contributions, or dividends on unallocated Stock are used as payments under a
Stock Obligation, a certain number of shares of the Stock acquired with that
Stock Obligation which is then held in the Unallocated Stock Fund shall be
released for allocation among the Participants. The number of shares released
shall bear the same ratio to the total number of those shares then held in the
Unallocated Stock Fund (prior to the release) as (i) the principal and interest
payments made on the Stock Obligation in the current Plan Year bears to (ii) the
sum of (i) above, and the remaining principal and interest payments required (or
projected to be required on the basis of the interest rate in effect at the end
of the Plan Year) to satisfy the Stock Obligation.

      At the direction of the Committee, the current and projected payments of
interest under a Stock Obligation may be ignored in calculating the number of
shares to be released in each year if (i) the Stock Obligation provides for
annual payments of principal and interest at a cumulative rate that is not less
rapid at any time than level annual payments of such amounts for 10 years, (ii)
the interest included in any payment is ignored only to the extent that it would
be determined to be interest under standard loan amortization tables, and (iii)
the term of the Stock Obligation, by reason of renewal, extension, or
refinancing, has not exceeded 10 years from the original acquisition of the
Stock.

4.5 Voluntary Contributions. No voluntary after-tax contributions are permitted
under this Plan.

4.6 Definitions Related to Contributions. For the purposes of this Plan, the
following terms have the meanings specified:

      "Active Participant" means a Participant who has satisfied the eligibility
requirements under Section 3.1(a) and who has at least 1,000 Hours of Service
during the current Plan Year. However, a Participant shall not qualify as an
Active Participant unless (i) he is in active Service with an Employer as of the
last day of the Plan Year, or (ii) he is on a Recognized Absence as of that
date, or (iii) his Service terminated during the Plan Year by reason of Early
Retirement, Normal Retirement, Disability or death.

      "Cash Compensation" means a Participant's 415 Compensation as defined in
Section 2 of the Plan, and shall also include amounts contributed under an
Elective Deferral Agreement pursuant to Section 401(k) or a salary reduction
agreement pursuant to Section 125 of the Code or, after December 31, 2000, code
Section 132(f)(4). A Participant's Cash Compensation shall exclude any
compensation in Plan Years beginning before December 31, 2001, in excess of
$150,000 (or the limit currently in effect under Section 401(a)(17) of the
Code). For Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2002, a Participant's
Cash Compensation shall exclude compensation in excess of $200,000 (or the limit
currently in effect under section 401(a)(17) of the Code.)

4.7 Conditions as to Contributions. Employers' contributions shall in all events
be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5. Contributions may be made
in the form of cash, or securities and other property to the extent permissible
under ERISA, including Stock, and shall be held by the Trustee in accordance
with the Trust Agreement. Any contributions of Stock shall be made to
Participants' ESOP Stock Accounts. In addition to the provisions of Section 13.3
for the return of an Employer's


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

contributions in connection with a failure of the Plan to qualify initially
under the Code, any amount contributed by an Employer due to a good faith
mistake of fact, or based upon a good faith but erroneous determination of its
deductibility under Section 404 of the Code, shall be returned to the Employer
within one year after the date on which the contribution was originally made, or
within one year after its nondeductibility has been finally determined. However,
the amount to be returned shall be reduced to take account of any adverse
investment experience within the Trust Fund in order that the balance credited
to each Participant's Account is not less that it would have been if the
contribution had never been made.

4.8 Rollover Contributions.

      Rollover Contributions. Any Participant may make a Rollover Contribution
under the Plan. A Rollover Contribution shall be in cash or in other property
acceptable to the Trustee and shall be a contribution attributable to an
"eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(31)),
distributed to the contributing Employee under Code Section 401(a)(31) from an
eligible retirement plan (as defined in Code Section 401(a)(31).

            The Trustee may condition acceptance of a Rollover Contribution upon
receipt of such documents as it may require. In the event that an Employee makes
a contribution pursuant to this Section 4.8 intended to be a Rollover
Contribution but which did not qualify as a Rollover Contribution, the Trustee
shall distribute to the Employee as soon as practicable after that conclusion is
reached the entire Account balance in his or her Rollover Contributions Account
deriving from such contributions determined as of the Valuation Date coincident
with or immediately preceding such discovery.

4.9 Determination of Contributions. The amounts of any Matching Contributions,
Qualified Matching Contributions, Discretionary Contributions, Qualified
Non-Elective Contributions and ESOP Contributions for each Plan Year shall be
subject to final determination by the Board. The amounts of such contributions,
as determined by the Board, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

4.10 Payment of Contributions. Elective Deferral Contributions made by the
Employer with respect to a pay period shall be paid into the Trust by the
Employer no later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of the month in
which such pay period ends. Matching Contributions, Qualified Matching
Contributions, Discretionary Contributions, Qualified Non-Elective Contributions
and ESOP Contributions made by the Employer to the Trust for each Plan Year
shall be made at such time or times as the Employer determines, but not later
than the time required by law in order for the Employer to obtain a deduction of
the amount of such payment for Federal income tax purposes for such Plan Year
(including extensions thereof), as determined under the applicable provisions of
the Code.

4.11 Participant-Directed Investment of Elective Deferral, Qualified
Non-Elective Contribution, Discretionary Contribution, Matching Contribution,
Qualified Matching Contribution and Rollover Accounts .

      (a) Each Participant shall elect the manner of investment of his Elective
Deferral Contribution, Qualified Non-Elective Contribution, Discretionary
Contribution, Matching Contribution, Qualified Matching Contribution and
Rollover Accounts among the Investment Funds established under the Trust. By
such election, the Participant shall direct the portion of the aggregate amount
then credited or amounts thereafter to be credited to such Accounts that is to
be invested by the Trustee in each of the Investment Funds. The Trustee shall
maintain records at all times adequately reflecting the interest of each Account
in each of the Investment Funds.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

      (b) Each Participant may revoke his investment election as to any amounts
then standing in or thereafter to be credited to his Elective Deferral
Contribution, Qualified Non-Elective Contribution, Discretionary Contribution,
Matching Contribution, Qualified Matching Contribution and Rollover Accounts and
may make a new investment election in accordance with this Section 4.11 only in
accordance with rules established from time to time by the Committee.

      (c) To make an investment election, each Participant shall give written
notice to the Committee, which notice shall be in such form and given at such
time as the Committee may reasonably require. To be effective, such an
investment election must be in accordance with any and all rules and regulations
established by the Committee for this purpose.

      (d) Any investment election made hereunder shall continue to be effective
until properly revoked by the Participant. If, at any time, there shall be no
investment election in effect with respect to a Participant, the Committee shall
direct the Trustee to invest all amounts then standing in or thereafter to be
credited to such Participant's Elective Deferral and Matching Contribution
Accounts in such one or more of the Investment Funds as the Trustee shall, in
its sole discretion, select on a uniform basis for all such Participants.

      (e) The Employer, the Committee and the Trustee shall have no
responsibility for the investment elections of the Participants and shall incur
no liability on account of investing the assets of the Trust in accordance with
such directions, and it is intended that Section 404(c) of ERISA will apply to a
Participant's exercise of investment responsibilities under this Section.

4.12 Valuation of Assets. As of each Valuation Date, the Trustee shall determine
the total net worth of each of the Investment Funds and the total net worth of
the Trust assets by evaluating all of such assets and its liabilities (other
than liabilities covered by Section 6.3) as of that date. In determining the net
worth of such Trust assets, the Trustee shall value such Trust assets at their
fair market value and shall determine the fair market value of assets with no
readily ascertainable market value on any reasonable basis it deems appropriate.
There shall be included as of each Valuation Date income on hand, income
accrued, dividends payable but not paid, and uninvested cash, whether income or
principal; and there shall be deducted as of the Valuation Date liabilities
accrued (other than liabilities covered by Section 6.3). A determination by the
Trustee of the fair market value of any of the Trust assets, or of the net worth
of said Trust assets, or of any Investment Fund, shall be conclusive and binding
upon all persons.

4.13 Allocation of Trust Assets. As of each Valuation Date, the Trustee shall
adjust the Participants' Accounts in accordance with the following subsections
(a), (b), (c) or (d) below to reflect any increase or decrease in the net worth
of the Trust assets.

      (a) Adjustment of Elective Deferral, Qualified Non-Elective Contribution,
Matching Contribution, Qualified Matching Contribution, Discretionary
Contribution, and Rollover Accounts. Each Elective Deferral Account, Qualified
Non-Elective Contributions Account, Matching Contribution Account, Qualified
Matching Contributions Account, and Rollover Account shall be adjusted as of
each Valuation Date to reflect its pro rata share of the effect of income
collected and accrued, realized and unrealized profits and losses, and expenses
of each Investment Fund in which such Accounts have been invested during the
period since the last Valuation Date. Such adjustments shall be made so as to
preserve for each such Account its beneficial interest in the Trust. Unless
otherwise paid by the Employer, the expenses of each Investment Fund shall be
charged to the Accounts invested in such Investment Fund.

      (b) Adjustment of ESOP Accounts. Each ESOP Account (i.e., ESOP Stock
Account and ESOP Cash Account) shall be adjusted as of each Valuation Date to
reflect its pro rata share of the effect


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

of income collected and accrued, realized and unrealized profits and losses and
expenses of the ESOP portion of the Plan since the last Valuation Date. Such
adjustment shall be made so as to preserve for each ESOP Account its beneficial
interest in the ESOP portion of the Plan.

      (c) The Trustee may cause each Account to be adjusted for interim
investment experience related to any distributions from or contributions to the
Account since the last Valuation Date either on the basis of the average Account
balance for the period since the last Valuation Date, or by some other
reasonable and consistently applied method. Adjustment of Accounts for
investment experience shall be deemed to be made as of the Valuation Date to
which the adjustment relates, even if actually made at a later date. The Trustee
shall have no investment responsibility for the ESOP Accounts, but shall accept
any Employer contributions made in the form of Stock, and shall acquire, sell,
exchange, distribute, and otherwise deal with and dispose of Stock in accordance
with the instructions of the Committee.

Section 5. Limitations on Contributions and Allocations.

5.1 Maximum Amount of Elective Deferral Contributions. (a) For each Plan Year,
the Elective Deferral Contributions made on behalf of any Participant under this
Plan and all other plans of the Employer and any Affiliated Employers with a
cash or deferred feature shall not exceed $9,500 (or such greater dollar amount
as may be established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 402(g) of
the Code). For Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, the maximum amount
of Elective Deferral Contributions shall be $11,000. The maximum amount of
Elective Deferral Contribution shall increase by $1,000 for each calendar year
through 2006 (at which time the maximum amount of the Elective Deferral
Contribution shall be $15,000). Thereafter the maximum amount of the Elective
Deferral Contribution shall be indexed for cost-of-living adjustment in
increments of $500, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $500, with a base
quarter of July 1, 2005, in the same manner as under Code Section 415(d).

      (b) No Participant shall be permitted to have Elective Deferral
Contributions made under this Plan, or any other qualified plan maintained by
the Employer during any taxable year in excess of the dollar limitation
contained in Section 402(g) of the Code in effect for such taxable year, except
to the extent permitted in this Section 5.1(b) and section 414(v) of the Code,
if applicable. Beginning in the first Plan year after December 31, 2001, if
elected by the Employer pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, all
Employers who are eligible to make Elective Deferral Contributions under this
Plan and who have attained age 50 before the close of the Plan year shall be
eligible to make catch-up contributions in accordance with, and subject to the
limitations of Section 414(v) of the Code. Such catch-up contributions shall not
be taken into account for purposes of the provisions of Section 5.1(a) hereof or
Section 5.6-2 hereof. Moreover, the Plan shall not be treated as failing to
satisfy Sections 401(k)(3), 401(k)(ii), 401(k)(12), 410(b) or 416 of the Code,
as applicable, by reason of such catch-up contributions.

      (c) If, during any Plan Year, more than the maximum permissible amount
under Section 402(g) of the Code is allocated pursuant to one or more cash or
deferred arrangements to a Participant's Accounts under the Plan and any other
plan described in Sections 401(k), 408(k), or 403(b) of the Code, the following
provisions shall apply:

      (i)   No later than March 1 of the next succeeding Plan Year, the
            Participant may, but is not required to, submit a statement to the
            Committee that all or part of such contributions in excess of the
            maximum permissible amount ("excess deferrals") shall be deemed to
            have been allocated to this Plan. To be effective, such statement
            must be in writing and state that excess deferrals have been made to
            this Plan on behalf of such Participant for the preceding Plan Year;
            and


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

      (ii)  No later than April 1 of the next succeeding Plan Year, the
            Committee may return such excess deferrals, adjusted for income or
            loss allocable thereto, to the Participant.

5.2 Limitation on Elective Deferral Contributions.

      (a) For each Plan Year, the Elective Deferral Contributions of
Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall be
limited to the extent determined to be necessary by the Committee so as to
insure that the test in either (i) or (ii) below (the "ADP Test") is met for
such Plan Year.

      (i)   The Average Deferral Percentage of the Participants who are
            considered Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year is not
            more than the Average Deferral Percentage of all other Participants
            for the preceding Plan Year multiplied by 1.25.

      (ii)  The Average Deferral Percentage of the Participants who are
            considered Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year is not
            more than two (2) percentage points greater than the Average
            Deferral Percentage of all other Participants for the preceding Plan
            Year, and the Average Deferral Percentage of the Participants who
            are considered Highly Compensated Employees is not more than the
            Average Deferral Percentage of all other Participants for the
            preceding Plan Year multiplied by two (2).

      For purposes of this Section 5.2(a), "Average Deferral Percentage" of a
specified group of Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the
ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of (1) the
amount of the Participant's Elective Deferral Contributions and any Qualified
Nonelective Contributions made under this Section for such Participant for such
Plan Year to (2) the Participant's compensation for the Plan Year.

      If two or more plans which include cash or deferred arrangements are
considered as one plan for purposes of Section 401(a)(4) or 410(b), the cash or
deferred arrangements included in such plans shall be treated as one arrangement
for purposes of this Section. In addition, two or more cash or deferred
arrangements may be considered as a single arrangement for purposes of
determining whether or not such arrangements satisfy Code Sections 401(a)(4),
410(b) and 401(k). In such a case, the cash or deferred arrangements included in
such plans and the plans including such arrangements shall be treated as one
arrangement and as one plan for purposes of this Section and Code Sections
401(a)(4), 410(b) and 401(k).

      If any Highly Compensated Employee is a Participant under two or more cash
or deferred arrangements of the Employer, for purposes of determining the Actual
Deferral Percentage with respect to such Employee, all such cash or deferred
arrangements shall be treated as one cash or deferred arrangement.

      (b) In the event the rate of deferrals made by eligible Participants who
are Highly Compensated Employees is in excess of the deferral rate allowed by
this Section, the Employer, in its discretion, may make a special Qualified
Nonelective Contribution for certain Active Participants who are not Highly
Compensated Employees, to be allocated among their Qualified Non-Elective
Contribution Accounts, in order to cause the Plan to satisfy the ADP Test.
Alternatively, the Employer may elect to return excess deferrals to Highly
Compensated Employees in order that the Plan satisfies the ADP Test. Excess
deferrals shall be returned in accordance with the procedure set forth in Code
Section 401(k)(8)(C). Specifically, excess deferrals shall be returned first to
those Highly Compensated Employees with the greatest dollar amount of deferrals,
and so on, until the Plan satisfies the ADP Test. Any income attributable to
excess deferrals shall also be distributed.


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Qualified Nonelective Contributions must be nonforfeitable when made and
distributable only in accordance with the distribution provisions that are
applicable to Elective Deferrals and Qualified Matching Contributions as
described in Section 5.2(d) below, without regard to whether the contributions
are actually taken into account as elective contributions in calculating the
ADP.

      (c) All determinations required under this Section 5.2 shall be made by
the Administrator, and its determination shall be final and binding on all
persons.

      (d) Elective Deferrals, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified
Matching Contributions, and income allocable to each are distributable to a
Participant or his or her Beneficiary or Beneficiaries only under the following
circumstances:

      1.    The Employee's retirement, death, disability or separation from
            service;

      2.    The termination of the Plan without establishment or maintenance of
            another defined contribution plan (other than an ESOP or SEP);

      3.    In the case of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, the Employee's
            attainment of age 59-1/2 or the Employee's hardship;

      4.    The sale or other disposition by the Company to an unrelated
            corporation of substantially all of the assets used in a trade or
            business, but only with respect to Employees who continue employment
            with the acquiring corporation and the acquiring corporation does
            not maintain the Plan after the disposition; and

      5.    The sale or other disposition by the Company of its interest in a
            subsidiary to an unrelated entity, but only with respect to
            Employees who continue employment with the subsidiary and the
            acquiring entity does not maintain the Plan after the disposition.
            Paragraphs 2, 4, and 5, above, apply only if the Company continues
            to maintain the Plan. Nonelective Contributions which may be treated
            as Matching Contributions must satisfy these requirements without
            regard to whether they are actually taken into account as Matching
            Contributions.

      Furthermore, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching
Contributions may be treated as elective contributions only if the following
conditions (described in Section 1.401(k)-1(g)(13)) are satisfied:

      1.    The amount of Qualified Nonelective Contributions, including those
            treated as elective contributions for purposes of the ADP test and
            those treated as matching contributions for purposes of the ACP
            test, satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a)(4).

      2.    The Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching
            Contributions are allocated to the Employee's Account under the Plan
            as of the date within a Plan Year (and is actually paid to the trust
            no later than the end of the 12-month period immediately following
            the Plan Year to which the contribution relates).

5.3 Contributions to be Deductible. For each Plan Year, the Elective Deferral
Contribution under Section 4.1, Qualified Non-Elective Contributions under
Section 4.3(b), Matching Contributions under Section 4.2, Qualified Matching
Contributions under Section 4.2(b), Discretionary Contributions under Section
4.3, and ESOP Contributions under Section 4.4 shall not exceed that amount
which, when added to the contributions made by the Employer for that Plan Year
to all other qualified pension or profit


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

sharing plans maintained by the Employer, equals the maximum amount which is
deductible by the Employer pursuant to Section 404 of the Code with respect to
such Plan Year.

5.4 Limitation on Matching Contributions.

      (a) For each Plan Year, the Matching Contributions that are allocated to
Participants who are considered Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year
shall be limited to the extent determined to be necessary by the Committee so as
to insure that the Average Contribution Percentage for the Participants who are
considered Highly Compensated Employees is not more than the greater of (i) 1.25
times the Average Contribution Percentage of all other Participants for the
preceding Plan Year and (ii) the lesser of two (2) times the Average
Contribution Percentage of all other Participants for the preceding Plan Year
and such Average Contribution Percentage plus two (2) percentage points. The
above test shall be referred to herein as the "ACP Test."

      As used in this Section 5.4, "Average Contribution Percentage" of a
specified group of Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the
ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of (i) the
amount of the Matching Contributions allocated to the Participant for such Plan
Year to (ii) the Participant's compensation for the Plan Year.

      For purposes of this Section, the Actual Contributions Percentage for any
Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee and who is eligible to have
Matching Contributions allocated to his or her Account under two or more plans
described in Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code that are maintained by the
Employer, shall be determined as if the total of such Matching Contributions was
made under a single plan.

      In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Sections 401(m),
401(a)(4) or 410(b) of the Code only if aggregated with one or more other plans,
then this Section shall be applied by determining the Actual Contribution
Percentage of Employees as if all such plans were a single plan. For Plan Years
beginning after December 31, 1989, plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy
Section 401(m) of the Code only if they have the same Plan Year.

      (b) If the Committee determines that the Matching Contributions allocated
to Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees exceed the limitation set
forth above, the Employer may, in its discretion, make a special Qualified
Matching Contribution for certain Active Participants who are not Highly
Compensated Employees, to be allocated among their Qualified Matching
Contribution Accounts, in order to cause the Plan to satisfy the ACP Test.
Alternatively, the Committee shall reduce the Matching Contributions to the
extent necessary to cause the Plan to meet such limitation. The vested portion
of such Matching Contributions so reduced ("Excess Aggregate Contributions"),
adjusted for income or loss allocable thereto, shall be distributed and the
non-vested portion of the Excess Aggregate Contributions, adjusted for income or
loss allocable thereto, shall be forfeited and shall be applied to reduce
subsequent Matching Contributions. The distribution (or forfeiture, if
applicable) of Excess Aggregate Contributions shall be made on the basis of the
respective amounts attributable to each Highly Compensated Employee. The Highly
Compensated Employees subject to actual distribution or forfeiture are
determined using the "dollar leveling method" starting with the Highly
Compensated Employee with the greatest dollar amount of Matching Contributions
for the Plan Year and continuing until the amount of the Excess Aggregate
Contributions has been accounted for.

      (c) All determinations required under this Section 5.4 shall be made by
the Committee, and its determination shall be final and binding on all persons.


                                      -20-

5.5 Multiple Use Test. For Plan years commencing before January 1, 2002, if one
or more Highly Compensated Employees participates in an Elective Deferral
Agreement and the sum of the Actual Deferral Percentage and the Actual
Contribution Percentage of those Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the
"aggregate limit," then the Actual Contribution Percentage of those Highly
Compensated Employees will be reduced, to the extent necessary so that the limit
is not exceeded.

      The amount by which each Highly Compensated Employee's Contribution
Percentage is reduced shall be treated as an Excess Aggregate Contribution. The
Actual Deferral Percentage and Actual Contribution Percentage of the Highly
Compensated Employees are determined after any corrections required to meet the
ADP Test and the ACP Test. Multiple use does not occur if either the Average
Deferral Percentage or Actual Contribution Percentage of the Highly Compensated
Employees does not exceed 1.25 multiplied by the Actual Deferral Percentage and
the Actual Contribution Percentage of the Nonhighly Compensated Employees. (i)
The "aggregate limit" is the sum of (1) 125% of the greater of the Actual
Deferral Percentage for Participants who are Nonhighly Compensated Employees for
the Plan Year or the Actual Deferral Percentage for Participants who are
Nonhighly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year beginning with or within the
Plan Year and (2) the lesser of 200% or two plus the lesser of such Actual
Deferral Percentage or Actual Contribution Percentage. "Lesser" is substituted
for "greater" in "(1)," above, and "greater" is substituted for "lesser" after
"two plus the" in "(2)" if it would result in a larger aggregate limit.

      For Plan years commencing after December 31, 2001, the "multiple use test"
described in this Section 5.5 and in Section 1.401(m)-2 of the Treasury
Regulations is repealed.

      5.6 Limitation on Annual Additions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, allocation of Employer contributions for any Plan Year shall be
subject to the following:

            5.6-1 If allocation of ESOP Contributions in accordance with Section
      4.4 will result in an allocation of more than one-third the total ESOP
      contributions for a Plan Year to the accounts of Highly Compensated
      Employees, then allocation of such amount shall be adjusted so that such
      excess will not occur.

            5.6-2 After adjustment, if any, required by the preceding paragraph,
      the annual additions during any Plan Year to any Participant's Account
      under this and any other defined contribution plans maintained by the
      Employer or an affiliate (within the purview of Section 414(b), (c) and
      (m) and Section 415(h) of the Code, which affiliate shall be deemed the
      Employer for this purpose) shall not exceed the lesser of $30,000 (or such
      other dollar amount which results from cost-of-living adjustments under
      Section 415(d) of the Code) (the "dollar limitation") or 25 percent of the
      Participant's 415 Compensation for such limitation year (the "percentage
      limitation"). For Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2002, the
      dollar limitation shall be increased to $40,000 (or such other amount
      which results from cost-of-living adjustments under Section 415(d) of the
      Code) and the percentage limitation shall be increased to 100%; provided,
      however, that the percentage limitation shall not apply to any
      contribution for medical benefits after separation from service (within
      the meaning of Section 401(h) or Section 419(f)(2) of the Code) which is
      otherwise treated as an annual addition. In the event that annual
      additions exceed the aforesaid limitations, they shall be reduced in the
      following priority:

                  (i) Any reductions required pursuant to the foregoing
            limitations shall be made first with respect to the Participant's
            Elective Deferral Contributions, and such reduction shall be
            returned to the Participant.


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) Any further reduction shall then be made, in the
            following sequence, with respect to (a) Matching Contributions and
            Forfeitures from Matching Contribution Accounts, (b) Discretionary
            Contributions and Forfeitures from Discretionary Contribution
            Accounts, and finally (c) ESOP Contributions and Forfeitures from
            ESOP Accounts. The amount of such reduction shall be allocated and
            credited pursuant to the procedures outlined in Sections 4.2, 4.3
            and 4.4 to the Accounts of remaining Participants, exclusive of any
            other Participant for whom a reduction in Matching Contributions,
            Discretionary Contributions, ESOP Contributions and Forfeitures for
            such Plan Year has been required pursuant to this Section 5.6-2.
            This process shall be repeated until no Participant has been
            allocated excess annual additions. Any amount which cannot be
            allocated pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be held
            unallocated in a suspense account by the Committee and shall be
            allocated in the succeeding limitation year.

                  (iii) If a suspense account is in existence at any time during
            a limitation year, it will not participate in any allocation of
            investment gains and losses. All amounts held in suspense accounts
            must be allocated to Participants' Accounts before any contributions
            may be made to the Plan for the limitation year.

                  (iv) If a suspense account exists at the time of Plan
            termination, amounts held in the suspense account that cannot be
            allocated shall revert to the Employer.

            5.6-3 For purposes of this Section 5.6 and the following Section
      5.7, the "annual addition" to a Participant's Accounts means the sum of
      (i) Employer contributions, (ii) Employee contributions, if any, and (iii)
      forfeitures. Annual additions to a defined contribution plan also include
      amounts allocated, after March 31, 1984, to an individual medical account,
      as defined in Section 415(l)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is
      part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the Employer, amounts
      derived from contributions paid or accrued after December 31, 1985, in
      taxable years ending after such date, which are attributable to
      post-retirement medical benefits allocated to the separate account of a
      Key Employee under a welfare benefit fund, as defined in Section 419A(d)
      of the Internal Revenue Code, maintained by the Employer. The $30,000
      limitations referred to in Section 5.6-2 hereof (as increased to $40,000
      for Plan years commencing on or after January 1, 2002) shall be
      automatically adjusted to the new dollar limitations determined by the
      Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the calendar year beginning in that
      limitation year.

            5.6-4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no more than one-third of
      the ESOP Contributions to the Plan for a year which are deductible under
      Section 404(a)(9) of the Code are allocated to Highly Compensated
      Employees, the limitations imposed herein shall not apply to:

                  (i) forfeitures of Employer securities (within the meaning of
            Section 409 of the Code) under the Plan if such securities were
            acquired with the proceeds of a loan described in Section
            404(a)(9)(A) of the Code), or

                  (ii) ESOP Contributions applied to the repayment of interest
            on an ESOP loan.


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

            5.6-5 If the Employer contributes amounts, on behalf of Employees
      covered by this Plan, to other "defined contribution plans" as defined in
      Section 3(34) of ERISA, the limitation on annual additions provided in
      this Section shall be applied to annual additions in the aggregate to this
      Plan and to such other plans. Reduction of annual additions, where
      required, shall be accomplished first by reductions under such other plan
      pursuant to the directions of the named fiduciary for administration of
      such other plans or under priorities, if any, established under the terms
      of such other plans and then by allocating any remaining excess for this
      Plan in the manner and priority set out above with respect to this Plan.

            5.6-6 A limitation year shall mean each 12 consecutive month period
      beginning each October 1.

      5.7 Effect of Limitations. The Committee shall take whatever action may be
necessary from time to time to assure compliance with the limitations set forth
in Sections 5.6. Specifically, the Committee shall see that each Employer
restrict its contributions for any Plan Year to an amount which, taking into
account the amount of available forfeitures, may be completely allocated to the
Participants consistent with those limitations. Where the limitations would
otherwise be exceeded by any Participant, further allocations to the Participant
shall be curtailed to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations. Where an
excessive amount is contributed on account of a mistake as to one or more
Participants' compensation, or there is an amount of forfeitures which may not
be credited in the Plan Year in which it becomes available, the amount shall be
corrected in accordance with Section 5.6-2 of the Plan.

      5.8 Limitations as to Certain Participants. Aside from the limitations set
forth in Section 5.6, if the Plan acquires any Stock in a transaction as to
which a selling shareholder or the estate of a deceased shareholder is claiming
the benefit of Section 1042 of the Code, the Committee shall see that none of
such Stock, and no other assets in lieu of such Stock, are allocated to the
Accounts of certain Participants in order to comply with Section 409(n) of the
Code.

      This restriction shall apply at all times to a Participant who owns
(taking into account the attribution rules under Section 318(a) of the Code,
without regard to the exception for employee plan trusts in Section
318(a)(2)(B)(i)) more than 25 percent of any class of stock of a corporation
which issued the Stock acquired by the Plan, or another corporation within the
same controlled group, as defined in Section 409(l)(4) of the Code (any such
class of stock hereafter called a "Related Class"). For this purpose, a
Participant who owns more than 25 percent of any Related Class at any time
within the one year preceding the Plan's purchase of the Stock shall be subject
to the restriction as to all allocations of the Stock, but any other Participant
shall be subject to the restriction only as to allocations which occur at a time
when he owns more than 25 percent of any Related Class.

      Further, this restriction shall apply to the selling shareholder claiming
the benefit of Section 1042 and any other Participant who is related to such a
shareholder within the meaning of Section 267(b) of the Code, during the period
beginning on the date of sale and ending on the later of (1) the date that is
ten years after the date of sale, or (2) the date of the Plan allocation
attributable to the final payment of acquisition indebtedness incurred in
connection with the sale.

      This restriction shall not apply to any Participant who is a lineal
descendant of a selling shareholder if the aggregate amounts allocated under the
Plan for the benefit of all such descendants do not exceed five percent of the
Stock acquired from the shareholder.

Section 6. Trust Fund and Its Investment.

      6.1 Creation of Trust Fund. All amounts received under the Plan from
Employers and investments shall be held in the Trust Fund pursuant to the terms
of this Plan and of the Trust Agreement between the Bank and the Trustee. The
benefits described in this Plan shall be payable only from the assets of the
Trust Fund, and none of the Bank, any other Employer, its board of directors or
trustees, its stockholders, its officers, its employees, the Committee, and the
Trustee shall be liable for payment of any benefit under this Plan except from
the Trust Fund.

      6.2 Investments.

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in (b), (c) and (d) below, the Trustee
shall invest and reinvest the funds of the Trust and keep the same invested,
without distinction between principal and income, in such stocks, bonds or other
securities, certificates of participation or shares of any mutual investment
company, individual or group investment or annuity contracts issued by any
insurance company, bank deposits which bear a reasonable rate of interest,
including deposits with the Employer, or any other property of any kind, real or
personal, tangible or intangible, as it may deem advisable; provided that the
Trustee may hold funds uninvested if and to the extent that it deems advisable
from time to time. The Trustee is authorized to commingle part or all of the
assets of the Trust in one or more trusts, whether now existing or hereafter
created, for the collective investment of funds held under employees' pension or
profit sharing plans or trusts which are qualified within the meaning of and
exempt from tax under the revenue laws of the United States and permitted by
existing or future rulings of the United States Treasury Department to pool
their respective funds in a group trust.

      (b) Investment Funds. The Trustee shall establish and maintain one or more
Investment Funds within the Trust and shall invest assets allocated to the
Participants' Elective Deferral, Qualified Non-Elective Contribution,
Discretionary Contribution, Matching Contribution, Qualified Matching
Contribution and Rollover Accounts, and all amounts as to which an election to
diversify under Section 6.4 applies, among the Investment Funds in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4.11 and the investment elections submitted by
the Participants in accordance with such Section. All dividends, capital gains,
or other similar distributions received with respect to an Investment Fund
(unless received in additional shares or investment units of such Investment
Fund) shall be reinvested in the same Investment Fund. However, if an Investment
Fund prohibits reinvestment in the same Investment Fund, all dividends, capital
gains, or other similar distributions received with respect to that Investment
Fund shall be invested in the other Investment Funds in accordance with the
current investment direction of the Participant. If any distribution with
respect to an Investment Fund may be received at the election of the holder of
shares or investment units in such Investment Fund in the form of additional
shares or investment units or in cash or other property, the Trustee shall elect
to receive it in additional shares or investment units of the Investment Fund.

      (c) The Trustee shall, at the discretion of the Committee, invest and
reinvest the funds held under the ESOP Accounts (except portions invested
pursuant to Section 6.4) exclusively in shares of Stock. The Trustee shall, in
investing and reinvesting the Trust, comply with all the requirements of ERISA.
To the extent permitted by applicable law and regulations, the Trustee may
invest the funds held in the ESOP Cash Account, on an interim basis, in
short-term fixed income securities, including any pooled fund which it maintains
and which is primarily invested in such securities (and in such event, the
instrument establishing such pooled fund shall be deemed a part of this Plan).

      (d) Appointment of Investment Managers. The Employer from time to time may
appoint one or more Investment Managers (as that term is defined in Section
3(38) of ERISA) to manage (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all or
any portion or portions of the Trust. The Employer may enter


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

into such agreements setting forth the terms and conditions of any such
appointment as it determines to be appropriate. The Employer shall retain the
right to remove and discharge any Investment Manager. The compensation of such
Investment Managers shall be an expense that may be charged to the Trust. The
Employer shall notify the Trustee of the appointment of any Investment Manager
by delivering to the Trustee an executed copy of the agreement under which such
Investment Manager was appointed together with a written acknowledgment by such
Investment Manager that it (a) is a fiduciary with respect to the Plan, (b) is
bonded as required by ERISA, and (c) either (i) is registered as an investment
advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or (ii) is a bank as defined
in said Act, or (iii) is an insurance company qualified to perform investment
management services under the laws of more than one state of the United States.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon such notice until such time as the
Employer shall notify and direct the Trustee in writing that another Investment
Manager has been appointed in the place and stead of the first-named Investment
Manager, or in the alternative, that the Investment Manager has been removed.
The Trustee shall carry out the written instructions of any Investment Manager
with respect to the management and investment of the assets then under the
control of such Investment Manager and shall not incur any liability on account
of its compliance with such instructions. Purchase and sale orders may be placed
by such Investment Manager directly with brokers and dealers without the
intervention of the Trustee and, in such event, the Trustee's sole obligation
shall be to make payment for purchased securities and deliver those that have
been sold when advised of the transaction. The Trustee shall not incur any
liability on account of its failure to exercise any of the powers delegated to
any Investment Manager because of the failure of such Investment Manager to give
instructions for the management of the assets under the control of such
Investment Manager. The Trustee shall be under no duty to question any
Investment Manager, nor to review any securities or other property acquired or
retained at the direction of any Investment Manager, nor to make any suggestions
to any Investment Manager in connection therewith.

      Each Investment Manager shall have the authority to exercise all of the
powers of the Trustee hereunder with respect to assets under its control but
only to the extent that such powers relate to the investment of such assets. In
addition, each Investment Manager appointed hereunder is hereby authorized to
direct the investment of any part or all of the assets of the Trust in any one
or more trusts, now or hereafter maintained by the Investment Manager or by a
bank or trust company which is an affiliate of the Investment Manager for the
collective investment of funds held in trust, including but not limited to
trusts for the investment of funds held under employees' pension or profit
sharing plans or trusts which are qualified within the meaning of and exempt
from tax under the revenue laws of the United States, and permitted by existing
or future rulings of the United States Treasury Department to pool their
respective funds in a group trust. In the event that trust assets are invested
in any such collective investment trust, then the instrument pursuant to which
such collective investment trust is established shall be deemed a part of this
Plan and is specifically incorporated herein.

      6.3 Acquisition of Stock. From time to time the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, direct the Trustee to acquire Stock from the issuing Employer or
from shareholders, including shareholders who are or have been Employees,
Participants, or fiduciaries with respect to the Plan. The Trustee shall pay for
such Stock no more than its fair market value, which shall be determined
conclusively by the Committee pursuant to Section 12.4. The Committee may direct
the Trustee to finance the acquisition of Stock by incurring or assuming
indebtedness to the seller or another party which indebtedness shall be called a
"Stock Obligation." The term "Stock Obligation" shall refer to a loan made to
the Plan by a disqualified person within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(2) of
the Code, or a loan to the Plan which is guaranteed by a disqualified person. A
Stock Obligation includes a direct loan of cash, a purchase-money transaction,
and an assumption of an obligation of a tax-qualified employee stock ownership
plan under Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code ("ESOP"). For these purposes, the term
"guarantee" shall include an unsecured guarantee and the use of assets of a
disqualified person as collateral for a loan, even though the use of assets may
not be a guarantee under applicable state law. An


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

amendment of a Stock Obligation in order to qualify as an "exempt loan" is not a
refinancing of the Stock Obligation or the making of another Stock Obligation.
The term "exempt loan" refers to a loan that satisfies the provisions of this
paragraph. A "non-exempt loan" fails to satisfy this paragraph. Any Stock
Obligation shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:

            6.3-1 A Stock Obligation shall be for a specific term, shall not be
      payable on demand except in the event of default, and shall bear a
      reasonable rate of interest.

            6.3-2 A Stock Obligation may, but need not, be secured by a
      collateral pledge of either the Stock acquired in exchange for the Stock
      Obligation, or the Stock previously pledged in connection with a prior
      Stock Obligation which is being repaid with the proceeds of the current
      Stock Obligation. No other assets of the Plan and Trust may be used as
      collateral for a Stock Obligation, and no creditor under a Stock
      Obligation shall have any right or recourse to any Plan and Trust assets
      other than Stock remaining subject to a collateral pledge.

            6.3-3 Any pledge of Stock to secure a Stock Obligation must provide
      for the release of pledged Stock in connection with payments on the Stock
      obligations in the ratio prescribed in Section 4.4.

            6.3-4 Repayments of principal and interest on any Stock Obligation
      shall be made by the Trustee only from Employer cash contributions
      designated for such payments, from earnings on such contributions, and
      from cash dividends received on Stock held in the Unallocated Stock Fund.

            6.3-5 In the event of default of a Stock Obligation, the value of
      Plan assets transferred in satisfaction of the Stock Obligation must not
      exceed the amount of the default. If the lender is a disqualified person
      within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, a Stock Obligation must
      provide for a transfer of Plan assets upon default only upon and to the
      extent of the failure of the Plan to meet the payment schedule of said
      Stock Obligation. For purposes of this paragraph, the making of a
      guarantee does not make a person a lender.

      6.4 Participants' Option to Diversify. The Committee shall provide for a
procedure under which each Participant may, during the qualified election
period, elect to "diversify" a portion of the Employer Stock allocated to his
ESOP Stock Account, as provided in Section 401(a)(28)(B) of the Code. An
election to diversify must be made on the prescribed form and filed with the
Committee within the period specified herein. For each of the first five (5)
Plan years in the qualified election period, the Participant may elect to
diversify an amount which does not exceed 25% of the number of shares allocated
to his ESOP Stock Account since the inception of the Plan, less all shares with
respect to which an election under this Section has already been made. For the
last year of the qualified election period, the Participant may elect to have up
to 50 % of the value of his ESOP Stock Account committed to other investments,
less all shares with respect to which an election under this Section has already
been made. The term "qualified election period" shall mean the six (6) Plan Year
period beginning with the first Plan Year in which a Participant has both
attained age 55 and completed 10 years of participation in the Plan. A
Participant's election to diversify his Account may be made within each year of
the qualified election period and shall continue for the 90-day period
immediately following the last day of each year in the qualified election
period. Once a Participant makes such election, the Plan must complete
diversification in accordance with such election within 90 days after the end of
the period during which the election could be made for the Plan Year. In the
discretion of the Committee, the Plan may satisfy the diversification
requirement by any of the following methods:


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

            6.4-1 The Plan may distribute all or part of the amount subject to
      the diversification election.

            6.4-2 The Plan may offer the Participant at least three other
      distinct investment options, if available under the Plan. The other
      investment options shall satisfy the requirements of Regulations under
      Section 404(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
      amended ("ERISA").

            6.4-3 The Plan may transfer the portion of the Participant's ESOP
      Stock Account subject to the diversification election to another qualified
      defined contribution plan of the Employer that offers at least three
      investment options satisfying the requirements of the Regulations under
      Section 404(c) of ERISA.

Section 7. Voting Rights and Dividends on Stock.

      7.1 Voting and Tendering of Stock. The Trustee generally shall vote all
shares of Stock held under the Plan in accordance with the written instructions
of the Committee. However, if any Employer has registration-type class of
securities within the meaning of Section 409(e)(4) of the Code, or if a matter
submitted to the holders of the Stock involves a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reclassification, liquidation, dissolution, or sale of
substantially all assets of an entity, then (i) the shares of Stock which have
been allocated to Participants' Accounts shall be voted by the Trustee in
accordance with the Participants' written instructions, and (ii) the Trustee
shall vote any unallocated Stock in a manner calculated to most accurately
reflect the instructions it has received from Participants regarding the
allocated Stock. In the event no shares of Stock have been allocated to
Participants' Accounts at the time Stock is to be voted, each Participant shall
be deemed to have one share of Stock allocated to his or her Account for the
sole purpose of providing the Trustee with voting instructions.

      Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, all unallocated
shares of Stock must be voted by the Trustee in a manner determined by the
Trustee to be for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and Beneficiaries.
Whenever such voting rights are to be exercised, the Employers, the Committee,
and the Trustee shall see that all Participants are provided with the same
notices and other materials as are provided to other holders of the Stock, and
are provided with adequate opportunity to deliver their instructions to the
Trustee regarding the voting of Stock allocated to their Accounts. The
instructions of the Participants' with respect to the voting of allocated shares
hereunder shall be confidential.

            7.1-1 In the event of a tender offer, Stock shall be tendered by the
      Trustee in the same manner as set forth above with respect to the voting
      of Stock. Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, Stock
      must be tendered by the Trustee in a manner determined by the Trustee to
      be for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and Beneficiaries.

      7.2 Dividends on Stock. Dividends on Stock which are received by the
Trustee in the form of additional Stock shall be retained in the ESOP Stock
Account, and shall be allocated among the Participant's Accounts and the
Unallocated Stock Fund in accordance with their holdings of the Stock on which
the dividends have been paid. Dividends on Stock credited to Participants' ESOP
Stock Accounts which are received by the Trustee in the form of cash shall, at
the direction of the Employer paying the dividends, either (i) be credited to
the ESOP Cash Account in accordance with Section 4.13 and invested in accordance
with Section 6.2(c), (ii) be distributed immediately to the Participants in
proportion with the Participants' ESOP Stock Account balance, (iii) be
distributed to the Participants within 90 days of the close of the Plan Year in
which paid in proportion with the Participants' ESOP Stock Account balance, or
(iv) be used to make payment on the Stock Obligation. If dividends on Stock
allocated to a


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Participant's ESOP Stock Account are used to repay the Stock Obligation, Stock
with a fair market value equal to the dividends so used must be allocated to
such Participant's ESOP Stock Account in lieu of the dividends. Dividends on
Stock held in the Unallocated Stock Fund which are received by the Trustee in
the form of cash shall be allocated to Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts (pro
rata based on the Participant's ESOP Cash Account balance in relation to all
Participants' ESOP Cash Account balances) and shall be applied as soon as
practicable to payments of principal and interest under the Stock Obligation
incurred with the purchase of the Stock.

Section 8. Adjustments to Accounts.

      8.1 Adjustments for Transactions. An Employer contribution pursuant to
Section 4.3 shall be credited to the Participants' Accounts as of the last day
of the Plan Year for which it is contributed in accordance with Section 4.3.
Stock released from the Unallocated Stock Fund upon the Trust's repayment of a
Stock Obligation pursuant to Section 4.4 shall be credited to the Participants'
ESOP Stock Accounts as of the last day of the Plan Year in which the repayment
occurred, pro rata based on the cash applied from such Participant's ESOP Cash
Account relative to the cash applied from all Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts.
Any excess amounts remaining from the use of proceeds of a sale of Stock from
the Unallocated Stock Fund to repay a Stock Obligation shall be allocated as
earnings of the Plan as of the last day of the Plan Year in which the repayment
occurred among the Participants' ESOP Cash Accounts in proportion to the opening
balance in each Account. Any benefit which is paid to a Participant or
Beneficiary pursuant to Section 10 shall be charged to the Participant's Account
as of the first day of the Valuation Period in which it is paid. Any forfeiture
or restoral shall be charged or credited to the Participant's Account as of the
first day of the Valuation Period in which the forfeiture or restoral occurs
pursuant to Section 9.6.

Section 9. Vesting of Participants' Interests.

      9.1(a)Deferred Vesting in Accounts. A Participant's vested interest in his
ESOP, Discretionary Contribution and Matching Contribution Accounts shall be
based on his Vesting Years in accordance with the following Table, subject to
the balance of this Section 9:

            Vesting                    Percentage of
             Years                    Interest Vested
             -----                    ---------------

            Fewer than 5                      0%
            5 or more                       100%

      A Participant shall be entitled to a vested benefit equal to the entire
amount standing to the credit of his Elective Deferral Account, Qualified
Non-Elective Contribution Account, Qualified Matching Contribution Account
and Rollover Account.

      9.1(b) Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, all
Participants with accrued benefits derived from Matching Contributions shall be
nonforfeitable in accordance with the following schedule:

            Vesting                    Percentage of
             Years                    Interest Vested
             -----                    ---------------

            Fewer than 3                      0%
            3 or more                       100%


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

      9.2 Computation of Vesting Years. For purposes of this Plan, a "Vesting
Year" means a Plan Year in which an Employee has at least 1,000 Hours of
Service, beginning with the first Plan Year in which the Employee has completed
an Hour of Service with the Employer, and including Service with other employers
as provided in the definition of "Service." However, a Participant's Vesting
Years shall be computed subject to the following conditions and qualifications:

      (a) A Participant's vested interest in his Account accumulated before five
(5) consecutive Breaks in Service shall be determined without regard to any
Service after such five consecutive Breaks in Service. Further, if a Participant
has five (5) consecutive Breaks in Service before his interest in his Account
has become vested to some extent, pre-Break years of Service shall not be
required to be taken into account for purposes of determining his post-Break
vested percentage.

      (b) Unless otherwise specifically excluded, a Participant's Vesting Years
shall include any period of active military duty to the extent required by the
Military Selective Service Act of 1967 (38 U.S.C. Section 2021).

      9.3.1 Full Vesting Upon Certain Events. Notwithstanding Section 9.1, a
Participant's interest in his Account shall fully vest on the Participant's
Normal Retirement Date, provided the Participant is in Service on or after that
date. The Participant's interest shall also fully vest in the event that his
Service is terminated by Early Retirement, Disability or by death.

      9.3.2 Full Vesting Upon a Change in Control. The Participant's interest in
his Account shall also fully vest in the event of a Change in Control of the
Bank, or the Company. For these purposes "Change in Control" means an event of a
nature that: (i) would be required to be reported in response to Item 1 of the
current report on Form 8-K, as in effect on the date hereof, pursuant to Section
13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"); or (ii)
results in a Change in Control of the Bank or the Company within the meaning of
the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 and the Rules and Regulations promulgated by
the Office of Thrift Supervision, as in effect on the date hereof; or (iii)
without limitation such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred at
such time as (a) any "Person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Bank
or the Company representing 25% or more of the Bank's or the Company's
outstanding securities except that securities issued by the bank, in connection
with its initial public offering, to the Company and/or the Bank's employee
benefit plans and that continue to be held by such Company or plans shall not be
counted in determining whether such Company or plans are the beneficial owner of
more than 25% of the Bank's securities; or (b) individuals who constitute the
Board on the date hereof (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a
director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was approved by a vote of
at least two-thirds of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board or whose
nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by the same
Nominating Committee serving under an Incumbent Board, shall be, for purposes of
this clause (b), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent Board;
or (c) a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
the assets of the Bank or the Company or similar transaction in which the Bank
or Company is not the resulting entity occurs; or (d) a tender offer is made for
25% or more of the outstanding securities of the Bank or Company and
shareholders owning beneficially or of record 25% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Bank or Company have tendered or offered to sell their shares
pursuant to such tender offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in
Control" of the Bank or the Company shall not be deemed to have occurred if the
Company ceases to own at least 51% of all outstanding shares of stock of the
Bank in connection with a conversion of the Company from mutual to stock form.

      9.4 Full Vesting Upon Plan Termination. Notwithstanding Section 9.1, a
Participant's interest in his Account shall fully vest upon termination of this
Plan or upon the permanent and complete


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

discontinuance of contributions by his Employer. In the event of a partial
termination, the interest of each affected Participant shall fully vest with
respect to that part of the Plan which is terminated.

      9.5 Forfeiture, Repayment, and Restoral. If a Participant's Service
terminates before his interest in his Matching Contribution Account,
Discretionary Contribution Account, and ESOP Account is fully vested, that
portion which has not vested shall be forfeited if he either (i) receives a
distribution of his entire vested interest pursuant to Section 10.1, or (ii)
incurs five (5) consecutive one year Breaks In Service. If a Participant's
Service terminates prior to having any portion of his Account become vested,
such Participant shall be deemed to have a received a distribution of his vested
interest as of the Valuation Date next following his termination of Service.

      If a Participant who has received his entire vested interest returns to
Service before he has five consecutive Breaks in Service, he may repay to the
Trustee an amount equal to the distribution. The Participant may repay such
amount at any time within five years after he has returned to Service. The
amount shall be credited to his Account at the time it is repaid; an additional
amount equal to that portion of his Matching Contribution, Discretionary
Contribution, and ESOP Accounts which were previously forfeited shall be
restored to such Accounts at the same time from other Employees' forfeitures
and, if such forfeitures are insufficient, from a special contribution by his
Employer for that year. A Participant who was deemed to have received a
distribution of his vested interest in the Plan shall have his Accounts restored
as of the first day on which he performs an Hour of Service after his return.

      9.6 Accounting for Forfeitures.

      (a) Matching Contributions. If a portion of a Participant's Matching
Contribution Account is forfeited, the forfeitures shall be used to reduce
Matching Contributions for the succeeding Plan Year, subject to the restoral
provisions of Section 9.5.

      (b) Discretionary Contributions. If a portion of a Participant's
Discretionary Contribution Account is forfeited, the forfeitures shall be used
to reduce Discretionary Contributions for the succeeding Plan Year, subject to
the restoral provisions of Section 9.5.

      (c) ESOP Contributions. If a portion of a Participant's ESOP Account is
forfeited, Stock allocated to said Participant's ESOP Stock Account shall be
forfeited only after other assets are forfeited. If interests in more than one
class of Stock have been allocated to a Participant's ESOP Stock Account, the
Participant must be treated as forfeiting the same proportion of each class of
Stock. A forfeiture shall be charged to the Participant's ESOP Account as of the
first day of the first Valuation Period in which the forfeiture becomes certain
pursuant to Section 9.5. Except as otherwise provided in that Section, a
forfeiture shall be added to the contributions of the terminated Participant's
Employer which are to be credited to other Participants pursuant to Section 4.4
as of the last day of the Plan Year in which the forfeiture becomes certain.

      9.7 Vesting and Nonforfeitability. A Participant's interest in his Account
which has become vested shall be nonforfeitable for any reason.

Section 10. Payment of Benefits.

      10.1 Benefits for Participants. For a Participant whose Service ends for
any reason, distribution will be made to or for the benefit of the Participant
or, in the case of the Participant's death, his Beneficiary, by either, or a
combination of the following methods:

            10.1-1 By payment in a lump sum, in accordance with Section 10.2; or


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

            10.1-2 By payment in a series of substantially equal annual
      installments over a period not to exceed five (5) years, provided the
      maximum period over which the distribution of a Participant's Account may
      be made shall be extended by 1 year, up to five (5) additional years, for
      each $140,000 (or fraction thereof) by which such Participant's Account
      balance exceeds $710,000 (the aforementioned figures are subject to
      cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury
      pursuant to Section 409(o)(2) of the Code).

      The Participant shall elect the manner in which his vested Account balance
will be distributed to him. If a Participant so desires, he may direct how his
benefits are to be paid to his Beneficiary. If a deceased Participant did not
file a direction with the Committee, the Participant's benefits shall be
distributed to his Beneficiary in a lump sum. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary, if the value of a Participant's vested Account balance, at the
time of any distribution, does not equal or exceed $3,500 ($5,000 for Plan Years
beginning after August 5, 1997), then such Participant's vested Account shall be
distributed in a lump sum within 60 days after the end of the Plan Year in which
employment terminates. If the value of a Participant's vested Account balance
is, or has ever been, in excess of $3,500 ($5,000 for Plan Years beginning after
August 5, 1997), then his benefits shall not be paid prior to the later of the
time he has attained Normal Retirement or age 62 unless he elects an early
payment date in a written election filed with the Committee. A Participant may
modify such an election at any time, provided any new benefit payment date is at
least 30 days after a modified election is delivered to the Committee, subject
to the provisions of Section 10.12 hereof.

      10.2 Time for Distribution.

            10.2-1 If the Participant, and, if applicable, with the consent of
      the Participant's spouse, elects the distribution of the Participant's
      Account balance in the Plan, distribution shall commence not later than
      one year after the close of the Plan Year:

                  (i) in which the Participant separates from Service by reason
            of attainment of his Normal Retirement Date under the Plan,
            Disability, or death; or

                  (ii) which is the fifth Plan Year following the year in which
            the Participant resigns or is dismissed, unless he is reemployed
            before such date.

            10.2-2 Unless the Participant elects otherwise, the distribution of
      the balance of a Participant's Account shall commence not later than the
      60th day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which -

                  (i) the Participant attains the age of 65;

                  (ii) occurs the tenth anniversary of the year in which the
            Participant commenced participation in the Plan; or

                  (iii) the Participant terminates his Service with the
            Employer.

            10.2-3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 10.2 to
      the contrary, (1) with respect to a five percent owner (as defined in Code
      Section 416), distribution of a Participant's Account shall commence
      (whether or not he remains in the employ of the Employer) not later than
      the April 1 of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which
      the Participant attains age 70-1/2, and (2) with respect to all other
      Participants, payment of a Participant's benefit will commence no later
      than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

      Participant attains age 70-1/2, or, if later, the year in which the
      Participant retires. A Participant's benefit from that portion of his
      Account committed to the Investment Fund shall be calculated on the basis
      of the most recent Valuation Date before the date of payment.

            10.2-4 Distribution of a Participant's Account balance after his
      death shall comply with the following requirements:

                  (i) If a Participant dies before his distributions have
            commenced, distribution of his Account to his Beneficiary shall
            commence not later than one year after the end of the Plan Year in
            which the Participant died; however, if the Participant's
            Beneficiary is his surviving Spouse, distributions may commence on
            the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2. In
            either case, distributions shall be completed within five years
            after they commence.

                  (ii) If the Participant dies after distribution has commenced
            pursuant to Section 10.1-2 but before his entire interest in the
            Plan has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of that
            interest shall, in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, be
            distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution
            being used under Section 10.1-2 at the date of his death.

                  (iii) If a married Participant dies before his benefit
            payments begin, then unless he has specifically elected otherwise
            the Committee shall cause the balance in his Account to be paid to
            his Spouse. No election by a married Participant of a different
            Beneficiary shall be valid unless the election is accompanied by the
            Spouse's written consent, which (i) must acknowledge the effect of
            the election, (ii) must explicitly provide either that the
            designated Beneficiary may not subsequently be changed by the
            Participant without the Spouse's further consent, or that it may be
            changed without such consent, and (iii) must be witnessed by the
            Committee, its representative, or a notary public. (This requirement
            shall not apply if the Participant establishes to the Committee's
            satisfaction that the Spouse may not be located.)

      10.3 Marital Status. The Committee shall from time to time take whatever
steps it deems appropriate to keep informed of each Participant's marital
status. Each Employer shall provide the Committee with the most reliable
information in the Employer's possession regarding its Participants' marital
status, and the Committee may, in its discretion, require a notarized affidavit
from any Participant as to his marital status. The Committee, the Plan, the
Trustee, and the Employers shall be fully protected and discharged from any
liability to the extent of any benefit payments made as a result of the
Committee's good faith and reasonable reliance upon information obtained from a
Participant and his Employer as to his marital status.

      10.4 Delay in Benefit Determination. If the Committee is unable to
determine the benefits payable to a Participant or Beneficiary on or before the
latest date prescribed for payment pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2, the
benefits shall in any event be paid within 60 days after they can first be
determined, with whatever makeup payments may be appropriate in view of the
delay.

      10.5 Accounting for Benefit Payments. Any benefit payment shall be charged
to the Participant's Account as of the first day of the Valuation Period in
which the payment is made.

      10.6 Options to Receive and Sell Stock. Unless ownership of virtually all
Stock is restricted to active Employees and qualified retirement plans for the
benefit of Employees pursuant to the certificates of incorporation or by-laws of
the Employers issuing Stock, a terminated Participant or the


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Beneficiary of a deceased Participant may instruct the Committee to distribute
the Participant's entire vested interest in his ESOP Account in the form of
Stock or partially in cash and partially in shares of Stock; provided, further
that the Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute cash in lieu of
fractional shares. If cash is to be distributed in lieu of shares of Stock, the
Trustee may either sell such shares at their fair market value and distribute
the cash proceeds (net of selling expenses) or utilize cash already held in the
Trust. If the Trustee utilizes cash already held in the Trust, the Trustee shall
select the date on which the fair market value of Stock shall be determined.
Such date shall be selected on a uniform basis for all Participants.

      Any Participant who receives Stock pursuant to Section 10.1, and any
person who has received Stock from the Plan or from such a Participant by reason
of the Participant's death or incompetency, by reason of divorce or separation
from the Participant, or by reason of a rollover contribution described in
Section 402(a)(5) of the Code, shall have the right to require the Employer
which issued the Stock to purchase the Stock for its current fair market value
(hereinafter referred to as the "put right"). The put right shall be exercisable
by written notice to the Committee during the first 60 days after the Stock is
distributed by the Plan, and, if not exercised in that period, during the first
60 days in the following Plan Year after the Committee has communicated to the
Participant its determination as to the Stock's current fair market value.
However, the put right shall not apply to the extent that the Stock, at the time
the put right would otherwise be exercisable, may be sold on an established
market in accordance with federal and state securities laws and regulations.
Similarly, the put right shall not apply with respect to the portion of a
Participant's Account which the Participant elected to have reinvested under
Code Section 401(a)(28)(B). If the put right is exercised, the Trustee may, if
so directed by the Committee in its sole discretion, assume the Employer's
rights and obligations with respect to purchasing the Stock. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in the case of a plan established by a Bank (as
defined in Code Section 581), the put right shall not apply if prohibited by a
federal or state law and Participants are entitled to elect that their benefits
be distributed in cash.

      If a Participant elects to receive his distribution in the form of a lump
sum pursuant to Section 10.1-1 of the Plan, the Employer or the Trustee, as the
case may be, may elect to pay for the Stock in equal periodic installments, not
less frequently than annually, over a period not longer than five years from the
day after the put right is exercised, with adequate security and interest at a
reasonable rate on the unpaid balance, all such terms to be set forth in a
promissory note delivered to the seller with normal terms as to acceleration
upon any uncured default.

      If a Participant elects to receive his distribution in the form of an
installment payment pursuant to Section 10.1-2 of the Plan, the Employer or the
Trustee, as the case may be, shall pay for the Stock distributed in the
installment distribution over a period which shall not exceed 30 days after the
exercise of the put right.

      Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate any Employer to
register any Stock under any federal or state securities law or to create or
maintain a public market to facilitate the transfer or disposition of any Stock.
The put right described herein may only be exercised by a person described in
the second preceding paragraph, and may not be transferred with any Stock to any
other person. As to all Stock purchased by the Plan in exchange for any Stock
Obligation, the put right shall be nonterminable. The put right for Stock
acquired through a Stock Obligation shall continue with respect to such Stock
after the Stock Obligation is repaid or the Plan ceases to be an employee stock
ownership plan.

      10.7 Restrictions on Disposition of Stock. Except in the case of Stock
which is traded on an established market, a Participant who receives Stock
pursuant to Section 10.1, and any person who has received Stock from the Plan or
from such a Participant by reason of the Participant's death or incompetency, by
reason of divorce or separation from the Participant, or by reason of a rollover


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

contribution described in Section 402(a)(5) of the Code, shall, prior to any
sale or other transfer of the Stock to any other person, first offer the Stock
to the issuing Employer and to the Plan at the greater of (i) its current fair
market value, or (ii) the purchase price offered in good faith by an independent
third party purchaser. This restriction shall apply to any transfer, whether
voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of law, and whether for consideration or
gratuitous. Either the Employer or the Trustee may accept the offer within 14
days after it is delivered. Any Stock distributed by the Plan shall bear a
conspicuous legend describing the right of first refusal under this Section
10.7, as well as any other restrictions upon the transfer of the Stock imposed
by federal and state securities laws and regulations.

      10.8 Continuing Loan Provisions; Creations of Protections and Rights .
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 10.6 and 10.7 and this Section, no
shares of Employer Stock held or distributed by the Trustee may be subject to a
put, call or other option, or buy-sell arrangement. The provisions of this
Section shall continue to by applicable to such Stock even if the Plan ceases to
be an employee stock ownership plan under Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

      10.9 Direct Rollover of Eligible Distribution . A Participant or
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Trustee
or the Committee, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the Participant or
distributee in a direct rollover.

            10.9-1 An "eligible rollover" is any distribution that does not
      include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
      periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life
      (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
      expectancies) of the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, or for
      a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent
      such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); a hardship
      distribution described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code; and the
      portion of any distribution that is not included in gross income
      (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
      appreciation with respect to employer securities).

            10.9-2 An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
      account described in Code Section 401(a), an individual retirement annuity
      described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
      Section 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a),
      that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in
      the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving Spouse, an
      eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual
      retirement annuity.

            Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, for
      purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section 10.9-2 of the Plan,
      an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described
      in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of
      the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state,
      or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a
      state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
      such plan form this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall
      also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a
      spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
      domestic relation order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.

            10.9-3 A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible
      retirement plan specified by the distributee.


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

            10.9-4 The term "distributee" shall refer to a deceased
      Participant's Spouse or a Participant's former Spouse who is the alternate
      payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code
      Section 414(p).

      10.10 Withdrawals During Employment.

      (a) Upon written notice to the Committee at least 30 days (or such shorter
period as the Committee allows) prior to a Valuation Date, a Participant may at
any time during his employment with the Company withdraw all or any portion of
the vested amount standing to the credit of the Participant's Discretionary
Contribution Account, Elective Deferral Account, Qualified Non-Elective
Contribution Account, Matching Contribution Account, Qualified Matching
Contribution Account or Rollover Account, but only in order, and to the extent
necessary, to meet a "Financial Hardship" and to pay the amount of any taxes
reasonably anticipated to result from such withdrawal. The determination that
the Participant is faced with a Financial Hardship and of the amount required to
meet such Financial Hardship which is not reasonably available from other
resources of the Participant shall be made by the Administrator in accordance
with uniform and nondiscriminatory standards and policies which shall be adopted
by the Administrator and consistently applied to each application for a
withdrawal pursuant to this Section 10.10. For purposes of this Section 10.10,
"Financial Hardship" shall mean an immediate and heavy financial need which such
Participant is not able to meet from any other reasonably available resources.
Subject to the foregoing and the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code and
any regulations thereunder, the term "Financial Hardship" shall mean and include
the following:

            (i) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal
      residence of the Participant;

            (ii) the payment of the tuition for the next twelve months of
      post-secondary education for the Participant, his Spouse, children, or
      dependents;

            (iii) the payment of medical expenses described in Section 213(d) of
      the Code which are incurred by the Participant, his Spouse or any
      dependent, and which are not covered by insurance; or

            (iv) the need to prevent an eviction or mortgage foreclosure on the
      Participant's principal residence.

      If a Participant has an immediate and heavy financial need as described
above, he may receive a hardship withdrawal not in excess of the amount of the
immediate and heavy financial need (including amounts necessary to pay any
federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to
result from the distribution) provided the Committee determines that such
Participant is not able to meet such need from any other reasonably available
resources. In determining that such Participant is not able to meet such
Financial Hardship from any other sources, the Committee may reasonably rely
upon the written certification of the Participant given in accordance with the
regulations under Section 401(k) of the Code.

      (b) The Committee may authorize a hardship distribution to a Participant
only after the Participant has obtained all distributions, other than hardship
distributions, and all nontaxable loans currently available under all plans
maintained by the Employer.

      (c) A Participant may specify that a withdrawal under this Section 10.10
is to be charged to his interest in one or more specific Investment Funds in
which the Account charged with the withdrawal is invested. Unless so specified,
distribution will be made out of the interests of such Account in each
Investment Fund in accordance with the proportion which the interest of such
Account in such Investment


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Fund bears to the total value of such account, subject however to such
restrictions as may be applicable to the particular Investment Funds.

      (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who has attained age
59-1/2 may withdraw a cash amount equal to all or a specified portion of his
vested Accounts without the need to seek the consent of the Committee.

      (e) All withdrawals under this Section 10.10 shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Valuation Date next following timely receipt by the
Committee of the Participant's written notice.

      (f) The Participant's Elective Deferrals and Participant Voluntary
Nondeductible Contributions will be suspended for at least 12 months after
receipt of the hardship distribution in this Plan and all other plans maintained
by the Employer.

      (g) If the distribution is made from any Account other than the Elective
Deferral Account, a distribution due to hardship may be made without application
of Section 10.10(f).

      (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to termination of employment,
each Participant with a Rollover Contributions Account may elect to withdraw, as
of the Valuation Date next following receipt of an election by the Committee,
and upon such notice as the Committee may require, all or any such Account, as
of such Valuation Date.

      10.11 Participant Loans. Upon written application of a Participant, the
Committee may direct the Trustee to lend to the Participant such amount or
amounts as the Committee may determine, provided that the aggregate amount of
all outstanding loans to the Participant from this Plan and from any other
qualified plan maintained by the Employer or any affiliated Employer, including
accrued interest thereon, shall not exceed the lesser of (a) $50,000, reduced by
any loan repayment made during the one (1) year period ending on the day before
the date such loan is made, and (b) fifty percent (50%) of such Participant's
vested Discretionary Contribution Account, Elective Deferral Account, Qualified
Non-Elective Contribution Account, Matching Contribution Account, Qualified
Matching Contribution Account or Rollover Account balances, from which the
borrowing is made, determined at the time the loan is made. The Participant's
request must be made in writing to the Committee and must specify the amount
requested, the reason for the loan and such additional information as the
Committee shall require.

      Loans shall be made available to Participants on a reasonably equivalent
basis in accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory standards and policies,
which shall be consistently applied to each application for a loan pursuant to
this Section 10.11.

      Each such loan shall be made at a reasonable interest rate determined by
the Committee from time to time, shall be amortized in substantially level
payments made not less than quarterly over the term of the loan and shall be
subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem proper.
Each loan shall be evidenced by the promissory note of the Participant and shall
be adequately secured. Such loan shall be secured by fifty percent (50%) of the
aggregate of the Participant's vested Account balances from which the borrowing
is made. In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of
security may be made by the Trustee. Each such loan shall be repaid within five
(5) years unless such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which within a
reasonable time is to be used (determined at the time such loan is made) as the
principal residence of the Participant.

      Each loan made hereunder shall be deemed to be a separate investment and
shall be credited to a separate loan account for the benefit of the borrowing
Participant. All payments of interest and principal shall be through payroll
deduction and shall be credited to such Participant's loan account, and such


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

account shall be adjusted for any applicable administrative expenses. In
connection with the making of the loan, the Committee shall direct the Trustee
to reduce the investment by the borrowing Participant's Accounts in the
Investment Funds pursuant to the written direction of the Participant. The
Trustee shall reinvest payments on the loan as soon as practicable in accordance
with the most recent investment election filed by the Participant pursuant to
Section 4.11.

      If any part of all of the amount standing to the Discretionary
Contribution Account, Elective Deferral Account, Qualified Non-Elective
Contribution Account, Matching Contribution Account, Qualified Matching
Contribution Account or Rollover Account of a Participant shall become
distributable to such Participant or his Beneficiary while a loan to such
Participant under this Section 10.11 is outstanding, the Trustee shall apply the
amount of such distribution in payment of any outstanding loan principal,
whether or not then due, and any interest theretofore accrued, before
distributing the balance, if any, to the Participant or his Beneficiary.

      10.12 Waiver of 30-Day Period. If a distribution is one to which Sections
401(a)(11) and 417 of the Code do not apply, such distribution may commence less
than 30 days after the notice required under Section 411(a)-11(c) of the Income
Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

            (i) the Trustee or Committee, as applicable, clearly informs the
      Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least 30
      days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not
      to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular option), and

            (ii) the Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively
      elects a distribution.

Section 11. Rules Governing Benefit Claims and Review of Appeals.

      11.1 Claim for Benefits. Any Participant or Beneficiary who qualifies for
the payment of benefits shall file a claim for his benefits with the Committee
on a form provided by the Committee. The claim, including any election of an
alternative benefit form, shall be filed at least 30 days before the date on
which the benefits are to begin. If a Participant or Beneficiary fails to file a
claim by the day before the date on which benefits become payable, he shall be
presumed to have filed a claim for payment for the Participant's benefits in the
standard form prescribed by Sections 10.1 or 10.2

      11.2 Notification by Committee. Within 90 days after receiving a claim for
benefits (or within 180 days, if special circumstances require an extension of
time and written notice of the extension is given to the Participant or
Beneficiary within 90 days after receiving the claim for benefits), the
Committee shall notify the Participant or Beneficiary whether the claim has been
approved or denied. If the Committee denies a claim in any respect, the
Committee shall set forth in a written notice to the Participant or Beneficiary:

            (i) each specific reason for the denial;

            (ii) specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which
      the denial is based;

            (iii) a description of any additional material or information which
      could be submitted by the Participant or Beneficiary to support his claim,
      with an explanation of the relevance of such information; and

            (iv) an explanation of the claims review procedures set forth in
      Section 11.3.


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

      11.3 Claims Review Procedure. Within 60 days after a Participant or
Beneficiary receives notice from the Committee that his claim for benefits has
been denied in any respect, he may file with the Committee a written notice of
appeal setting forth his reasons for disputing the Committee's determination. In
connection with his appeal the Participant or Beneficiary or his representative
may inspect or purchase copies of pertinent documents and records to the extent
not inconsistent with other Participants' and Beneficiaries' rights of privacy.
Within 60 days after receiving a notice of appeal from a prior determination (or
within 120 days, if special circumstances require an extension of time and
written notice of the extension is given to the Participant or Beneficiary and
his representative within 60 days after receiving the notice of appeal), the
Committee shall furnish to the Participant or Beneficiary and his
representative, if any, a written statement of the Committee's final decision
with respect to his claim, including the reasons for such decision and the
particular Plan provisions upon which it is based.

Section 12. The Committee and Its Functions.

      12.1 Authority of Committee. The Committee shall be the "plan
administrator" within the meaning of ERISA and shall have exclusive
responsibility and authority to control and manage the operation and
administration of the Plan, including the interpretation and application of its
provisions, except to the extent such responsibility and authority are otherwise
specifically (i) allocated to the Bank, the Employers, or the Trustee under the
Plan and Trust Agreement, (ii) delegated in writing to other persons by the
Bank, the Employers, the Committee, or the Trustee, or (iii) allocated to other
parties by operation of law. The Committee shall have exclusive responsibility
regarding decisions concerning the payment of benefits under the Plan. The
Committee shall have no investment responsibility with respect to the Investment
Fund except to the extent, if any, specifically provided in the Trust Agreement.
In the discharge of its duties, the Committee may employ accountants, actuaries,
legal counsel, and other agents (who also may be employed by an Employer or the
Trustee in the same or some other capacity) and may pay their reasonable
expenses and compensation.

      12.2 Identity of Committee. The Committee shall consists of three or more
individuals selected by the Bank. Any individual, including a director, trustee,
shareholder, officer, or Employee of an Employer, shall be eligible to serve as
a member of the Committee. The Bank shall have the power to remove any
individual serving on the Committee at any time without cause upon 10 days
written notice, and any individual may resign from the Committee at any time
upon 10 days written notice to the Bank. The Bank shall notify the Trustee of
any change in membership of the Committee.

      12.3 Duties of Committee. The Committee shall keep whatever records may be
necessary to implement the Plan and shall furnish whatever reports may be
required from time to time by the Bank. The Committee shall furnish to the
Trustee whatever information may be necessary to properly administer the Trust.
The Committee shall see to the filing with the appropriate government agencies
of all reports and returns required of the plan Committee under ERISA and other
laws.

      Further, the Committee shall have exclusive responsibility and authority
with respect to the Plan's holdings of Stock and shall direct the Trustee in all
respects regarding the purchase, retention, sale, exchange, and pledge of Stock
and the creation and satisfaction of Stock Obligations. Subject to the direction
of the Board as to the application of Employer contributions to Stock
Obligations, and subject to the provisions of Sections 6.4 and 10.6 as to
Participants' rights under certain circumstances to have their Accounts invested
in Stock or in assets other than Stock, the Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion the extent to which assets of the Trust shall be used to repay
Stock Obligations, to purchase Stock, or to invest in other assets to be
selected by the Trustee or an investment manager. No provision of the Plan
relating to the allocation or vesting of any interests in the Stock Fund or the
Investment Fund shall restrict the Committee from changing any holdings of the
Trust, whether the changes involve an increase or a decrease in the Stock or
other assets credited to Participants' Accounts. In determining the


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

proper extent of the Trust's investment in Stock, the Committee shall be
authorized to employ investment counsel, legal counsel, appraisers, and other
agents to pay their reasonable expenses and compensation.

      12.4 Valuation of Stock. If the valuation of any Stock is not established
by reported trading on a generally recognized public market, the Committee shall
have the exclusive authority and responsibility to determine its value for all
purposes under the Plan. Such value shall be determined as of each Valuation
Date, and on any other date as of which the Plan purchases or sells such Stock.
The Committee shall use generally accepted methods of valuing stock of similar
corporations for purposes of arm's length business and investment transactions,
and in this connection the Committee shall obtain, and shall be protected in
relying upon, the valuation of such Stock as determined by an independent
appraiser experienced in preparing valuations of similar businesses.

      12.5 Compliance with ERISA. The Committee shall perform all acts necessary
to comply with ERISA. Each individual member or employee of the Committee shall
discharge his duties in good faith and in accordance with the applicable
requirements of ERISA.

      12.6 Action by Committee. All actions of the Committee shall be governed
by the affirmative vote of a number of members which is a majority of the total
number of members currently appointed, including vacancies. The members of the
Committee may meet informally and may take any action without meeting as a
group.

      12.7 Execution of Documents. Any instrument executed by the Committee
shall be signed by any member or employee of the Committee.

      12.8 Adoption of Rules. The Committee shall adopt such rules and
regulations of uniform applicability as it deems necessary or appropriate for
the proper administration and interpretation of the Plan.

      12.9 Responsibilities to Participants. The Committee shall determine which
Employees qualify to enter the Plan. The Committee shall furnish to each
eligible Employee whatever summary plan descriptions, summary annual reports,
and other notices and information may be required under ERISA. The Committee
also shall determine when a Participant or his Beneficiary qualifies for the
payment of benefits under the Plan. The Committee shall furnish to each such
Participant or Beneficiary whatever information is required under ERISA (or is
otherwise appropriate) to enable the Participant or Beneficiary to make whatever
elections may be available pursuant to Sections 6 and 10, and the Committee
shall provide for the payment of benefits in the proper form and amount from the
assets of the Trust Fund. The Committee may decide in its sole discretion to
permit modifications of elections and to defer or accelerate benefits to the
extent consistent with applicable law and the best interests of the individuals
concerned.

      12.10 Alternative Payees in Event of Incapacity. If the Committee finds at
any time that an individual qualifying for benefits under this Plan is a minor
or is incompetent, the Committee may direct the benefits to be paid, in the case
of a minor, to his parents, his legal guardian, or a custodian for him under the
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or, in the case of an incompetent, to his spouse,
or his legal guardian, the payments to be used for the individual's benefit. The
Committee and the Trustee shall not be obligated to inquire as to the actual use
of the funds by the person receiving them under this Section 12.10, and any such
payment shall completely discharge the obligations of the Plan, the Trustee, the
Committee, and the Employers to the extent of the payment.

      12.11 Indemnification by Employers. Except as separately agreed in
writing, the Committee, and any member or employee of the Committee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Employer, jointly and severally, to the
fullest extent permitted by law against any and all costs, damages, expenses,


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

and liabilities reasonably incurred by or imposed upon it or him in connection
with any claim made against it or him or in which it or he may be involved by
reason of its or his being, or having been, the Committee, or a member or
employee of the Committee, to the extent such amounts are not paid by insurance.

      12.12 Nonparticipation by Interested Member. Any member of the Committee
who also is a Participant in the Plan shall take no part in any determination
specifically relating to his own participation or benefits, unless his
abstention would leave the Committee incapable of acting on the matter.

Section 13. Adoption, Amendment, or Termination of the Plan.

      13.1 Adoption of Plan by Other Employers. With the consent of the Bank,
any entity may become a participating Employer under the Plan by (i) taking such
action as shall be necessary to adopt the Plan, (ii) becoming a party to the
Trust Agreement establishing the Trust Fund, and (iii) executing and delivering
such instruments and taking such other action as may be necessary or desirable
to put the Plan into effect with respect to the entity's Employees.

      13.2 Adoption of Plan by Successor. In the event that any Employer shall
be reorganized by way of merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or otherwise,
so that an entity other than an Employer shall succeed to all or substantially
all of the Employer's business, the successor entity may be substituted for the
Employer under the Plan by adopting the Plan and becoming a party to the Trust
Agreement. Contributions by the Employer shall be automatically suspended from
the effective date of any such reorganization until the date upon which the
substitution of the successor entity for the Employer under the Plan becomes
effective. If, within 90 days following the effective date of any such
reorganization, the successor entity shall not have elected to become a party to
the Plan, or if the Employer shall adopt a plan of complete liquidation other
than in connection with a reorganization, the Plan shall be automatically
terminated with respect to Employees of the Employer as of the close of business
on the 90th day following the effective date of the reorganization, or as of the
close of business on the date of adoption of a plan of complete liquidation, as
the case may be.

      13.3 Plan Adoption Subject to Qualification. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan, the adoption of the Plan and the execution of the Trust
Agreement are conditioned upon their being determined initially by the Internal
Revenue Service to meet the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the
Code, so that the Employers may deduct currently for federal income tax purposes
their contributions to the Trust and so that the Participants may exclude the
contributions from their gross income and recognize income only when they
receive benefits. In the event that this Plan is held by the Internal Revenue
Service not to qualify initially under Section 401(a), the Plan may be amended
retroactively to the earliest date permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulations in
order to secure qualification under Section 401(a). If this Plan is held by the
Internal Revenue Service not to qualify initially under Section 401(a) either as
originally adopted or as amended, each Employer's contributions to the Trust
under this Plan (including any earnings thereon) shall be returned to it and
this Plan shall be terminated. In the event that this Plan is amended after its
initial qualification and the Plan as amended is held by the Internal Revenue
Service not to qualify under Section 401(a), the amendment may be modified
retroactively to the earliest date permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulations in
order to secure approval of the amendment under Section 401(a).

      13.4 Right to Amend or Terminate. The Bank intends to continue this Plan
as a permanent program. However, each participating Employer separately reserves
the right to suspend, supersede, or terminate the Plan at any time and for any
reason, as it applies to that Employer's Employees, and the Bank reserves the
right to amend, suspend, supersede, merge, consolidate, or terminate the Plan at
any time and for any reason, as it applies to the Employees of each Employer. No
amendment, suspension,


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

supersession, merger, consolidation, or termination of the Plan shall (i) reduce
any Participant's or Beneficiary's proportionate interest in the Trust Fund,
(ii) reduce or restrict, either directly or indirectly, the benefit provided any
Participant prior to the amendment, or (iii) divert any portion of the Trust
Fund to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their
Beneficiaries prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan.
Moreover, there shall not be any transfer of assets to a successor plan or
merger or consolidation with another plan unless, in the event of the
termination of the successor plan or the surviving plan immediately following
such transfer, merger, or consolidation, each participant or beneficiary would
be entitled to a benefit equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been
entitled to if the plan in which he was previously a participant or beneficiary
had terminated immediately prior to such transfer, merger, or consolidation.
Following a termination of this Plan by the Bank, the Trustee shall continue to
administer the Trust and pay benefits in accordance with the Plan as amended
from time to time and the Committee's instructions.

      If any amendment changes the vesting schedule, including an automatic
change to or from a top-heavy vesting schedule, any Participant with three (3)
or more Vesting Years may, by filing a written request with the Employer, elect
to have his vested percentage computed under the vesting schedule in effect
prior to the amendment. The election period must begin not later than the later
of sixty (60) days after the amendment is adopted, the amendment becomes
effective, or the Participant is issued written notice of the amendment by the
Employer or the Committee.

Section 14. Miscellaneous Provisions.

      14.1 Plan Creates No Employment Rights. Nothing in this Plan shall be
interpreted as giving any Employee the right to be retained as an Employee by an
Employer, or as limiting or affecting the rights of an Employer to control its
Employees or to terminate the Service of any Employee at any time and for any
reason, subject to any applicable employment or collective bargaining
agreements.

      14.2 Nonassignability of Benefits. No assignment, pledge, or other
anticipation of benefits from the Plan will be permitted or recognized by the
Employer, the Committee, or the Trustee. Moreover, benefits from the Plan shall
not be subject to attachment, garnishment, or other legal process for debts or
liabilities of any Participant or Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law.
This prohibition on assignment or alienation shall apply to any judgment,
decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which
relates to the provision of child support, alimony, or property rights to a
present or former Spouse, child or other dependent of a Participant pursuant to
a state domestic relations or community property law, unless the judgment,
decree, or order is determined by the Committee to be a qualified domestic
relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code, as more fully
set forth in Section 14.12 hereof.

      14.3 Limit of Employer Liability. The liability of the Employer with
respect to Participants under this Plan shall be limited to making contributions
to the Trust from time to time, in accordance with Section 4.

      14.4 Treatment of Expenses . All expenses incurred by the Committee and
the Trustee in connection with administering this Plan and Trust Fund shall be
paid by the Trustee from the Trust Fund to the extent the expenses have not been
paid or assumed by the Employer or by the Trustee.

      14.5 Number and Gender. Any use of the singular shall be interpreted to
include the plural, and the plural the singular. Any use of the masculine,
feminine, or neuter shall be interpreted to include the masculine, feminine, or
neuter, as the context shall require.


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

      14.6 Nondiversion of Assets. Except as provided in Sections 5.8 and 13.3,
under no circumstances shall any portion of the Trust Fund be diverted to or
used for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants and
their Beneficiaries prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan.

      14.7 Separability of Provisions. If any provision of this Plan is held to
be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Plan shall not be
affected but shall be applied as if the invalid or unenforceable provision had
not been included in the Plan.

      14.8 Service of Process. The agent for the service of process upon the
Plan shall be the president of the Bank, or such other person as may be
designated from time to time by the Bank.

      14.9 Governing State Law. This Plan shall be interpreted in accordance
with the laws of the State of Arkansas to the extent those laws are applicable
under the provisions of ERISA.

      14.10 Employer Contributions Conditioned on Deductibility. Employer
Contributions to the Plan are conditioned on deductibility under Code Section
404. In the event that the Internal Revenue Service shall determine that all or
any portion of an Employer Contribution is not deductible under that Section,
the nondeductible portion shall be returned to the Employer within one year of
the disallowance of the deduction.

      14.11 Unclaimed Accounts. Neither the Employer nor the Trustees shall be
under any obligation to search for, or ascertain the whereabouts of, any
Participant or Beneficiary. The Employer or the Trustees, by certified or
registered mail addressed to his last known address of record with the Employer,
shall notify any Participant or Beneficiary that he is entitled to a
distribution under this Plan, and the notice shall quote the provisions of this
Section. If the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim his benefits or make
his whereabouts known in writing to the Employer or the Trustees within seven
(7) calendar years after the date of notification, the benefits of the
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan will be disposed of as follows:

            (a)   If the whereabouts of the Participant is unknown but the
                  whereabouts of the Participant's Beneficiary is known to the
                  Trustees, distribution will be made to the Beneficiary.

            (b)   If the whereabouts of the Participant and his Beneficiary are
                  unknown to the Trustees, the Plan will forfeit the benefit,
                  provided that the benefit is subject to a claim for
                  reinstatement if the Participant or Beneficiary make a claim
                  for the forfeited benefit.

      Any payment made pursuant to the power herein conferred upon the Trustees
shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations of the Trustees, to the
extent of the distributions so made.

      14.12 Qualified Domestic Relations Order. Section 14.2 shall not apply to
a "qualified domestic relations order" defined in Code Section 414(p), and such
other domestic relations orders permitted to be so treated by Administrator
under the provisions of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984. Further, to the
extent provided under a "qualified domestic relations order," a former Spouse of
a Participant shall be treated as the Spouse or surviving Spouse for all
purposes under the Plan.

In the case of any domestic relations order received by the Plan:

      (a) The Employer or the Plan Committee shall promptly notify the
Participant and any other alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the
Plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations
orders, and


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

      (b) Within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the Employer
or the Plan Committee shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic
relations order and notify the Participant and each alternate payee of such
determination. The Employer or the Plan Committee shall establish reasonable
procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to
administer distributions under such qualified orders.

      During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order
is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the Employer or
Plan Committee, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the
Employer or the Plan Committee shall segregate in a separate account in the Plan
or in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to the
alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a
qualified domestic relations order. If within eighteen (18) months the order (or
modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order,
the Employer or the Plan Committee shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any
interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto. If within eighteen
(18) months it is determined that the o'er is not a qualified domestic relations
order, or the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations
order is not resolved, then the Employer or the Plan Committee shall pay the
segregated amounts (plus any interest thereon) to the person or persons who
would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order. Any
determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is
made after the close of the eighteen (18) month period shall be applied
prospectively only. The term "alternate payee" means any Spouse, former spouse,
child or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a domestic
relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefit
payable under a Plan with respect to such Participant.

Section 15. Top-Heavy Provisions.

      15.1 Top-Heavy Plan. For any Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1983,
this Plan is top-heavy if any of the following conditions exist:

      (a) If the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds sixty percent (60%) and
this Plan is not part of any required aggregation group or permissive
aggregation group;

      (b) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group (but is not
part of a permissive aggregation group) and the aggregate top-heavy ratio for
the group of Plans exceeds sixty percent (60%); or

      (c) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group and part of a
permissive aggregation group and the aggregate top-heavy ratio for the
permissive aggregation group exceeds sixty percent (60%).

      15.2 Super Top-Heavy Plan. For any Plan Year beginning after December 31,
1983, this Plan will be a super top-heavy Plan if any of the following
conditions exist:

      (a) If the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds ninety percent (90%) and
this Plan is not part of any required aggregation group or permissive
aggregation group.

      (b) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group (but is not
part of a permissive aggregation group) and the aggregate top-heavy ratio for
the group of Plans exceeds ninety percent (90%), or


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

      (c) If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group and part of a
permissive aggregation group and the aggregate top-heavy ratio for the
permissive aggregation group exceeds ninety percent (90%).

      15.3 Definitions.

      In making this determination, the Committee shall use the following
definitions and principles:

            15.3-1 The "Determination Date", with respect to the first Plan Year
      of any plan, means the last day of that Plan Year, and with respect to
      each subsequent Plan Year, means the last day of the preceding Plan Year.
      If any other plan has a Determination Date which differs from this Plan's
      Determination Date, the top-heaviness of this Plan shall be determined on
      the basis of the other plan's Determination Date falling within the same
      calendar years as this Plan's Determination Date.

            15.3-2 A "Key Employee," with respect to a Plan Year, means an
      Employee who at any time during the five years ending on the top-heavy
      Determination Date for the Plan Year has received compensation from an
      Employer and has been (i) an officer of the Employer having 415
      Compensation greater than 50 percent of the limit then in effect under
      Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code, (ii) one of the 10 Employees owning the
      largest interests in the Employer having 415 Compensation greater than the
      limit then in effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A), (iii) an owner of more
      than five percent of the outstanding equity interest or the outstanding
      voting interest in any Employer, or (iv) an owner of more than one percent
      of the outstanding equity interest or the outstanding voting interest in
      an Employer whose annual compensation exceeds $150,000. For Plan Years
      commencing on or after January 1, 2001, a "Key Employee" means any
      Employee or former Employee (including any deceased Employee) who at any
      time during the Plan Year that includes the Determination Date was an
      officer of the Employer having annual compensation greater than $130,000
      (as adjusted under section 416(i)(1) of the Code for Plan Years beginning
      after December 31, 2002), a five percent owner of the Employer, or a
      one-percent owner of the Employer having annual compensation of more than
      $150,000. The determination of who is a key employee will be made in
      accordance with section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable
      regulations and other gudance of general applicability issued hereunder.
      For purposes of determining which individuals are Key Employees, annual
      compensation means compensation as defined in Section 415(c)(3) of the
      Code, but including amounts contributed by the Employer pursuant to an
      Elective Deferral Agreement which are excludible from the Employee's gross
      income under Code Section 125, Code Section 402(a)(8), Code Section 402(h)
      or Code Section 403(b), and for Plan Years commencing on or after January
      1, 2001, under Section 132(f)(4) of the Code. The Beneficiary of a Key
      Employee shall also be considered a Key Employee.

            15.3-3 A "Non-key Employee" means an Employee who at any time during
      the five years ending on the top-heavy Determination Date for the Plan
      Year has received compensation from an Employer and who has never been a
      Key Employee, and the Beneficiary of any such Employee.

            15.3-4 A "required aggregation group" includes (a) each qualified
      Plan of the Employer in which at least one Key Employee participates in
      the Plan Year containing the Determination Date and any of the four (4)
      preceding Plan Years, and (b) any other qualified Plan of the Employer
      which enables a Plan described in (a) to meet the requirements of Code
      Sections 401(a)(4) or 410. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a
      qualified Plan of the Employer includes a terminated Plan maintained by
      the Employer within the five (5) year period ending on the Determination
      Date. In the case of a required aggregation group, each Plan in the group
      will


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

      be considered a top-heavy Plan if the required aggregation group is a
      top-heavy group. No Plan in the required aggregation group will be
      considered a top-heavy Plan if the required aggregation group is not a
      top-heavy group. All Employers aggregated under Code Sections 414(b), (c)
      or (m) or (o) (but only after the Code Section 414(o) regulations become
      effective) are considered a single Employer.

            15.3-5 A "permissive aggregation group" includes the required
      aggregation group of Plans plus any other qualified Plan(s) of the
      Employer that are not required to be aggregated but which, when considered
      as a group with the required aggregation group, satisfy the requirements
      of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 and are comparable to the Plans in the
      required aggregation group. No Plan in the permissive aggregation group
      will be considered a top-heavy Plan if the permissive aggregation group is
      not a top-heavy group. Only a Plan that is part of the required
      aggregation group will be considered a top-heavy Plan if the permissive
      aggregation group is top-heavy.

      15.4 Top-Heavy Rules of Application.

      For purposes of determining the value of Account balances and the present
value of accrued benefits the following provisions shall apply:

            15.4-1 The value of Account balances and the present value of
      accrued benefits will be determined as of the most recent Valuation Date
      that falls within or ends with the twelve (12) month period ending on the
      Determination Date.

            15.4-2 For purposes of testing whether this Plan is top-heavy, the
      present value of an individual's accrued benefits and an individual's
      Account balances is counted only once each year.

            15.4-3 The Account balances and accrued benefits of a Participant
      who is not presently a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a Plan
      Year beginning on or after January 1, 1984 will be disregarded.

            15.4-4 Employer contributions attributable to a salary reduction or
      similar arrangement will be taken into account.

            15.4-5 When aggregating Plans, the value of Account balances and
      accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the Determination
      Dates that fall within the same calendar year.

            15.4-6 The present value of the accrued benefits or the amount of
      the Account balances of an Employee shall be increased by the aggregate
      distributions made to such Employee from a Plan of the Employer. No
      distribution, however, made from the Plan to an individual (other than the
      beneficiary of a deceased Employee who was an Employee within the five (5)
      year period ending on the Determination Date) who has not been an Employee
      at any time during the five (5) year period ending on the Determination
      Date shall be taken into account in determining whether the Plan is
      top-heavy. Also, any amounts recontributed by an Employee upon becoming a
      Participant in the Plan shall no longer be counted as a distribution under
      this paragraph. For Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2001,
      present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of
      an Employee as of the determination date shall be increased by the
      distribution made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan
      aggregated with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the
      one-year period ending on the determination date. The preceding sentence
      shall also apply to distributions under a terminated


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

      plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been aggregated with
      the Plan under section 416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In the case of a
      distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death,
      or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting "five-year
      period" for "one-year period."

            15.4-7 The present value of the accrued benefits or the amount of
      the Account balances of an Employee shall be increased by the aggregate
      distributions made to such Employee from a terminated Plan of the
      Employer, provided that such Plan (if not terminated) would have been
      required to be included in the aggregation group.

            15.4-8 Accrued benefits and Account balances of an individual shall
      not be taken into account for purposes of determining the top-heavy ratios
      if the individual has performed no services for the Employer during the
      five (5) year period ending on the applicable Determination Date. For Plan
      Years commencing on or after January 1, 2001, the accrued benefits and
      Account balances of any individual who has not performed services for the
      Employer during the one-year period ending on the Determination Date
      should not be taken into account. Compensation for purposes of this
      subparagraph shall not include any payments made to an individual by the
      Employer pursuant to a qualified or non-qualified deferred compensation
      plan.

            15.4-9 The present value of the accrued benefits or the amount of
      the Account balances of any Employee participating in this Plan shall not
      include any rollover contributions or other transfers voluntarily
      initiated by the Employee except as described below. If a rollover was
      received by this Plan after December 31, 1983, the rollover or transfer
      voluntarily initiated by the Employee was received prior to January 1,
      1984, then the rollover or transfer shall be considered as part of the
      accrued benefit by the Plan receiving such rollover or transfer. If this
      Plan transfers or rolls over funds to another Plan in a transaction
      voluntarily initiated by the Employee after December 31, 1983, then this
      Plan shall count the distribution for purposes of determining Account
      balances or the present value of accrued benefits. A transfer incident to
      a merger or consolidation of two or more Plans of the Employer (including
      Plans of related Employers treated as a single Employer under Code Section
      414), or a transfer or rollover between Plans of the Employer, shall not
      be considered as voluntarily initiated by the Employee.

      15.5 Top-Heavy Ratio.

      If the Employer maintains one (1) or more defined contribution plans
(including any simplified Employee pension plan) and the Employer has never
maintained any defined benefit plans which have covered or could cover a
Participant in this Plan, the top-heavy ratio is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the sum of the Account balances of all Key Employees as of the
Determination Date, and the denominator of which is the sum of the Account
balances of all Employees as of the Determination Date. Both the numerator and
denominator of the top-heavy ratio shall be increased to reflect any
contribution which is due but unpaid as of the Determination Date.

      If the Employer maintains one (1) or more defined contribution plans
(including any simplified Employee pension plan) and the Employer maintains or
has maintained one (1) or more defined benefit plans which have covered or could
cover a Participant in this Plan, the top-heavy ratio is a fraction, the
numerator of which is the sum of Account balances under the defined contribution
plans for all Key Employees and the present value of accrued benefits under the
defined benefit plans for all Key Employees, and the denominator of which is the
sum of the Account balances under the defined contribution plans for all
Employees and the present value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit
plans for all Employees. For purposes of establishing present value to compute
the top-heavy ratio, any


                                      -46-

benefit shall be discounted only for mortality and interest based on an interest
rate of 8% and using the UP'84 Mortality Table.

      For these purposes, the accrued benefit of a Participant other than a Key
Employee in a defined benefit plan shall be determined under (a) the method, if
any, that uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans
maintained by the Employer, or (b) if there is no such method, as if such
benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under
the fractional rule of Section 411(b)(1)(C).

      This Section 15.5 shall be deleted, effective for limitation years
commencing on or after January 1, 2000.

      15.6 Minimum Contributions. For any Top-Heavy Year, each Employer shall
make a special contribution on behalf of each Participant to the extent that the
total allocations to his Account pursuant to Section 4 is less than the lesser
of:

            (i) three percent of his 415 Compensation for that year, or

            (ii) the highest ratio of such allocation to 415 Compensation
      received by any Key Employee for that year. For purposes of the special
      contribution of this Section 15.6, a Key Employee's 415 Compensation shall
      include amounts the Key Employee elected to defer under a qualified 401(k)
      arrangement. Such a special contribution shall be made on behalf of each
      Participant who is employed by an Employer on the last day of the Plan
      Year, regardless of the number of his Hours of Service, and shall be
      allocated to his Account.

      Employer Matching Contributions shall be taken into account for purposes
of satisfying the minimum contribution requirements of Section 416(c)(2) of the
Code and the Plan. The preceding sentence shall apply with respect to Matching
Contributions under the Plan or, if the Plan provides that the minimum
contribution requirement shall be met in another plan, such other plan. Employer
Matching Contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution
requirements shall be treated as Matching Contributions for purposes of the
actual contribution percentage test and other requirements of Section 401(m) of
the Code.

      If the Employer maintains a qualified plan in addition to this Plan and
more than one such plan is determined to be Top-Heavy, a minimum contribution or
a minimum benefit shall be provided in one of such other plans, including, after
January 1, 2001, a plan that consists solely of a cash or deferral arrangement
which meets the requirements of Section 401(k)(12) of the Code and matching
contributions with respect to the requirements of Section 401(m)(11) of the Code
are met. For any Plan Year when (1) the Plan is top-heavy and (2) a Non-key
Employee is a Participant in both this Plan and a defined benefit plan included
in the plan aggregation group which is top heavy, the sum of the Employer
contributions and forfeitures allocated to the Account of each such Non-key
Employee shall be equal to at least five percent (5%) of such Non-key Employee's
415 Compensation for that year.

      15.7 Minimum Vesting. For any Plan Year in which this Plan is Top-Heavy, a
Participant's vested interest in his Matching and ESOP Accounts shall be based
on the following vesting schedule:

            Vesting                        Percentage of
             Years                        Interest Vested
             -----                        ---------------

       Fewer than 3 years                        0%
               3                               100%


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

      For any Plan Year in which this Plan is Top-Heavy, a Participant shall be
100% vested in his Discretionary Contribution Account.

      15.8 Top-Heavy Provisions Control in Top-Heavy Plan. In the event this
Plan becomes top-heavy and a conflict arises between the top-heavy provisions
herein set forth and the remaining provisions set forth in this Plan, the
top-heavy provisions shall control.

                  Compensation."

      2.    Section 10.2-3 of the Plan, first sentence, shall be amended to read
