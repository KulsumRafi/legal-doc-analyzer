                                    GUARANTEE

     For value  received  and in  consideration  of any loan or other  financial
accommodation  of any  kind  heretofore,  now or  hereafter  made  or  given  by
Transamerica  Commercial  Finance  Corporation  ("TCFC")  to  Frontline  Network
Consulting,  Inc (the "Debtor") or to a customer of the Debtor,  the undersigned
(the "Guarantor")  unconditionally  guarantees the full and punctual payment and
performance when due,  whether upon demand,  at maturity or earlier by reason of
acceleration  or  otherwise,  and  at  all  times  thereafter,  of  all  of  the
indebtedness  and  obligations  of every  kind and  nature of the Debtor to TCFC
howsoever  created,  arising or  evidenced,  whether  arising  before or after a
bankruptcy of the Debtor,  whether  direct or indirect,  absolute or contingent,
joint or several,  now or hereafter existing,  or due or to become due (all such
indebtedness   and   obligations   being   hereinafter   referred   to  as   the
"Liabilities").  The  Guarantor  further  agrees to pay on demand  all costs and
expenses  incurred  by TCFC in  endeavoring  to collect  the  Liabilities  or in
enforcing this Guarantee.

     This is a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  The Guarantor agrees
that  the   obligations  of  the  Guarantor   under  this  Guarantee   shall  be
unconditional,  irrespective  of (i) the invalidity or  unenforceability  of the
Liabilities  or  any  agreement  or  instrument   relating  to  the  Liabilities
(sometimes hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "Documents") or any law
affecting the  Liabilities  or any Document;  (ii) the absence of any attempt to
collect the  Liabilities  from the Debtor or from any other person  primarily or
secondarily  liable with respect to the Liabilities or of any attempt to realize
upon any collateral for the  Liabilities,  for the obligations of any such other
person, or for this Guarantee;  (iii) any failure by TCFC to acquire, perfect or
maintain a security interest in or to protect any collateral for the Liabilities
or for  any  such  obligations;  (iv)  any  defense  arising  by  reason  of any
disability  or other  defense  of the Debtor or any other  person  liable on the
Liabilities  (v) the acceptance of additional  parties  primarily or secondarily
liable on the  Liabilities;  (vi) the  disallowance  or  avoidance of all or any
portion of TCFC's Claim(s) for repayment of the Liabilities or of any collateral
for the  Liabilities,  or (vii) any other  circumstance  which  might  otherwise
constitute a discharge or defense of a guarantor.

     Upon a default  under any Document,  TCFC may proceed  directly and at once
against  the  Guarantor  to collect the full amount of all or any portion of the
liability  of  the  Guarantor  hereunder,   without  notice  and  without  first
proceeding  against  the Debtor or any other  person  primarily  or  secondarily
liable on the Liabilities.  TCFC shall have the exclusive right to determine the
application of payments and credits, if any, from the Guarantor,  the Debtor, or
any other person primarily or secondarily liable on the Liabilities.

     TCFC Is hereby  authorized  without  notice  (which is hereby waived by the
Guarantor) and without affecting the liability of the Guarantor hereunder,  from
time to time to (i) renew,  extend,  accelerate  or  otherwise  change the time,
place or manner for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Liabilities,  or
otherwise  modify,  amend,  change  or waive  compliance  with the  terms of the
Liabilities  or  any of the  Documents;  (ii)  accept  partial  payments  on the
Liabilities;  (iii) take  collateral for the  Liabilities and the obligations of
any  other  person  primarily  or  secondarily  liable on the  Liabilities,  and
exchange,  release, realize upon or institute any proceeding to realize upon, or
liquidate any such  collateral;  (iv) apply such collateral and direct the order
or manner of sale thereof as TCFC may determine in its  discretion;  (v) release
or compromise,  in any manner,  or collect or initiate any proceeding to collect
the Liabilities or any portion thereof; (vi) extend additional loans, credit and
financial  accommodations  and otherwise create  additional  Liabilities,  (vii)
enforce or  institute  any  proceeding  to enforce  any other  guarantee  of the
Liabilities  or release,  or  compromise in any manner the  obligations  of, any
other person primarily or secondarily liable on the Liabilities.

     Until the  Liabilities  and other  obligations  of the Debtor to TCFC shall
have  been  paid  and  discharged  in full  and  all  Documents  (including  any
commitments with respect to any Liabilities) have been terminated, the Guarantor
shall have no right,  and agrees it will not make any claim,  against the Debtor
or any other person  primarily or  secondarily  liable on the  Liabilities  with
respect to or on account of any payment  which the Guarantor may make on account
of its obligations under this Guarantee, including without limitation, any right
of subrogation, exoneration, reimbursement, contribution or indemnification.

     In order to secure all of Guarantor's  obligations to TCFC pursuant to this
Guarantee, the undersigned Guarantor hereby grants to TCFC a continuing security
interest in all personal  property of  Guarantor,  including but not limited to,
all  inventory,   accounts   receivable,   equipment,   chattel  paper,   notes,
instruments,  contract  rights,  general  intangibles  and all  proceeds  of the
foregoing.

     If the Debtor or the Guarantor  shall die or if the Debtor or the Guarantor
should at any time dissolve or terminate its existence,  or become  insolvent or
make a general  assignment  for the benefit of  creditors,  or if a  bankruptcy,
insolvency  or  reorganization  proceeding  shall  be  filed  by or  against  or
commenced in respect of the Debtor or the Guarantor, the Guarantor shall, at the
option  of TCFC,  forthwith  pay TCFC the full  amount  which  would be  payable
hereunder by the Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable.

     The  Guarantor  Waives all  set-Offs  and  counterclaims  and all  notices,
presentments,  protests and demands of any kind with respect to the  Liabilities
and this  Guarantee  (including  without  limitation  demands  for  performance,
notices  of  non-payment  or  non-performance,  notices of  protest,  notices of
dishonor  and  notices of  acceptance  of this  Guarantee)  and  promptness  and
diligence with respect to the Liabilities.

     The  Guarantor  hereby  agrees  that TCFC  shall have no duty to advise !he
Guarantor of information  now or hereafter known to TCFC regarding the financial
or other  condition of the Debtor or any other person  primarily or  secondarily
liable on the Liabilities or regarding any  circumstance  bearing on the risk of
non-payment of the Liabilities.

     The  Guarantor  agrees to provide to TCFC,  promptly  after TCFC's  request
therefor,  such financial statements and other financial records and information
respecting  the  Guarantor as may be from time to time  requested  by TCFC.  The
Guarantor  authorizes TCFC to investigate or make inquiries of former or current
creditors or other persons and provide to any creditors or other persons any and
all  financial,  credit  of  other  information  regarding  or  relating  to the
Guarantor,  whether  supplied by the Guarantor to TCFC or otherwise  obtained by
TCFC, with such authority to continue throughout the term of this Guarantee.

     The Guarantor  agrees that the sale of inventory by TCFC to a person who is
liable to TCFC under a guarantee, endorsement,  repurchase agreement or the like
shall not be deemed to be a transfer  subject to Section 9-504(5) of the Uniform
Commercial  Code as in effect in Illinois or any similar  provision of any other
applicable  law, and the Guarantor  waives any provision to the contrary of such
laws.  The  Guarantor  agrees that  repurchase of inventory by a seller of goods
pursuant to a  repurchase  agreement  between  TCFC and such  seller  shall be a
commercially reasonable method of disposition.  The Guarantor shall be liable to

behalf by any  authorized  officer or agent of TCFC and delivered by TCFC to the
Guarantor.  TCFC's  failure at any time to  require  strict  performance  by the

affect or diminish  any right of TCFC at any time to demand  strict  performance
therewith.

undertakings  of the parties  hereto  concerning the subject  matter.  All prior
