full force and effect and the terms thereof are expressly incorporated herein
and are ratified and confirmed in all respects. This Amendment is not intended
to be or to create, nor shall it be construed as or constitute, a novation or an
accord and satisfaction but shall constitute an amendment of the Loan Agreement.
The parties hereto agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Loan
Agreement as amended by this Amendment as though such terms and conditions were
set forth herein in full. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this
Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided in this Amendment, operate as
a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Lender, nor constitute a waiver of any
provision of the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other
documents, instruments and agreements executed or delivered in connection
therewith or of any Default or Event of Default under any of the foregoing
whether arising before or after the Effective Date or as a result of performance

interpretation of this Amendment. This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. This Amendment may be executed by facsimile transmission, which
facsimile signatures shall be considered original executed counterparts for all
purposes, and each party to this Amendment agrees that it will be bound by its
own facsimile signature and that it accepts the facsimile signature of each
other party to this Amendment.

orally or by any course of dealing or in any other manner other than by the
written agreement of Lender and both Borrowers. This Amendment shall be
considered part of the Loan Agreement for all purposes under the Loan Agreement.

purposes under the Loan Agreement and other Loan Documents.

other Loan Documents and New Borrower Loan Documents constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

under this Amendment without the prior written consent of Lender. No rights are
intended to be created under this Amendment for the benefit of any third party

security interest or Lien. This Amendment shall be binding upon Borrowers and
their respective successors and assigns.
