</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Purchase Agreement, the Wesley Agreement, or the Connolly Agreement, if Buyer and the Company default in the manner specified in Section 4(b) of this Agreement, <A NAME="_DV_M29"><A NAME="_DV_M30"></A></A>neither Seller, Wesley or Connolly shall thereafter be required to comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 14.18 (a)(i) of the Purchase Agreement, (ii) <A NAME="_DV_M31"></A>Paragraphs 8 or <A NAME="_DV_M32"></A>9 of the Wesley Agreement, or (iii) <A NAME="_DV_M33"></A>Paragraphs 8 or <A NAME="_DV_M34"></A>9 of the Connolly Agreement<A NAME="_DV_M36"></A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Both the Wesley Agreement and the Connolly Agreement are also amended hereby as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a. &#9;Neither Buyer nor the Company is obligated to pay to Wesley or to Connolly, for any period of time, any amount(s) based upon a percentage of the revenues generated or received by the Buyer and/or the Company with respect to "pass-through business", such as the portion of the revenues generated by the Buyer from or with respect to services and/or contract personnel provided (directly or indirectly) by third party subcontractors to Wells Fargo Services Company, and/or any affiliated entity or entities (collectively referred to herein as "Wells Fargo"), pursuant to the Buyer's contract with Wells Fargo. <A NAME="_DV_M38"></A>The parties acknowledge that the <A NAME="_DV_M39"></A>total<A NAME="_DV_M40"></A> amount of<A NAME="_DV_M41"></A><STRIKE> <A NAME="_DV_M42"></A></STRIKE>"pass-through business" for 2002 was $9,764,719,<A NAME="_DV_M44"></A> and that any change to this number must be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b. &#9;For 2003 and thereafter, neither the Buyer nor the Company are obligated to pay Wesley or Connolly any amount based on one percent (1%), or two percent (2%) in the aggregate, of the revenues generated or received by the Buyer from or with respect to any clients, customers or contracts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c. &#9;For 2003, the Buyer and the Company shall pay to both Wesley and Connolly (i) an annual salary of $100,000.00 (payable on a monthly basis) as compensation, and (ii) an additional $50,000.00 per annum (payable in equal monthly installments) as a draw (herein collectively referred to as "Executive Draw") against commissions (as herein defined) earned by the respective individuals in 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d. &#9;For the year 2003, the Company shall pay commissions to both Wesley and Connolly which shall be based upon the Buyer's EBITDA for 2003, and which are hereby defined to be an amount equal to<A NAME="_DV_M48"></A> the sum of<A NAME="_DV_M49"></A> the following: (i) five percent (5%) of the Buyer's EBITDA for 2003, (ii) two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Buyer's EBITDA for 2003 in excess of $1,250, 000.00, and (iii) two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Buyer's EBITDA for 2003 in excess of $1,750,000.00. If one or both Wesley and Connolly are employed by the Buyer for less than all of 2003, for any reason, calculation of commissions earned will not change, but the amount of commissions payable to the individual(s) not employed for the full year will be proportionate to the period of time such individual(s) was employed by the Buyer (for example, if Wesley is only employed for six months in 2003, the commissions, if any, payable to her would be reduced by fifty percent (50%). The amount of commissions earned by Wesley and Connolly for 2003 shall be promptly determined by the Buyer in 2004, and the amount of commissions earned by each such individual, after deducting therefrom the amount of Executive Draw paid to such individual, shall be paid to them on or before April 15, 2004. In making the calculation of Buyer's EBITDA for 2003, no deduction shall be made by the Company for the Corporate Charge, but the Buyer shall be entitled to deduct $60,000.00 per annum (based upon $5,000.00 per month) as an amount which the parties agree to be reasonable in connection with the Company's costs of providing accounting and IT related services to the Buyer for 2003; provided, however, such amount may be revised if the level of activities for Buyer in 2003 change dramatically from the level of activity for 2002 (any such change must be reasonable and must be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, in advance of any change in the deduction being taken).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">f. &#9;If Wesley and/or Connolly do not earn sufficient commissions in 2003 to equal or exceed the amount of the Executive Draw paid to such individual, the shortfall amount (which is hereby defined to be the amount of the Executive Draw paid, less the amount of commissions earned by such individual for 2003), shall be deemed to be earned compensation and shall not be repayable to the Buyer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">g. &#9;Unless and until the Company shall inform Wesley and Connolly to the contrary, during the period of time of employment by the Buyer, both Wesley and Connolly shall report directly to Allan Hartley in connection with performing their duties on behalf of the Buyer.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. Unless and until the Buyer and the Company are notified in writing to the contrary by Wesley and Connolly, all amounts payable to Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or to this Agreement shall actually be paid in equal proportions to Wesley and Connolly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8. Except as otherwise amended herein, the Purchase Agreement, the Wesley Agreement the Connolly Agreement remain in full force and effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This Agreement is effective as of January 1, 2003, but is actually executed this 18<SUP>th</SUP> day of February, 2003.</P>
