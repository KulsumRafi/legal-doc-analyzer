                                Letter Agreement
                              Regarding Impositions


                                December 17, 2002


Koger Ravinia, LLC ("Grantor")
Koger Equity, Inc. ("Guarantor")

Re:      Loan (the "Loan") in the amount of $85,000,000.00 as evidenced by that
         certain Promissory Note ("Note") in such amount made by Grantor dated
         of even date herewith payable to the order of Metropolitan Life
         Insurance Company ("Lender") which Note is secured by, among other
         things, that certain Deed to Secure Debt, Security Agreement and
         Fixture Filing (the "Deed to Secure Debt") given by Grantor for the
         benefit of Lender; which Deed to Secure Debt conveys the property
         ("Property") more particularly described in Exhibit "A" attached
         thereto. All capitalized terms appearing herein and not otherwise
         defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Deed to
         Secure Debt

Gentlemen:

This will confirm our agreement that notwithstanding Section 2.05 of the Deed to
Secure Debt, Lender agrees that no escrow for "Impositions" as that term is
defined in the Deed to Secure Debt shall be required of Grantor unless and until
(i) there is a default under the Loan Documents or the Unsecured Indemnity
Agreement or the Guaranty; (ii) the original Grantor no longer owns the
Property; or (iii) there has been a change in the Grantor or in the general
partners, stockholders or members of Grantor or in the constituent general
partners or controlling shareholders or controlling members of any of the
entities comprising Grantor in violation of the Deed to Secure Debt; or (iv)
such Impositions deposits are required in connection with a securitization or
participation of the Loan. In the event any of these events occur, Lender
reserves the right to require Impositions deposits at any time in its absolute
discretion notwithstanding the fact that the default may be cured, or that the
transfer or change be approved by Lender.

Grantor, Guarantor and Lender agree that notwithstanding the terms and
provisions of Section 11 of the Note, Section 9.01 of the Deed to Secure Debt
and any other similar provisions of the Loan Documents, to the extent that
Lender does not require Impositions deposits pursuant to this waiver, the Loan
shall be recourse (and the Grantor and Guarantor shall be personally liable to
Lender) to the extent that any obligations for which an Impositions deposit was
not required was not paid by Grantor.

Sincerely,

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
