the ability of the Employee&#146;s employer to terminate the Employee&#146;s employment
relationship at any time with or without cause insofar as permitted by
law;&#160; (vi)&#160; that the value of this Option is an extraordinary item of
compensation which is outside the scope of the Employee's employment contract,
if any; (vii) that this Option is not part of normal or expected compensation,
and will not be included for purposes of calculating any severance,
resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards,
pension or retirement benefits or similar payments insofar as permitted by law;
(viii) that the vesting of any option ceases upon termination of employment for
any reason except as may otherwise be explicitly provided in the Plan document
