                the "Retained Liabilities." Seller agrees to pay the Retained
                Liabilities in full. Without limiting the generality or effect
                of the foregoing, Buyer does not assume, nor is it liable or

                                (i)     all liabilities of Seller in respect of

                        operations before the Closing Date (as defined in
                        Section 1.8 below) or arising from the sale of the
                        assets contemplated hereunder;

                        Transferred Employees (as defined in Section 1.4(b)
                        below); and

                                (iii)   all liabilities and fees and expenses
                        incurred in connection with the sale of the assets to
                        Buyer; or

                                (iv)    any liabilities or obligations of Seller
                        or its Affiliates or their respective
                        predecessors-in-interest, whether or not arising out of
                        or relating to the conduct of the Division or associated
                        with or arising from any of the Purchased Assets or any
                        other rights, properties or assets used in or associated
                        with the Division at any time, whether fixed or
                        contingent or known or unknown.

        1.4     Employees.

        their dependents and beneficiaries to the extent relating to or as a
        result of: (i) the employment of any such employee by Seller on or prior

        liabilities under any Employee Plan that provides severance pay; and
        (ii) the participation in or accrual of benefits or compensation under,

                Division in full on or prior to any due date for such payment
                (except for any amounts which Seller is disputing in good
                faith); in the event Seller fails to make such payments, Buyer
                may make such payments on Seller's behalf and such amount shall
                be promptly reimbursed by Seller to Buyer. Buyer shall pay all
                debts incurred by Buyer in connection with the operation of the
                Division on and after the Closing Date.

                period before the Closing Date and specifically including any
                taxes that are a result of the consummation of the transactions

                taxes, sales or use taxes, franchise taxes, payroll taxes, and
                any other taxes which may be due by it for revenues earned with
                respect to the Division prior to the Closing Date and
                specifically including any taxes that are a result of the
                consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                and hold harmless the other party from any damages, costs or

                1.5.3   Payment of Taxes and Other Expenses. If either party
receives an invoice for any tax or other expense which is allocable to the other
party in part or in full hereunder, the recipient shall forward a copy of the
invoice promptly to the other party. If the other party is fully liable for such
invoice it shall pay it in full promptly; provided, however, that such party may
contest any tax or other expense in good faith through appropriate proceedings.
If either party receives an invoice for taxes or other expenses that are
allocable partly to it and partly to the other party, then the party receiving
such notice shall promptly advise the other party that such invoice has been
received and shall request the appropriate reimbursement from that party. The
party owing such reimbursement shall pay such reimbursement within ten days
after receipt of an invoice for the reimbursable amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, whenever time permits, each party will make every reasonable effort
to determine each party's appropriate allocable share of any tax due and to pay
the allocable share to the party responsible under this paragraph for paying the
tax in a timely fashion in order to avoid any late payment penalty.

        1.6     Nonassignable Contracts, Leases and Permits. In the case of any
of the Purchased Assets that are not by their terms assignable or that require
the consent of a third party in connection with the transfer by Seller hereunder
and such assignment is not consented to prior to the Closing Date, this
Agreement shall constitute an assignment, transfer or conveyance to Buyer of all
of Seller's right, title and interest therein to the extent permitted. In
addition, Seller will use its reasonable best efforts at its sole cost and
expense to assist Buyer in such manner as may reasonably be requested by Buyer
for purpose of obtaining such consent promptly. During such period in which the
applicable Purchased Asset is not capable of being assigned to Buyer due to the
failure to obtain any required consent, Seller will make such arrangements as
may be necessary to enable Buyer to receive all the economic benefits under such
assigned contracts, assigned lease or permit accruing on and after the Closing
Date (including, to the extent permissible, through sub-contracting,
sub-leasing, sub-licensing, or sub-participation arrangement, or an arrangement
under which the Seller would enforce such Purchased Asset for the benefit of
Buyer, with Buyer, to the extent permissible, assuming Seller's executory
obligations and any and all rights of Seller against the other party thereto).
If the approval of the other party to the Purchased Asset is obtained, such
approval will, as between Seller and Buyer, constitute a confirmation
(automatically and without further action of the parties) that such Purchased
Asset is assigned to Buyer as of the Closing Date.

        1.7     Allocation. The consideration for the Purchased Assets shall be
allocated as set forth on Schedule 1.7. The parties agree to be bound by such
allocation of the consideration for all purposes, including for accounting and
all federal and state taxes.

        1.8     Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall be on March 17, 2003 (the "Closing Date") at the
offices of Porter & Hedges, L.L.P., 700 Louisiana, Suite 3500, Houston, Texas
77002, or such other time and place as the parties hereto may agree.
Transactions affecting the Division on the Closing Date will be for the benefit
of the Buyer if the Closing is consummated.

instruments to which the Seller is a party and to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, deliver and performance of this

Applicable Environmental Laws. Buyer is not required to obtain permits, licenses
or similar authorizations pursuant to any Applicable Environmental Laws in

                                    ARTICLE 5

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        5.1     Indemnification of Buyer. In addition to any other remedies
available to Buyer under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, Seller and the
Shareholders, jointly and severally shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders, against
and with respect to any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses,
obligations, liabilities, recoveries, suits, causes of action and deficiencies,
including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
(collectively, the "Damages") that such indemnitees shall incur or suffer, which
arise, result from or relate to (a) any breach of, or failure by Seller to
perform, any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement or in any schedule, certificate, exhibit or other instrument furnished
to Buyer by Seller under this Agreement; (b) the operation of the Division prior
to the date hereof; (c) the Excluded Assets or (d) the Retained Liabilities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 5.1 shall not
apply to any Damages that the Buyer shall incur or suffer which arise, result
from or relate to discrepancies as to the existence or physical presence of the
Inventory listed on Schedule 1.2(b) on or after the Closing Date.

        5.2     Indemnification of Seller. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller and its respective employees and agents against and with
respect to any and all Damages

                                       13

<PAGE>

that such indemnitees shall incur or suffer, which arise, result from or relate
to any breach of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any schedule,
certificate, exhibit or other instrument furnished or to be furnished by or on
behalf of Buyer under this Agreement.

        5.3     Indemnification Procedure. In the event that any party discovers
or otherwise becomes aware of an indemnification claim arising under Section 5.1
or Section 5.2 of this Agreement, such indemnified party shall give written
notice to the indemnifying party, specifying such claim, and may thereafter
exercise any remedies available to such party under this Agreement; provided,
however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any obligations hereunder, to
the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced thereby. Further,
promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of
the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for
indemnification may be made pursuant to this Article V, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying
party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action;
provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any obligations
hereunder, to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced
thereby. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense
thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the
extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party, and after such notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense
of such claim and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
person. An indemnifying party who elects not to assume the defense of a claim
shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel in any
single jurisdiction for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim or with respect to claims separate but similar or related
in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the indemnified party will
be entitled to select its own counsel and assume the defense of any action
brought against it if the indemnifying party fails to select counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, the expenses of such defense to be paid
by the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to a claim without the
consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, or unless such judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party
of a release from all liability with respect to such claim. No indemnified party
shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such
action, the defense of which has been assumed by an indemnifying party, without
the consent of such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

        5.4     Survival of Representations and Warranties. Regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any party hereto or of any
information any party may have as a result of any such investigation, all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made in or pursuant to
this Agreement shall, except as otherwise provided in this Section,

                                       14

<PAGE>

survive the Closing Date and shall continue in effect indefinitely thereafter
unless and until terminated as provided in this Section. The representations and
warranties made by the Seller in Article 2 hereof (other than in Sections 2.1.1,
2.1.2, 2.1.9, 2.1.11(a), 2.1.12, 2.1.13 and 2.1.15 hereof) and the
representations and warranties made by Buyer in Article 3 (other than Sections
3.1.1 and 3.1.2), and all right to indemnification arising under Sections 5.1 or
5.2 hereof as a result of the breach of any such representation or warranty,
shall terminate on the date which is twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date. The representations and warranties made by the Seller in Sections
2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.11(a) and 2.1.13, and the representations and warranties made
by the Buyer in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, shall survive the Closing Date
indefinitely. The representations and warranties made by the Seller in Sections
2.1.9, 2.1.12, 2.1.14 and 2.1.15 shall terminate on the date the statute of
limitations and times for assessment (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof with respect to any liability in question) has run in favor of
the Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, against the federal, state or local
government, as the case may be. The termination of the representations and
warranties of the respective parties hereunder shall not limit or impair any
representation or warranty or any related right or claim for indemnification as
to which any party hereto has delivered a written notice of such claim to the
party against whom the indemnification is made, so long as the notice of such
claim was delivered prior to the termination date of the representations and
warranties of the respective parties made hereunder.

        5.5     Limitations.

                5.5.1   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
aggregate liability of the Seller for Damages under Section 5.1(a) shall not
exceed the Purchase Price, (ii) the aggregate liability of Buyer for Damages
under Section 5.2 shall not exceed the Purchase Price, and (iii) neither the
Seller nor the Buyer shall be liable under Section 5.1(a) and Section 5.2,
respectively, unless and until the aggregate Damages for which he or it would
otherwise be liable exceed $50,000 (at which point the Seller and the Buyer
shall become liable for the aggregate Damages, not just amounts in excess of
$50,000); provided that the limitations set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above shall not apply to (A) a claim pursuant to Section 5.1 relating to either
a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1.9,
2.1.12, 2.1.13 and 2.1.15, (B) a claim pursuant to Section 5.2 relating to
either a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.1.1, or 3.1.2, or (C) a claim pursuant to Section 5.1(b), Section 5.1(c),
Section 5.1(d) or Section 5.2(b).

                5.5.2   Except with respect to claims based on fraud, after the
Closing Date, the rights of the indemnified parties under this Article 5 shall
be the exclusive remedy of the indemnified parties with respect to claims for
monetary damages resulting from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

                5.5.3   The amount of Damages recoverable by an indemnified
party under this Article 5 with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced
by any proceeds received or receivable by such indemnified party or an
Affiliate, with respect to the Damages to which such indemnity claim relates,
from an insurance carrier.

                           LIMITATIONS ON COMPETITION

        6.1     Prohibited Activities

                6.1.1   Seller. Seller, Whitehead and Owen agree that Seller,
Whitehead and Owen will not during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending 3 years after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, individually or
collectively, for any reason, for Seller's, Whitehead's or Owen's account or on
behalf of or together with any other person:

                (a)     engage as an officer, director or in any other
        managerial capacity or as an owner, co-owner or other investor of or in,
        whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant or advisor,
        in any business in competition with the Division of Seller within the
        State of Texas (for purposes of this Article 6, the territory within the
        States of Texas is called the "Buyer's Territory");

                (b)     call on any natural person who is at that time employed
        by Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively referred to in this Article 6
        as the "Buyer Group") with the purpose or intent of attracting that
        person from the employ of the Buyer Group;

                (c)     call on any person that at that time is, or at any time
        within one year prior to that time was, a customer of the Division of
        Seller, (i) for the purpose of soliciting or selling any product or
        service in competition with the Division within the Buyer's Territory
        and (ii) with the knowledge of the customer relationship; or

                (d)     call on any Buyer Acquisition Candidate (as hereinafter
        defined), with the knowledge of that person's status as a Buyer
        Acquisition Candidate, for the purpose of acquiring that person or
        arranging the acquisition of that person by any person other than the
        Buyer Group.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller may own and hold as a passive
        investment up to 5% of a class of the outstanding equity interest of a
        competing entity if that class of equity interest is publicly traded.

                6.1.2   Buyer. Buyer agrees that Buyer will not during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending 3 years after the Closing Date,
directly or indirectly, for any reason, for Buyer's account or on behalf of or
together with any other person:

                (a)     engage as an officer, director or in any other
        managerial capacity or as an owner, co-owner or other investor of or in,
        whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant or advisor,
        in any business in competition with the continuing business of Seller to
        provide lighting products and accessories to suppliers or contractors of
        developers or directly to the developers of new construction of
        single-family dwellings (the "Single Family Division") within the State
        of Texas (for purposes of this Article 6, the territory within the State
        of Texas is called the "Seller's Territory"); provided, however, that
        Buyer may provide lighting products and accessories to Integrated

                                       16

<PAGE>

        Electrical Services and any of its Affiliates (as listed on Schedule
        6.1.2 attached hereto) within the Seller's Territory without violating
        the provisions of this Section 6.1.2(a);

                (b)     with the exception of the Transferred Employees, call on
        any natural person who is at that time employed by Seller or its
        Affiliates (collectively referred to in this Article 6 as the "Seller
        Group") with the purpose or intent of attracting that person from the
        employ of the Seller Group; or

                (c)     call on any person that at that time is, or at any time
        within one year prior to that time was, a customer of the of Seller's
        Single Family Division, (a) for the purpose of soliciting or selling any
        product or service in competition with the Single Family Division of the
        Seller Group within the Seller's Territory and (b) with the knowledge of
        the customer relationship.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may own and hold as a passive
        investment up to 5% of a class of the outstanding equity interest of a
        competing entity if that class of equity interest is publicly traded.

        6.2     Specific Performance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
7.3, because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to the non-breaching
party as a result of any breach by the other party of the covenants contained in
Section 6.1 and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that could be
caused to the non-breaching party for which it would have no other adequate
remedy, the Seller and the Buyer agree that the non-breaching party may enforce
the provisions of Section 6.1 by injunctions and restraining orders against the
other party if the other party breaches any of those provisions.

        6.3     Reasonable Restraints. The parties each agree that Sections 6.1
and 6.2 impose a reasonable restraint on the parties in light of the activities
and business of the parties on the date hereof and the current business plans of
the parties.

        6.4     Covenants Severable. The covenants in this Article 6 are
severable and separate. The unenforceability of any specific covenant in this
Article 6 is not intended by any party to, and shall not, affect the provisions
of any other covenant in this Article 6. If any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth in Section
6.1 are unreasonable, the parties acknowledge their mutual intention and
agreement that those restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent the court
deems reasonable, and thereby shall be reformed.

        6.5     Independent Covenant. All the covenants in this Article 6 are
intended by each party to, and shall be construed as an agreement independent of
any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action of one party against the other, whether predicated on this Agreement
or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of any covenant
in this Article 6. It is specifically agreed that the period specified in
Section 6.1 shall be computed by excluding from that computation any time during
which any party is in violation of any provision of Section 6.1. The covenants
contained in this Article 6 shall not be affected by any breach of any other
provision of this Agreement by any party.

                                       17

        6.6     Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, each of the
following terms has the meaning set forth below:

                (a)     "Affiliate" when used to indicate a relationship with
        any Person, means: any person that directly, or indirectly through one
        or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
        common control with, or is acting as agent on behalf of, or as an
        officer or director of, such person. As used in the definition of
        Affiliate, the term "control" (including the terms "controlling,"

        "controlled by" or "under common control with") means the possession,
        direct or indirect, of the power to direct, cause the direction of or
        influence the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
        ownership of voting securities, by contract, through the holding of a
        position as a director or officer of such person, or otherwise.

                (b)     "Buyer Acquisition Candidate" means any person engaged
        in the business of the Division and which shall have been called on by
        any member of the Buyer Group in connection with the possible
        acquisition by any of them of that person or with respect to which any
        member of the Buyer Group has made an acquisition analysis.

        6.7     Material Term of Agreement. The parties hereby agree that this
Article 6 is a material and substantial part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 7

        7.3     Dispute Resolution.

                (a)     The parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
        dispute arising under this Agreement, including any claim for
        indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Article 5 of this
        Agreement. If, after no less than thirty days, the parties are unable to
        resolve a dispute, such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration
        in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 7.3;
        provided that any party may seek injunctive relief or other equitable
        relief to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.

                (b)     Any party to this Agreement may submit any dispute which
        is subject to arbitration under this Section 7.3 by giving written
        notice to all other parties hereto. Within ten business days after
        receipt of such notice by all other parties, Buyer, on one hand, and the
        Seller, on the other hand, shall each appoint one arbitrator, and within
        ten business days thereafter the two arbitrators so appointed shall
        select a third arbitrator. If Buyer or the Seller shall fail to make
        such appointment within such ten-day period, then any party may request
        the American Arbitration Association to appoint the second arbitrator.
        The American Arbitration Association may thereupon appoint the second
        arbitrator. If the two appointed arbitrators shall fail to select a
        third arbitrator within said ten-day period, the parties hereto shall
        mutually select the third arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree
        upon such selection within two business days, then any party may, upon
        at least five business days' prior written notice to all other parties,
        request the American Arbitration Association to appoint the third
        arbitrator. The American Arbitration Association may thereupon appoint
        the third arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
        with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
        Association, as then in effect, except as otherwise provided in this
        Section 7.3. The arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas.

                (c)     The three arbitrators shall investigate the facts and
        shall hold hearings at which the parties hereto may present evidence and
        arguments, be represented by counsel and conduct cross-examination. The
        three arbitrators shall render a written decision on the matter
        presented to them by majority vote as soon as practicable after the
        appointment of the third arbitrator and in any event not more than 30
        days after such appointment. The decision of the arbitrators, which may
        include equitable relief, shall be final and binding on the parties
        hereto, and judgment upon the decision may be entered in any court
        having jurisdiction thereof. If the three arbitrators shall fail to
        render a decision within said 30-day period, either party may institute
        such action or proceeding in such court as shall be appropriate in the
        circumstances and upon the institution of such action, the arbitration
        proceedings shall be terminated and shall be of no further force and
        effect. The prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys'
        fees, expert and nonexpert witness costs and expenses, and other costs
        and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration, and the fees
        and costs of the arbitrators shall be borne by the nonprevailing party
        unless, in either case, the arbitrators for good cause determine
        otherwise. In resolving any dispute, the arbitrators shall apply the
        provisions of this Agreement, without varying therefrom in any respect.
        The arbitrators shall not have the power to add to, modify or change any
        of the provisions of this Agreement.

        7.4     Rights of Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement on any persons other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, nor shall any provision give any third persons any right
of subrogation or action against any party to this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood that this Agreement
does not create any third party beneficiary rights.

        7.5     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

        7.6     Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
or superseded only by written instrument executed by each party hereto. Any
waiver of the terms, provisions, covenants, representations, warranties, or
conditions hereof shall be made only by a written instrument executed and
delivered by an authorized officer of such party. The failure of either party at
any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no
manner affect the right to enforce the same. No waiver by either party of any
condition, or of the breach of any term, provision, covenant, representation, or
warranty contained in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or the breach of any other term,
provision, covenant, representation, or warranty.

        7.7     Entire Agreement; Conflicts. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto, all of which are by this reference fully
incorporated into this Agreement) and the documents and materials expressly
referred to in schedules or exhibits hereto sets forth the entire Agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements, and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between the provisions of this

                                       20

Agreement and the contents or provisions of any schedule or exhibit hereto, the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed controlling.

        7.8     Successors and Assigns. All of the terms, provisions, covenants,
representations, warranties, and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding
on and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors, but this Agreement and the rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or delegable by any party; except
that Buyer may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer and such Affiliate
may collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to its senior lender.

        7.9     Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to
the laws which would otherwise apply by application of Texas' internal
principles of conflicts of law.

        7.10    Severability. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be
the intention of the parties that they would have executed this Agreement had
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions which may be hereafter
declared invalid, void, or unenforceable not initially been included herein.

        7.11    Headings and Captions. The headings and captions contained in
this Agreement are solely for convenient reference and shall not be deemed to
affect the meaning or interpretation of any article, section, or paragraph
hereof.

        7.12    Successor Laws. Reference made herein to any law or statute
shall include reference to any future law amending or superseding such law or
statute and to any future laws applicable to the same subject matter.
