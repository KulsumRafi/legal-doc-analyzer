               APPLIED DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AGREES TO FORBEARANCE
            AGREEMENT WITH IBM CREDIT, LLC, THE COMPANY'S SENIOR
                               SECURED LENDER

           RICHARD J. SULLIVAN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM COMPANY -
            SCOTT R. SILVERMAN ASSUMES TITLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CEO

PALM BEACH, FL - MARCH 27, 2003 - APPLIED DIGITAL SOLUTIONS, INC. (NASDAQ:
ADSX), an advanced technology development company, announced today that it
has agreed to the terms of a forbearance agreement with IBM Credit LLC, the
Company's senior secured lender, granting Applied Digital more favorable
loan repayment terms and more time in which to meet its current obligations
to IBM Credit. The specific terms of the agreement have been attached as an
exhibit to the Company's form 8-K to be filed today.

In summary, the terms of the agreement include, but are not limited to, the
following:

     o    The forbearance by IBM Credit of the current outstanding
          obligation (of approximately $95 million) owed by Applied Digital,
          subject to continued compliance with the covenants in the
          Forbearance Agreement and Credit Agreement.

     o    Various purchase rights of Applied Digital to buy back its
          existing indebtedness from IBM Credit. These rights include a
          one-time payment, on or before June 30, 2003, of $30 million. If
          this particular payment is made, Applied Digital would satisfy its
          full obligation to IBM Credit.

     o    A substantial reduction in the effective interest rate.

     o    The implementation of certain agreed procedures, including
          the engagement of an investment banker, to facilitate the
          valuation and potential sale of some or all of the shares
          of Digital Angel Corporation held beneficially by Applied
          Digital through the Digital Angel Share Trust.

     o    The imposition of additional limitations on permitted expenditures
          by Applied Digital and a requirement that the Company take steps
          towards valuing and, if necessary, selling some of its assets.

     o    The dismissal of the complaint filed by Applied Digital on March
          6, 2003, against IBM Credit and IBM Corporation.

The Company also announced that Richard J. Sullivan has retired from his
positions as Chairman and CEO, effective March 21, 2003. Applied Digital's
Board of Directors negotiated a severance agreement, reduced from the terms
of Mr. Sullivan's existing employment contract, providing for a one-time
payment of approximately $10.6 million in restricted stock instead of a
potential $17 million obligation contained in Mr. Sullivan's employment
contract.

as Applied Digital's President since March 2002 and who led the most recent
discussions with IBM Credit, will assume the titles of Chairman and CEO,
effective immediately.

A graduate of The University of Pennsylvania (1985) and Villanova University
School of Law (1989), Mr. Silverman, 39, began his career as an attorney
specializing in commercial litigation and communications law. He has served

1996, ATI Communications was acquired by Applied Digital Solutions, Inc.
From 1997 to 1999, Mr. Silverman was Vice President, Business Development
of Applied Digital. From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Silverman operated his own
private-investment banking firm and has provided consulting,
