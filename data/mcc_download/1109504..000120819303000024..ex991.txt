ARTICLE 8
Definitions

8.1     For all intents and purposes of this Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires:

(a)     "Funded Debt" shall mean, as of the date of determination thereof, all
        Indebtedness of Borrower other than Current Liabilities and
        Subordinated Debt.

(b)     "Indebtedness" shall mean all items which, in accordance with
        generally accepted principles of accounting, would be included in
        determining total liabilities as shown on the liability side of a
        balance sheet as at the date Indebtedness is to be determined and, in
        any event, shall include any liability secured by any mortgage,
        pledge, lien, or security interest on property owned or acquired,
        whether or not such liability shall have been assumed, and guarantees,
        endorsements (other than for collection in the ordinary course of
        business), and other contingent obligations in respect of the
        obligations of others.  A lease required to be capitalized in
        accordance with generally accepted principles of accounting creates
        Indebtedness for purposes of this definition.

(c)     A "person" shall include an individual, a corporation, an association,
        a joint stock borrower, a business trust, a partnership, a joint
        venture, a limited liability borrower, an unincorporated organization,
        or a government or any agency or political subdivision thereof.

(d)     "Subordinated Debt" shall mean all Indebtedness of Borrower for
        borrowed money, none of the principal amount of which shall by its
        terms be due and payable prior to the final maturity date of the Note,
        which shall have been subordinated to the prior payment in full of
        Borrower's Indebtedness to Lender by execution and delivery to Lender
        by such subordinated Lender and Borrower, prior to the creation of
        such Indebtedness, of agreements of subordination in form and
        substance satisfactory to Lender.

and payable on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday under the laws of
Nevada, such payment may be made on the next succeeding business day, and such

parties and their respective successors and assigns, and all subsequent
holders of the Note.

                        (a)     any amount owing under this note is not paid when due and after the

Default Interest        The outstanding balance of any amount owing under this Interest note which is
                        not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per annum

                        of such maximum rate, then the amount so paid will not constitute interest but
                        will constitute a prepayment on account of the principal amount of this note.
