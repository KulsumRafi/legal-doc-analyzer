</U><P ALIGN="CENTER">RETENTION AGREEMENT<BR>
PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY</P>
</B><P>&#9;This Retention Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of October _<U>2</U>_, 2002, between Portland General Electric Company ("PGE") and <B>Pamela Lesh</B> ("Employee").</P>
<P>&#9;WHEREAS, Employee previously entered into a retention agreement with Enron Corp. ("Enron") pursuant to which Enron agreed to pay certain retention payments and/or sale bonus payments to Employee (the "Enron Retention Agreement"); and</P>
<P>&#9;WHEREAS, PGE desires to enter into this Agreement with Employee to provide a method for providing retention payments (the "Retention Payments") to encourage the Employee to remain employed with PGE and in exchange for PGE's agreement to make the Retention Payments, Employee agrees that the Enron Retention Agreement shall terminate; and</P>
<P>&#9;WHEREAS, Employee is willing to enter into this Agreement under the terms and conditions specified herein;</P>
<P>&#9;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the covenants hereafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:</P>
<OL>

<U><LI>Retention Payments</U>.</LI>
<P>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Employee shall be eligible to receive Retention Payments as follows:</P>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>Subject to Employee's execution of the Termination Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A and a General Release in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, a payment in the amount of $<U>125,000.00</U> (less usual and customary taxes, deductions, and withholdings) shall be paid in cash to Employee if employed by PGE on the date Employee signs this Agreement with payment to be made in accordance with Section 3, below; and </LI>
<LI>Subject to Employee's execution of a General Release in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, a payment in the amount of $<U>125,000.00</U> (less usual and customary taxes, deductions, and withholdings) shall be paid in cash to Employee if employed by PGE on June 15, 2003 with payment to be made in accordance with Section 3, below.</LI></OL>

<U><LI>Termination of Employment</U>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>In the event Employee is involuntarily terminated by PGE without "Cause" or Employee dies or becomes "Disabled" prior to the payment of either Retention Payment described in Section 1 above, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3 below, Employee, or Employee's estate in the event of death, shall nonetheless receive such UNPAID Retention Payment(s) in accordance with Section 3, below. </LI>
<LI>Employee shall not receive any UNPAID Retention Payment(s) provided hereunder if prior to the payment date(s): (i) Employee voluntarily terminates employment with PGE, (ii) Employee is terminated for "Cause," or (iii) Employee retires. If Employee accepts a different position with PGE during the term of this Agreement, as long as such change is approved by the President and CEO of PGE, such change shall not disqualify Employee under (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Subsection 2B from any Retention Payment. Should Employee reduce the hours he or she works for PGE on a monthly basis, this shall not disqualify Employee under (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Subsection 2B from any Retention Payment, but the amount of the Retention Payment under Subsection 1B shall be reduced by the same percentage as the reduction in hours worked.</LI>
<LI>The following terms shall have the following meanings:</LI><OL START=0>

<OL TYPE="i">

<U><LI>"Disabled" and "Disability"</U> shall mean Employee's inability to perform the essential functions of his or her position with or without reasonable accommodation, as determined by any long term disability plan maintained by PGE in which Employee is a participant or, in absence of such participation, as determined by PGE's Vice President of Human Resources.</LI>
<U><LI>"Involuntary termination" </U>shall mean any termination of Employee's employment by PGE that is not a termination "for Cause" as defined below or a termination due to death or Disability.</LI>
<U><LI>"Termination for Cause"</U> shall mean a termination of Employee's employment by PGE as the result of (a) Employee's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or neglect in the performance of Employee's duties and services as a PGE employee; (b) Employee's conviction of a felony; (c) Employee's breach of any provision of this Agreement; (d) Employee's material violation of any material policy of PGE, or (e) Employee's violation of any federal, state or local law or regulation in the performance or nonperformance of Employee's duties for PGE.</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

<U><LI>Conditions to Receipt of Retention Payments</U>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>The Retention Payment provided for under Subsection 1A is conditioned upon Employee's execution of the Termination Agreement and a General Release in substantially the same form as attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Retention Payment provided for under Subsection 1B is conditioned upon Employee's execution of a General Release in substantially the same form as attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Releases shall be provided to the Employee on or before the dates specified in Subsections 1A and B above, or on or before the Employee's involuntary termination date, or within thirty (30) days of Employee's death or the date that Employee becomes Disabled, as applicable. Payment will be made at least seven (7) days but not more than ten (10) days after the execution of each General Release by Employee, so long as each said General Release is not revoked pursuant to its terms.</LI>
<LI>If prior to the payment of the Retention Payment provided in Subsection 1B, Employee becomes eligible to receive restricted or unrestricted stock or employer granted </LI></OL>

<P>restricted or unrestricted stock options from PGE, any successor in interest, or any business entity emerging from the bankrupt estates of Enron or any of its subsidiaries, or any or all of their subsidiaries (one such potential entity or successor currently being commonly referred to as "OpCo"), whether pursuant to a reorganization or a court approved sale of assets or stock, Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that any stock or stock options which he or she may be eligible to receive shall be reduced by any Retention Payment that is payable pursuant to Subsection 1B. For purposes of calculating the foregoing reduction, the valuation of said stock or stock options shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of PGE, taking into account any characteristics of said stock or stock options that may affect their value. In the alternative, in lieu of the foregoing reduction, Employee may elect to waive any remaining Retention Payment by written notice to the PGE Vice President of Human Resources at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date of such Retention Payment, in which case Employee's award of said stock or stock options shall not be reduced. The foregoing provisions of this Subsection 3B shall not apply to any stock or stock options granted by any third party not affiliated with Enron.</P>
<U><LI>Term of Agreement</U>.</LI>
<P>The term of this Agreement shall be from the date first written above through the payment of the Retention Payment pursuant to Subsection 1B above; provided however, that the Termination Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A and the General Releases executed in accordance with Subsection 3A shall continue in effect; and provided further that this Agreement shall not constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a contract of employment for such term.</P>
<U><LI>Disposal of Rights.</LI>
</U><P>Neither the Employee, nor any person claiming under the Employee, shall have the power to anticipate, encumber or dispose of any right, title, interest or benefit hereunder in any manner or any time, until the same shall have been actually distributed free and clear of the terms of this Agreement</P>
<U><LI>Characterization of Payments</U>.</LI>
<P>In the event that Employee receives any Retention Payment pursuant to Subsection 2A, any severance that may also be paid to Employee pursuant to the Portland General Holdings, Inc. Involuntary Severance Plan at the time of such termination shall be reduced by an amount equal to such Retention Payment. The payments under this Agreement are neither intended nor should be construed as being additions to base salary or included in calculations of benefits, salary increase, or other bonus payments.</P>
<U><LI>Effect of Agreement on Certain Entities</U>.</LI>
<P>This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors to PGE and all persons lawfully claiming under the Employee. The parties agree that Enron shall have no obligation under this Agreement. Further, the Enron Retention Agreement shall be null and</P>
<P>void upon Employee's execution of the Termination Agreement. Enron shall be a third party beneficiary of the foregoing.</P>
<U><LI>Confidentiality</U>.</LI>
<P>This Agreement and any Retention Payments made hereunder constitute confidential information. Employee shall not disclose this confidential information to anyone other than Employee's immediate family, attorney, and tax advisor or as required by law. If Employee breaches this confidentiality requirement, PGE shall be entitled to recover from Employee any amounts paid to Employee pursuant to Section 1, as well as reasonable attorneys' fees resulting from PGE's efforts to collect such amounts.</P>
<U><LI>Choice of Law</U>.</LI>
<P>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, not withstanding any conflict of law principles, and without regard to the place of execution or performance of Employee's duties as an employee of PGE, or residence of the parties. Venue shall be a court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Oregon.</P>
<U><LI>Entire Agreement</U>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any prior employment agreements, replacement compensation agreements, retention agreements (including the Enron Retention Agreement), the Portland General Electric Company Retention Incentive Plan, as amended, and the Enron Corp. Sale Bonus Plan for the Sale of Portland General Electric Company, and contains all of the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</LI>

<LI>Any modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by each party whose rights hereunder are affected thereby, provided that any such modification must be authorized or approved by the Board of Directors of PGE.</LI></OL>
