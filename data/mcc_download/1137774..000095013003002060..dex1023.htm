in lieu of payments under her offer letter dated July 7, 1988, and Prudential&#146;s 1988 and 1989 Capital Accumulation Plans; and (2) a lump sum payment of $50,000, in lieu of outplacement services normally offered in accordance with
Prudential&#146;s practices. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">In exchange for
