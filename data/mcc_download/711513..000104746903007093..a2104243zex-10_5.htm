that BCC may make a representation in the Borrower Subsidiary Letter relating to each Credit Agreement, TBC certifies to BCC that TBC's Consolidated statement of financial position

the Consolidated financial condition of TBC and its Subsidiaries as of such date and the result of the Consolidated operations for such year, and since such date there has been no material adverse
