terms and conditions of this Amendment. In light of the foregoing, by executing
this Amendment, Guarantors further confirm and agree that all of the terms and
provisions of the Guaranty and the Guarantor Security Agreement are ratified and
reaffirmed, and that the Guaranty and Guarantor Security Agreement shall and
does continue in full force and effect. Although Bank has informed Guarantors of
the terms of this Amendment, Guarantors understand and agree that Bank has no
duty whatsoever to do so, nor to seek this or any future acknowledgment,

     executed in connection herewith, constitute the final agreement of the
     parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

          10. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions
     contained in this Amendment is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
     in any respect, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent
     of such prohibition or invalidity, and the validity, legality, and
     enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in
     any way be affected or impaired thereby.

          11. Interpretation. This Amendment and all agreements relating to the
     subject matter hereof are the product of negotiation and preparation by and
     among each party and its respective attorneys, and shall be construed
     accordingly. The parties waive the provisions of California Civil Code
     ss.1654.

          12. Counterparts. This Amendment may be signed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
     if all signatures were upon the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
     counterpart of the signature page to this Amendment by telefacsimile shall
     be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
     Amendment, and any party

                                       3

delivering such an executed counterpart of the signature page to this Amendment
by telefacsimile to any other party shall thereafter also promptly deliver a
manually executed counterpart of this Amendment to such other party, provided
that the failure to deliver such manually executed counterpart shall not affect

Amendment to Revolving Loan and Security Agreement to be executed as of the date
