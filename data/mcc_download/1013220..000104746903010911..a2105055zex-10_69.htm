Account under this Section will result in a suspension of the Participant's right to elect Salary Deferral Contributions under the Plan and to make pre-tax and post-tax
elective contributions under all other qualified and nonqualified plans maintained by an Affiliated Company ("Other Elective Contributions"). The suspension will continue for a period of
12&nbsp;months (6&nbsp;months effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, subject to Section&nbsp;18.06) following the effective date of the withdrawal. The aggregate amount of a Participant's Salary
Deferral Contributions to this Plan and the Participant's Other Elective Contributions in the Plan Year immediately following the Plan Year in which the hardship withdrawal is made will not exceed the
Code Section&nbsp;402(g) limit reduced by the amount of his or her Salary Deferral

Section&nbsp;401(a), that accepts the Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to the surviving spouse, an Eligible Retirement Plan is
an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective with respect to distributions made on and after January&nbsp;1, 2002, the following changes apply: (i)&nbsp;an Eligible
Retirement Plan also includes an annuity contract described in Code Section&nbsp;403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section&nbsp;457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of
a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state, provided the plan agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan and
(ii)&nbsp;in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, the limitation to an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity ceases to apply. This definition of eligible
retirement plan also applies in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the

shall be taken into account for purposes of calculating the Top-Heavy Ratio with respect to (i)&nbsp;a Participant who is not a Key Employee with respect to the Plan Year in question,
