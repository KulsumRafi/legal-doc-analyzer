      (b) Additional Duties.

            (i) In addition to the duties set forth in Section 1(a)(i), the
      Administrator shall perform such calculations and shall prepare or cause
      to be prepared by other appropriate persons, and shall execute on behalf
      of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee, all such documents, reports, filings,
      instruments, certificates and opinions that the Issuer or the Owner
      Trustee are required to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to the Related
      Agreements or Section 5.05 of the Trust Agreement, and at the request of
      the Owner Trustee shall take all appropriate action that the Issuer or the
      Owner Trustee are required to take pursuant to the Related Agreements. In
      furtherance thereof, the Owner Trustee shall, on behalf of itself and of
      the Issuer, execute and deliver to the Administrator and to each successor
      Administrator appointed pursuant to the terms hereof, one or more powers
      of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, appointing the
      Administrator the attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee and the Issuer for
      the purpose of executing on behalf of the Owner Trustee and the Issuer all
      such documents, reports, filings, instruments, certificates and opinions.
      Subject to Section 5, and in accordance with the directions of the Owner
      Trustee, the Administrator shall administer, perform or supervise the
      performance of such other activities in connection with the Collateral
      (including the Related Agreements) as are not covered by any of the
      foregoing provisions and as are expressly requested by the Owner Trustee
      and are reasonably within the capability of the Administrator.

            (ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Related
      Agreements to the contrary, the Administrator shall be responsible for
      promptly notifying the Owner Trustee in the event that any withholding tax
      is imposed on the Trust's payments (or allocations of income) to an Owner
      as contemplated in Section 5.02(c) of the Trust Agreement. Any such notice
      shall specify the amount of any withholding tax required to be withheld by
      the Owner Trustee pursuant to such provision.

            (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Related
      Agreements to the contrary, the Administrator shall be responsible for
      performance of the duties of the Owner Trustee set forth in Section 5.05
      of the Trust Agreement with respect to, among other things, accounting and
      reports to Owners; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall retain
      responsibility for the distribution of any Schedule K-1s necessary to
      enable each Owner to prepare its federal and state income tax returns.

            (iv) The Administrator shall satisfy its obligations with respect to
      clauses (ii) and (iii) above by retaining, at the expense of the Trust
      payable by the Administrator, a firm of independent public accountants
      (the "Accountants") acceptable to the Owner Trustee, which shall perform
      the obligations of the Administrator thereunder. In connection with
      paragraph (ii) above, the Accountants will provide prior to December 31,
      2003, a letter in form and substance satisfactory to the Owner Trustee if
      any tax withholding is then required and the procedures to be followed
      with respect thereto to comply with the requirements of the Code. The
      Accountants shall be required to update the letter in each instance that
      any additional tax withholding is subsequently required or any previously
      required tax withholding shall no longer be required.

            (v) The Administrator shall perform the duties of the Administrator
      specified in Section 10.02 of the Trust Agreement required to be performed
      in connection with the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee and any

            (vi) In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its other
      obligations under this Agreement, the Administrator may enter into
      transactions or otherwise deal with any of its Affiliates; provided,
      however, that the terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be in
      accordance with any directions received from the Issuer and shall be, in
      the Administrator's opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer than would be
      available from unaffiliated parties.

      (c) Non-Ministerial Matters.

            (i) With respect to matters that in the reasonable judgment of the
      Administrator are non-ministerial, the Administrator shall not take any
      action unless within a reasonable time before the taking of such action,
      the Administrator shall have notified the Owner Trustee of the proposed
      action and the Owner Trustee shall not have withheld consent or provided
      an alternative direction. For the purpose of the preceding sentence,
      "non-ministerial matters" shall include, without limitation:

                  (A) the amendment of or any supplement to the Indenture;

                  (B) the initiation of any claim or lawsuit by the Issuer and
            the compromise of any action, claim or lawsuit brought by or against
            the Issuer (other than in connection with the collection of the
            Contracts);

                  (C) the amendment, change or modification of the Related
            Agreements;

                  (D) the appointment of successor Note Registrars, successor
            Paying Agents and successor Indenture Trustees pursuant to the
            Indenture or the appointment of successor Administrators or a
            successor Master Servicer, or the consent to the assignment by any
            of the Note Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Indenture Trustee of
            its obligations under the Indenture; and

                  (E) the removal of the Indenture Trustee.

            (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
      Administrator shall not be obligated to, and shall not, (A) make any
      payments to the Noteholders under the Related Agreements, (B) sell the
      Trust Estate pursuant to clause (iv) of Section 5.04 of the Indenture, (C)
      take any other action that the Issuer directs the Administrator not to
      take on its behalf or (D) take any other action which may be construed as
      having the effect of varying the investment of the Holders.

      Section 2. Records. The Administrator shall maintain appropriate books of
account and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of
account and records shall be


                                       7

accessible for inspection by the Issuer and the Company at any time during
normal business hours.

      Section 3. Compensation. As compensation for the performance of the
Administrator's obligations under this Agreement and as reimbursement for its
expenses related thereto, the Administrator shall be entitled to an annual
payment of compensation which shall be solely an obligation of the Company.

      Section 4. Additional Information to be Furnished to the Issuer. The
Administrator shall furnish to the Issuer from time to time such additional
information regarding the Collateral as the Issuer shall reasonably request.

      Section 5. Independence of the Administrator. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the Administrator shall be an independent contractor and shall not be
subject to the supervision of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee with respect to
the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations
hereunder. Unless expressly authorized by the Issuer, the Administrator shall
have no authority to act for or represent the Issuer or the Owner Trustee in any
way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee.

      Section 6. No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
constitute the Administrator and either of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee as
members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate,
unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) be construed to impose
any liability as such on any of them or (iii) be deemed to confer on any of them
any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any obligation or liability
on behalf of the others.

      Section 7. Other Activities of Administrator. Nothing herein shall prevent
the Administrator or its Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its
sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity as an administrator for any
other Person or entity even though such person or entity may engage in business
activities similar to those of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee.

      Section 8. Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Administrator.
This Agreement shall continue in force until the dissolution of the Issuer, upon

hereunder by providing the Issuer with at least 60 days' prior written notice.

      (b) Subject to Section 8(e), the Issuer may remove the Administrator
without cause by providing the Administrator with at least 60 days' prior
written notice.

      (c) Subject to Section 8(e), at the sole option of the Issuer, the

      duties under this Agreement and, after notice of such default, shall not
      cure such default within


                                       8
<PAGE>

      ten days (or, if such default cannot be cured in such time, shall not give
      within ten days such assurance of cure as shall be reasonably satisfactory
      to the Issuer);

            (ii) a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a
      decree or order for relief, and such decree or order shall not have been
      vacated within 60 days, in respect of the Administrator in any involuntary
      case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now
      or hereafter in effect or appoint a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
      custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official for the Administrator

      effect, shall consent to the entry of an order for relief in an
      involuntary case under any such law, or shall consent to the appointment
      of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or
      similar official for the Administrator or any substantial part of its
      property, shall consent to the taking of possession by any such official
      of any substantial part of its property, shall make any general assignment
      for the benefit of creditors or shall fail generally to pay its debts as
      they become due.

      The Administrator agrees that if any of the events specified in clauses
(ii) or (iii) above shall occur, it shall give written notice thereof to the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee within seven days after the occurrence of such
event.

      (d) No resignation or removal of the Administrator pursuant to this
Section shall be effective until (i) a successor Administrator shall have been
appointed by the Issuer and (ii) such successor Administrator shall have agreed
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as the
Administrator is bound hereunder.

      (e) The appointment of any successor Administrator shall be effective only
after satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition with respect to the proposed
appointment.

      (f) Subject to Sections 8(d) and 8(e), the Administrator acknowledges that
upon the appointment of a Successor Master Servicer pursuant to the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Administrator shall immediately resign and such
Successor Master Servicer shall automatically become the Administrator under

deliver to the Issuer all property and documents of or relating to the
Collateral then in the custody of the Administrator. In the event of the
resignation or removal of the Administrator pursuant to Section 8(a), (b) or
(c), respectively, the Administrator shall cooperate with the Issuer and take
all reasonable steps requested to assist the Issuer in making an orderly

by the Issuer and the Owner Trustee and subject to the satisfaction of the
Rating Agency Condition in respect thereof. An assignment with such consent and
satisfaction, if accepted by the assignee, shall bind the assignee hereunder in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be assigned by the Administrator without the
consent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to a corporation or other
organization that is a successor (by merger, consolidation or purchase of
assets) to the Administrator; provided that such successor organization executes
and delivers to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an

      Section 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall
constitute but one and the same agreement.

      Section 16. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

      Section 17. Not Applicable to WFS in Other Capacities. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any obligation WFS may have in any other capacity.

      (c) In no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for any indirect,
special, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever,
including lost profits, even if the Indenture Trustee has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

      (d) In no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for any failure or
delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder because of circumstances

action, including any laws, ordinances, regulations, governmental action or the
like which delay, restrict or prohibit the providing of the services
contemplated by this Agreement.

beneficiary to this Agreement and is entitled to the rights and benefits
hereunder and may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.
