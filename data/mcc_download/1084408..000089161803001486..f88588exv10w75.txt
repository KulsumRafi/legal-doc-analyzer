         pursuant to Section 6. You will have overall responsibility for the
         management of Veritas worldwide financial affairs and operations and
         will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer of Veritas. You
         will be expected to devote your full working time and attention to the
         business of Veritas, and you will not render services to any other
         business without Veritas' prior approval according to its Conflicts of
         Interest Policy. You agree you will not, directly or indirectly, engage
         or participate in any business that is competitive in any manner with
         the business of Veritas. You will also be expected to comply with and
         be bound by the Company's operating policies, procedures and practices
         that are from time to time in effect during the term of your
         employment.

2.       Cash Compensation. Your cash compensation will include the following:

                  salary will be payable in accordance with Veritas' normal
                  payroll practices, with such payroll deductions and
                  withholdings as are required by law. Your base salary will be
                  reviewed on an annual basis by the Chief Executive Officer of
                  Veritas and may be increased from time to time, in the
                  discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of Veritas, subject

         balance, if any) to purchase a total of 700,000 shares of Veritas
         common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
         Veritas common stock on the date of such grant (the "INITIAL OPTION
         PRICE").

         (a)      These options will vest and become exercisable in accordance
                  with the terms of the stock option plan as follows: (i) the

                  shares underlying such option upon completion of the first six
                  months of employment (the "INITIAL PERIOD") and (ii) the
                  option shall be exercisable with respect to the balance of
                  such shares underlying such option at the rate of 1/48th per
                  month over the 42 months following the Initial Period. Except
                  as otherwise indicated in this Agreement or in

                                       2

<PAGE>

                  Veritas' stock option plan, the vested portion of such options
                  may be exercised at any time until the earlier of (i) 90 days
                  after the termination of your employment or (ii) ten years
                  after the grant of such options. You should consult a tax
                  advisor concerning your income tax consequences before
                  exercising any of the options.

         (b)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5 to the
                  contrary, upon an Involuntary Termination (as defined below),
                  a Termination without Cause (as defined below) or a
                  Termination for Death or Disability (as defined below), a
                  portion of the unvested options shall immediately vest as
                  provided in Section 8 below.

         (c)      Veritas shall register the shares issuable under the option
                  contemplated herein on a Form S-8 registration statement and
                  shall keep such registration statement in effect for the
                  entire period the options remain outstanding.

6.       Employment and Termination. Your employment with Veritas is "at-will"
         which means it is not for a specific term and may be terminated by you
         or by Veritas at any time for any reason, with or without cause as
         follows:

         (a)      You may terminate your employment upon written notice to the

         (b)      You may terminate your employment upon written notice to the

         (c)      Veritas may terminate your employment upon written notice to
                  you at any time following a determination by the Company that

                  "TERMINATION FOR CAUSE");

         (d)      Veritas may terminate your employment upon written notice to
                  you at any time in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive
                  Officer without a determination that there is Cause for such
                  termination (a "TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE"); and

         (e)      Your employment will automatically terminate upon your death
                  or upon your disability as determined by the Company (a

                  Cause, you will not be entitled to any cash severance benefits
                  or additional vesting of options.

         (b)      In the event of your Involuntary Termination or Termination
                  without Cause within two years of the Commencement Date, you
                  will be entitled to:

                           then current annual base salary [or a bonus based on
                           six months of on-target earnings], payable over
                           twelve months in accordance with Veritas' normal
                           payroll practices with such payroll deductions and

                           to the date of your termination of employment, or if
                           it is not possible for you to continue to participate
                           in the Veritas health care plans, Veritas shall pay
                           an amount to you so that you may purchase equivalent

         (c)      In the event of your Involuntary Termination or Termination
                  without Cause on or after two years of the Commencement Date,
                  you will not be entitled to any severance payments, continued

                  date of termination (ii) continued health care coverage on the
                  same terms set forth under Section 8(b)(ii) and (iii)
                  accelerated vesting of fifty percent (50%) of your outstanding
                  unvested options to purchase Veritas common stock, with all

         (e)      For purposes of this Agreement, Termination by Death or
                  Disability shall be treated as Involuntary Termination.

         (f)      If your severance and other benefits provided for in this
                  Section 8 constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning
                  of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
                  amended (the "CODE"), and, but for this subsection, would be
                  subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code,
                  then your severance and other benefits under this Section 8
                  will be payable, at your election, either in full or in such
                  lesser amount as would result, after taking into account the
                  applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the
                  excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, in your
                  receipt on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of
                  severance and other benefits.

         (g)      No payments due you hereunder shall be subject to mitigation
                  or offset.

         (h)      To the extent that Veritas shall provide to similarly situated
                  Veritas employees any other severance or other benefits in
                  connection with a Change of Control or otherwise, you shall be
                  entitled to such benefits to the extent such benefits exceed
                  these benefits granted and contained herein.

9.       Immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control and Act of 1986
         requires that all new employees submit proof of employment eligibility.
         Your employment with Veritas is contingent upon you providing proof of
         your right to work in the United States. Enclosed is a list of
         acceptable documents that will be necessary for you to show proof of
         your employment eligibility on your first day of employment.

10.      Indemnification Agreement. Upon your commencement of employment with
         Veritas, Veritas will enter into its standard form of indemnification
         agreement for officers and directors (which can be viewed in our most
         recent published proxy statement) to indemnify you against certain
         liabilities you may incur as an officer or director of Veritas.

11.      Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement. On the
         Commencement Date, you will be required to sign Veritas standard form
         of Proprietary Information and Invetntions Assignment Agreement, a copy
         of which is attached to this letter as Exhibit B, to protect Veritas'
         confidential information and intellectual property.

12.      No Solicitation. During the term of your employment with Veritas and
         for two years thereafter, you will not, on behalf of yourself or any
         third party,

                                       7

         solicit or attempt to induce any employee of Veritas to terminate his
         or her employment with Veritas.

13.      Arbitration. The parties agree that any dispute regarding the
         interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement shall be decided by
         confidential, final and binding arbitration conducted by Judicial
         Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") under the then existing
         JAMS rules rather than by litigation in court, trial by jury,
         administrative proceeding or in any other forum. The filing fees and
         arbitrator's fees and costs in such arbitration will be borne by
         Veritas. The parties will be entitled to reasonable discovery of
         essential matters as determined by the arbitrator. In the arbitration,
         the parties will be entitled to all remedies that would have been
         available if the matter were litigated in a court of law.

14.      Term. This Agreement shall be in effect upon the signing by both
         parties, and shall terminate upon the date on which you are no longer
         an employee of Veritas or until the parties mutually agree to its
         termination.

15.      Miscellaneous.

         (c)      Attorneys Fees. If a legal action or other proceeding is

                  connection with any of the provisions contained herein, you
                  shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and
                  costs incurred, both before and after judgment, in addition to
                  any other relief to which you may be entitled, to the extent

                  otherwise) will in advance assume in writing and be bound by
                  all of Veritas' obligations under this Agreement.

                PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND INVENTIONS AGREEMENT

This EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT when signed below by me, an employee of VERITAS Software
Corporation ("VERITAS") is my Agreement with VERITAS regarding inventions, trade
secrets, works of authorship, proprietary information, proprietary materials,
and other terms and conditions of employment (the "AGREEMENT").

In consideration of my employment or of my continued employment, with VERITAS, I
agree that:

1.       Either during or after my employment with VERITAS, I will not disclose
         to anyone outside of VERITAS, nor use other than in connection with
         VERITAS' business, except with the prior written permission of an
         officer of VERITAS, any invention, trade secret, work of authorship,
         Proprietary Information (as defined below) or proprietary materials
         that relates in any manner to any VERITAS actual or anticipated
         business, research, development, product, device, or activity, or that
         is received in confidence by or for VERITAS from any other person.
         "PROPRIETARY INFORMATION" includes but is not limited to inventions,
         marketing plans, product plans, business strategies, financial
         information, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists and any
         other nonpublic technical or business information which I know or have
         reason to know VERITAS would like to treat as confidential for any
         purpose, such as maintaining a competitive advantage or avoiding
         undesirable publicity. Examples of "inventions" include, but are not
         limited to, original works of authorship, formulas, processes, computer
         programs, databases, trade secrets, mechanical and electronic hardware,
         computer languages, user interfaces, documentation, marketing and new
         product plans, production processes, advertising, packaging and
         marketing techniques, and improvements to anything. Upon termination of
         my employment with VERITAS, I will promptly deliver to VERITAS all
         documents and materials of any nature pertaining to my work with
         VERITAS and I will not take with me any documents or materials or
         copies thereof containing any Proprietary Information.

2.       I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and
         my duties as an employee of VERITAS will not breach any proprietary
         information, invention, assignment or similar agreement with any former
         employer or any other party. I represent that I will not bring with me
         to VERITAS, or use in the performance of my duties for VERITAS, any
         documents or materials of a former employer or any other person that
         are not generally available to the public.

3.       During my employment with VERITAS, I will not engage in any other
         employment, occupation, consultation, or other activity relating to any
         actual or anticipated business, research, development, product, service
         or activity of VERITAS, or which otherwise conflicts with my
         obligations to VERITAS, without first informing an executive corporate
         officer of VERITAS about any such activity to ensure that all parties
         agree that no conflict exists. If new

                                       2

<PAGE>

         conflicts arise with respect to my obligations to VERITAS pursuant to
         Paragraph 10(d) of this Agreement, VERITAS agrees to advise me of such
         conflicts. The specific actions for resolving such new conflicts will
         be agreed upon after I have been advised of this conflict.

4.       I hereby assign and agree to assign to VERITAS my entire right, title,
         and interest in any Proprietary Information, invention, trade secret,
         work of authorship, or proprietary materials hereafter made or
         conceived solely by me or jointly with others and any associated
         patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secret rights, mask
         work rights, rights of proprietary and other intellectual property
         rights which:

         a.       were developed while working for VERITAS in an executive,
                  managerial, planning, technical, research, engineering,
                  development, manufacturing, programming, sales, marketing,
                  system service, repair, or other capacity, using equipment,
                  supplies, facilities or trade secrets of VERITAS; and

         b.       relates in any manner at the time of conception or reduction
                  to practice to any VERITAS actual or anticipated business,
                  research, development, product, service, or activity, or is
                  suggested by or results from any task assigned to me or work
                  performed by me for or on behalf of VERITAS, and

         c.       was not developed entirely on my own time.

5.       I have been notified and understand that the provisions of Section 4 do
         not apply to any invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of
         Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which states as follows:

         a.       ANY PROVISIONS IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDE THAT
                  AN EMPLOYEE SHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR
                  HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR HER EMPLOYER SHALL NOT
                  APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON
                  HIS OR HER OWN TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER'S EQUIPMENT,
                  SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR
                  THOSE INVENTIONS THAT EITHER:

                  (i)      RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO
                           PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION TO THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS,
                           OR ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR
                           DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPLOYER; OR

                  (ii)     RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR
                           THE EMPLOYER.

         b.       TO THE EXTENT A PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PURPORTS
                  TO REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO ASSIGN AN INVENTION OTHERWISE
                  EXCLUDED FROM BEING REQUIRED TO BE ASSIGNED UNDER SUBDIVISION
                  (a), THE PROVISION IS AGAINST THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE
                  AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.

                                       3

6.       In connection with any Proprietary Information, invention, trade
         secret, work of authorship and/or proprietary materials assigned or to
         be assigned to VERITAS pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Agreement:

         a.       I will, disclose promptly in writing all such Proprietary
                  Information, inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,
                  or proprietary materials upon conception, creation, or my
                  otherwise becoming aware thereof to my immediate superior,
                  with copies to the Senior Vice President of Engineering and
                  the legal department, whether or not they are patentable or
                  copyrightable or protectable as trade secrets or mask works,
                  that are made or conceived or first reduced to practice or
                  created by me, either alone or jointly with others, during the
                  period of my employment whether or not in the course of my
                  employment.

         b.       I will, at VERITAS' request, promptly execute a specific
                  irrevocable assignment of title to VERITAS, and do whatever is
                  deemed necessary or advisable by VERITAS to secure and
                  maintain for VERITAS a patent, copyrights, or other
                  proprietary interest in Proprietary Information, such
                  invention, trade secret, work of authorship, or other
                  proprietary interest in such Proprietary Information,
                  invention, trade secret, work of authorship, or proprietary
                  materials, and with respect to any associated patents, patent
                  applications, copyrights, trade secret rights, mask work
                  rights, rights of priority and other intellectual property
                  rights, in the United States and in foreign countries both
                  during and after my employment with VERITAS.

         c.       I hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to VERITAS any and
                  all Moral Rights (as defined below) that I may have in or with
                  respect to any invention. I also hereby forever waive and
                  agree never to assert any and all Moral Rights I may have in
                  or with respect to any invention, even after termination of my
                  work on behalf of VERITAS. As used herein, "MORAL RIGHTS"
                  means any rights of paternity or integrity, any right to claim
                  authorship of any invention, to object to any distortion,
                  mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory
                  action in relation to, any invention, whether or not such
                  would be prejudicial to my honor or reputation, and any
                  similar right, existing under judicial or statutory law of any
                  country in the world, or under any treaty, regardless of
                  whether or not such right is denominated or generally referred
                  to as a "moral right".

         d.       I acknowledge that any computer program, any programming
                  documentation, and any other work of authorship that falls
                  within the scope of sections (a) and (c) under paragraph 4 of
                  this Agreement is a "work made for hire," and that VERITAS
                  owns all the rights comprised in the copyrights for such work.

7.       I agree to make and maintain adequate and current written records, in a
         form specified by VERITAS, of all Proprietary Information inventions,
         trade secrets, works of authorship, proprietary information, and
         proprietary materials assigned or to be assigned to VERITAS pursuant to
         paragraph 4 of this Agreement; and upon the termination of my
         employment with VERITAS, I agree to surrender to

                                       4

<PAGE>

         VERITAS all such records and all other tangible items and evidence
         relating thereto.

8.       In further consideration of this Agreement, VERITAS hereby agrees that
         I may use VERITAS facilities, equipment and other resources for work on
         inventions and works of authorship, not coming within the provisions of
         paragraph 4, so long as these activities do not impact my work
         schedule, the work schedule of other employees, or otherwise amount to
         excessive use of such resources. VERITAS recognizes that my
         professional development and standing in the community of software
         developers is enhanced by such activity.

9.       Attached hereto as EXHIBIT A is a complete list of all inventions and
         works of authorship, if any, patented or unpatented, including a brief
         identification of all unpatented inventions and works of authorship
         that I made prior to my employment at VERITAS and which are to be
         excluded from assignment to VERITAS under this Agreement (the "PRIOR
         PRODUCTS"). I hereby certify that I have no continuing obligations with
         respect to assignment of such Prior Products to any previous employers,
         nor do I claim any previous unpatented inventions within the scope of
         this Agreement as my own, except those which I have listed below. I
         agree to not use VERITAS' Proprietary Information, proprietary
         inventions, works of authorship or information in making future
         improvements or revisions to these Prior Products, without the express
         written approval of a corporate officer of VERITAS.

         I hereby grant to VERITAS a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,
         royalty-free, worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, to use
         modify, copy, prepare derivative works of and distribute any VERITAS
         products that contain all or any portion of such Prior Product(s). I
         further understand that any improvements, whether patentable or not,
         made on the listed inventions after commencement of my employment by
         VERITAS are assigned or are to be assigned to VERITAS to the extent
         that such improvements are covered by the provisions of paragraph 4 of
         this Agreement.

10.      During my employment with VERITAS, I may add an invention to the
         invention list described in paragraph 9 in the following way:

         a.       I shall provide, in writing, a brief description and title of
                  the new invention to a corporate officer of VERITAS (the "NEW
                  INVENTION NOTICE").

         b.       A review period shall be provided for a new invention. The
                  review period shall start on the business day following the
                  receipt of a New Invention Notice by a VERITAS corporate
                  officer (the "NEW INVENTION REVIEW PERIOD").

         c.       During the New Invention Review Period, VERITAS may ask
                  questions, in writing, with regard to the new invention and
                  the provisions of paragraph 3. I agree to respond, in writing,
                  to all such questions. In addition, I agree that any delays
                  introduced by my response shall be added to the length of the
                  New Invention Review Period.

         d.       If a new invention comes within the provisions of paragraph 3,
                  and VERITAS provides written notice thereof, along with an
                  explanation, to me during the review period, then the new
                  invention shall not be added to the list of inventions or
                  works of authorship described by paragraph 7. If no such
                  written notice regarding a new invention is received within
                  thirty (30) days of the New Invention Notice, then the new
                  invention or work of authorship shall be excluded from
                  assignment to VERITAS under this Agreement.

11.      I understand that VERITAS, from time to time, may have agreements with
         other persons, companies or with the United States Government or
         agencies thereof which impose obligations or restrictions on VERITAS
         regarding Proprietary Information inventions, trade secrets, works of
         authorship, and proprietary materials made during the course of work
         under such agreements or regarding the confidential nature of such
         work. I agree to be bound by all such obligations and any applicable
         United States laws or regulations.

12.      I hereby authorize VERITAS to notify others, including but not limited
         to customers of VERITAS, or my future employers, of the terms of this
         Agreement and my responsibilities hereunder.

13.      In the event of any violation of this Agreement by me, and in addition
         to any relief or remedies to which VERITAS is entitled, I agree that
         VERITAS shall have the right to an immediate injunction, and shall have
         the right to recover the reasonable attorney's fees and court costs
         expended in connection with any litigation instituted to enforce this
         Agreement. I agree that any dispute in the meaning, effect or validity
         of this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the
         State of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions
         thereof. I further agree that if one or more provisions of this
         Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable California law,
         such provision(s) shall be excluded from this Agreement and the balance
         of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so
         excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

14.      "VERITAS" as used in this Agreement includes any and all subsidiaries
         and affiliated companies of VERITAS Software Corporation, and this
         Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any successors in interest or
         of any assignees of VERITAS.

15.      During the term of my employment and for one (1) year thereafter, I
         will not encourage or solicit any employee of VERITAS to leave VERITAS
         for any reason. However, this obligation shall not affect any
         responsibility I may have as an employee of VERITAS with respect to the
         bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel.

16.      Any dispute or claim, whether based on contract, tort, or otherwise,
         relating to or arising out of my employment by VERITAS shall be
         submitted by the parties to arbitration by the American Arbitration
         Association in the City of San Francisco, State of California and shall
         be subject to final and binding arbitration. The arbitrator shall have
         jurisdiction to determine any such claim, and may grant any relief
         authorized by law. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include
         costs

                                       6

         of arbitration, reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable costs for
         expert and other witnesses; provided however that nothing in this
         Agreement shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking
         injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from the courts as
         necessary. The parties shall be entitled to discovery as provided in
         the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California, whether or not
         the California Arbitration Act is deemed to apply to said provision.

17.      I understand that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of
         employment or obligate VERITAS to employ me for any stated period of
         time. I understand that my employment with VERITAS is "at-will", and
         may be terminated by VERITAS at any time and for any reason, with or
         without cause.

18.      I acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Agreement and agree that with
         respect to the subject matter hereof, it is my entire Agreement with
         VERITAS, superseding any previous oral or written communications,
         representations, undertaking, or Agreements with VERITAS or any
         official or representative thereof. This Agreement may not be modified
         or changed except in a writing signed by the employee and an officer of
         VERITAS.
