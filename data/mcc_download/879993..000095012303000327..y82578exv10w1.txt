during the term of the Development Program, furnish the JDC with reasonably
detailed, written reports on all activities conducted by DUSA in the Field
during such period in connection with the development and commercialization of
all products that contain the Compound as an active ingredient.

     4.5 Additional Development Efforts. The Parties recognize that each may
conduct research from time to time, outside the Development Program, resulting
in the discovery that the Product demonstrates utility for an Additional
Indication. The Parties may from time to time (but are not required to) and each
in its sole discretion, propose any such Additional Indication(s) for
development by the Parties within the Development Program, by submitting a
reasonably detailed report to the other Party. If the Parties determine that
such Additional Indication should be developed in the Development Program, the
Parties shall negotiate, in good faith, a budget and plan for development of
such Additional Indication(s). If within [ * ] days the Parties agree on a
budget for such development, the Additional Indication shall be included in this
Agreement [ * ] by either Party. If however the Parties are not able to reach
agreement on a budget and plan (including dispute resolution procedures) within
said [ * ] day time frame, the Additional Indication shall not be developed as
part of the Development Program and the proposing Party shall be free to
continue to develop the Product, as it chooses, for use in such Additional
Indication(s).

          4.5.1 Regardless of whether the Parties decide to include such
Additional Indication in the Development Program, PN shall notify and cause its
Affiliate, medac to, prior to the expiration of the [ * ] day time frame, advise
DUSA, in writing, whether or not medac will agree to supply Product to DUSA for
its development and commercial needs of any Additional Indication consistent

be responsible for maintaining such Registrations. Any such filings shall be in
DUSA's name and expense (or that of its Affiliates, Sublicensees or
distributors, as the case may be). DUSA shall also be responsible for obtaining
any export approvals required by the Regulatory Authorities to export Products
among the countries of the Territory.

     5.2 Ownership. DUSA or, where required by applicable law, its designees(s)
shall own any and all INDs, Registration Applications, Registrations and other
regulatory filings for the Product in each country in the Territory.

          5.2.1 On a semi-annual basis, DUSA shall keep PN informed as to the
status of all regulatory filings made pursuant to Section 5.1 and shall provide
PN with copies of all scientific or technical documents relating to the Product
filed with any Regulatory Authorities in the Territory in order to obtain or
maintain a Registration; provided however, that such documents shall be
considered DUSA Confidential Information and shall be used by PN solely in
connection with its regulatory filing obligations. These documents shall be
provided to PN, upon payment to DUSA of reasonable out-of-pocket handling and
shipping fees, in the language and format of the original filing and be subject
to the provisions of Section 7.4.3.

     5.3 Reimbursement of Costs.

          5.3.1 DUSA shall provide reimbursement funding to PN [ * ] as a result
of activities to be undertaken in support of DUSA's filing of an NDA for the
Product in the Field. Commencing upon the successful conclusion of PN's and/or
its Affiliates' Phase III Clinical Trials and the issuance of the final report,
unless PN's support is requested earlier, DUSA will reimburse PN as follows: (i)
[ * ] per calendar quarter for the first four (4) calendar quarters, (ii) [ * ]
per calendar quarter for the next following four (4) calendar quarters. [ * ].

          5.3.2 Payments of the amounts due under Section 5.3.1 shall be made
within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 5.3, in the event DUSA determines not
to file an NDA for any reason including, by way of example and not limitation,
that the Phase III Clinical Trials do not produce statistically significant
results, DUSA shall not be obligated to start paying, or may cease paying, as
the case may be the amounts set forth in Section 5.3.1, upon written notice to
PN and any amounts due for the quarter during which such a relevant event occurs
shall be made on a pro-rata basis.

     5.4 Adverse Reaction Reporting.

          5.4.1 Each Party responsible for clinical trials shall, with respect
to such trials, record, evaluate, summarize and review all adverse drug
experiences associated with the Compound and the Products. In addition,
supplemental information must be provided regarding the Compound and the
Products at periodic intervals and adverse drug experiences must be reported at
more frequent intervals depending upon the severity of the experience.
Consequently, each Party agrees to comply with the Drug Safety Agreement ("DSA")
attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 5.4; provided, however,
if there are any ambiguities or inconsistencies between the terms of the DSA and
the requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if the requirements of a
Regulatory authority are more stringent in any respect, then the provisions,
rules and regulations of the Regulatory Authority shall apply and the Parties
shall cooperate with each other in order that compliance occurs in a timely
manner.

     5.5 Investigation; Recall. medac shall permit representatives of the FDA or
other Regulatory Authority access to its records and facilities for any reason.

Regulatory Authority in any country shall allege or prove that the Product does
not comply with applicable rules and regulations in such country, each Party
shall notify the other immediately and both Parties shall cooperate fully
regarding the investigation and disposition of any such matter. If a Party is
required or should deem it appropriate to recall the Product and such recall is
due to any negligence, recklessness or wrongful intentional acts or omissions
by, or strict liability of, or breach of representation and warranty including,
but not limited to, non-compliance with cGMP, by the other Party, then and in
such event such other Party shall bear all reasonable direct costs associated
with such recall, including, without limitation, refund of the selling price to
end-users and the actual cost of conducting the recall in accordance with the
recall guidelines of the applicable Regulatory Authority. Otherwise, the
recalling Party shall bear all costs and expenses associated with such recall.

6.   GRANT OF RIGHTS; OBLIGATIONS.

     7.2 Obligation to Pay Milestones. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that in order to obtain a Registration, DUSA is required, or the JDC
determines, upon request of DUSA, (or, if DUSA is forced to exercise its
deciding vote) that it is necessary or desirable for Registration to conduct any
additional preclinical or clinical trials other than those set forth in the
General Development Plan in order to obtain or maintain a Registration, and DUSA
undertakes and pays for same, the costs of such preclinical or clinical trials
[ * ] shall be credited against the amounts due under Milestone Payment 2 or 3,
or refunded if applicable under Section 7.3. In the event that DUSA determines
not to undertake such additional clinical trials as stated in the first sentence
of this Section 7.2, and Milestone Events 2 and/or 3 as set forth in Section 7.1
above do not occur, no further milestones shall be deemed to have been met and
DUSA shall have no obligation to pay any such milestones. Finally, DUSA shall
have no obligation to pay Milestone 2 or 3 if any additional confirmatory
pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) is required, or the JDC determines, upon
request of DUSA, is necessary or desirable (or, if DUSA is forced to exercise
its deciding vote) to demonstrate statistical significance other than those set
forth on the General Development Plan, and such trial(s) is conducted by DUSA,
which trial(s) measure the same or comparable endpoint as the current Phase III
Clinical Trial (i.e., recurrent rate of disease at six months after the
resection procedure); provided, however, if DUSA does undertake such additional
Phase III clinical trial, then if (i) total patient enrollment occurs within
[ * ], measured from the date that the first patient is enrolled in such trial
to the date that the last patient is enrolled; and (ii) DUSA receives
Registration for the Product in the United States, then DUSA shall pay to PN
[ * ] in accordance with the terms of Section 7.1, instead of the amounts set
forth as Milestone Payments 2 and 3.

     7.3 Refund of Milestones Paid. In the event that Registration for the
Product in the U.S. is denied by the FDA, whose decision shall be binding, after
FDA's acceptance of the filing and payment by DUSA of Milestone Payment 2, PN
shall, within [ * ] days of receipt of written notice from DUSA of such denial,
refund to DUSA [ * ], as well as the costs of any additional preclinical or
clinical trials undertaken by DUSA as set forth in Section 7.2, [ * ], up to a
total of [ * ].

     7.4 Royalty Payments.

          7.4.1 As further consideration to PN for the license and other rights
granted to DUSA under this Agreement, during the Term of this Agreement, DUSA
shall pay to PN a royalty equal to [ * ] of the aggregate Net Sales by DUSA and
its Affiliates within the Field in the U.S. and Canada, which royalty shall in
no case be less than [ * ] per unit sold. For purposes of this Agreement, a unit
shall mean each [ * ] unit of Product for resale containing a [ * ] of the
Compound as the active ingredient.

          7.4.2 With respect to sales of the Product for use in any Additional
Indications proposed and accepted into the Development Program pursuant to
Section 4.3, DUSA and PN shall negotiate in good faith the development costs and
compensation to be paid by each party at such time as the Additional Indication
is accepted into the Development Program.

               (a) For purposes of clarification, no royalty shall be due PN on
Net Sales of Product sold for use in connection with any Additional
Indication(s) which has been developed by DUSA, either by itself, on its behalf,
or jointly with a Third Party or for use in the Barrett's Indication following
Registration, or any indications for which DUSA purchases Product pursuant to
the Supply Agreement other than for use in the Field.

          7.4.3 In the event PN uses any data from Phase II, Phase III or Phase
IV clinical trials conducted by DUSA in any IND or Registration Application for
marketing approval in a country outside of the Territory, PN shall pay to DUSA a
royalty equal [ * ] of the aggregate Net Sales of PN and its Affiliates in such
country, which royalty shall in no case be less than [ * ] per unit sold. Should
PN choose to file for Registration [ * ], the royalty shall be paid on Net Sales
of [ * ], provided that DUSA's data is necessary to obtain or maintain
Registration.

     7.5 Reduction for Generic Competition. In the event that a product that is
a Generic Product is being marketed by a Third Party or Parties in any country
in which a Party is selling the Product, the royalties payable to a Party under
Section 7.4 with respect to Net Sales of the Product shall be reduced based upon
the [ * ].

          7.5.1 The [ * ] calculation provisions set forth in Section 7.5 shall
be subject to [ * ] reconciliation, to be completed within [ * ] days of the end
of each [ * ] month period following the initial marketing of a Generic Product
in a country ("Generic Entry"). The total annual royalty payment due will be
determined by comparing actual aggregate Net Sales for [ * ] period after
Generic Entry to the aggregate Net Sales for the [ * ] period prior to Generic
Entry (the "Baseline") and by calculating [ * ] from the Baseline for such year.
In the event such reconciliation reveals an overpayment or underpayment to a
Party, DUSA or PN, as the case may be, shall pay to the other Party the amount
of the discrepancy within [ * ] days after determination of the discrepancy
amount.

     7.6 Obligation to Pay Royalties. There shall be no obligation to pay
royalties to a Party under this Section 7 on sales of Products between a Party
and its Affiliates, if any. The obligation to pay royalties shall arise only
upon the sale by a Party and/or its Affiliates to unrelated Third Parties, such
as end-users and distributors.

     7.7 Sharing of Operating Loss or Profit. The Parties intend to form a joint
venture to obtain Registration in the countries in the Territory outside [ * ].
In such event, DUSA and PN shall share, in accordance with the agreement entered
into between the Parties at the time of formation of the joint venture, the
costs [ * ] associated with commercial sales of the Product in such country.
DUSA and PN shall share, in accordance with the agreement entered into between
the Parties at the time of formation of the joint venture, [ * ]. In the event
that the Parties do not form a joint venture in any one or all of the countries
in the Territory outside [ * ], then the Parties agree to negotiate in good
faith [ * ].

8.   PAYMENTS AND REPORTS.

     8.1 Payments. Beginning with the calendar quarter in which the First
Commercial Sale is made in a country for which royalties are due under Sections
7.4.1 or 7.4.3 and for each calendar quarter thereafter, each Party shall submit
a statement, on a country-by-country basis, of the amount of Net Sales by such
Party during such quarter and the amount of royalties due on such Net Sales.
Each such statement shall be accompanied by the royalty payment due and shall be
submitted quarterly [ * ] days after the end of each calendar quarter. In
addition, payments to each Party of its share of operating profits and/or losses
which may be due under Section 7.7

Affiliates and/or Sublicensees to keep, complete and accurate records pertaining
to the sale of Product for a period of three (3) calendar years after the year
in which such sales occurred, and in sufficient detail to permit the other Party
to confirm the accuracy of the aggregate royalty calculations hereunder.

     8.4 Audit Rights.

          8.4.1 During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3)
years thereafter, at the request and expense of a Party, the other Party shall

certified public accountant appointed by the auditing Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Party being audited, at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice, no more than twice per calendar year, (unless required by an
unanticipated need from a tax or other government agency) to examine such
records as may be necessary to: (i) determine the correctness of any report or
payment made under this Agreement; or (ii) obtain information as to the
aggregate royalties payable for any calendar quarter. Said accountant shall not
disclose to the auditing Party any information other than information relating
to said reports, royalties, and payments. Results of any such examination shall
be made available to both Parties.

          8.4.2 Each Party shall bear the full cost of the performance of any
audit requested by it except as hereinafter set forth. If, as a result of any
inspection of the books and records of a Party by the other, it is demonstrated
that payments under this Agreement were less than the amount which should have
been paid, then all payments required to be made to eliminate any discrepancy
revealed by said inspection shall be made within thirty (30) days after written
demand therefor. Furthermore, if the payments made were less than [ * ] of the
amount that should have been paid during the period in question, the audited
Party shall also reimburse the auditing Party for all costs of such audit.

     8.5 Taxes.

          8.5.1 In the event that a Party is required to withhold any tax to the
tax or revenue authorities in any country regarding any payment to the other
Party due to the laws of such country, such amount shall be deducted from the
payment to be made by such Party, and such Party shall promptly notify the other
Party of such withholding and, within a reasonable amount of time after making
such deduction, furnish the other Party with copies of any tax certificate or
other documentation evidencing such withholding. Each Party agrees to cooperate
with the other Party in claiming exemptions from such deductions or withholdings
under any agreement or treaty from time to time in effect.

          8.5.2 If either Party has the legal obligation to collect and/or pay
any sales, use, excise or value added taxes, the appropriate amount shall be
added to the other Party's invoice and paid by the Party with such legal
obligation, unless the invoiced Party provides the Party with such legal
obligation with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
taxing authority.

9.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

     9.1 Ownership. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2, PN shall
retain all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology
regardless of which Party prepares and files the IND and Registration
Applications, subject to the licenses granted to DUSA pursuant to Section 6.

     9.2 Inventions.

          9.2.1 Rights to Inventions conceived or first reduced to practice
solely by employees and/or consultants of PN shall belong to PN.

          9.2.2 Rights to Inventions conceived or first reduced to practice
solely by employees and/or consultants of DUSA shall belong to DUSA.

          9.2.3 Rights to Inventions which were conceived or first reduced to
practice jointly by employees and/or consultants of PN and by employees and/or
consultants of DUSA, shall belong jointly to PN and to DUSA. The Parties shall
be under no territorial or field restrictions with respect to joint Inventions
and shall have the right to manufacture, have manufactured, use, sell, and offer
to sell such joint Inventions provided, however, that neither Party has the
right to grant or purport to grant any interest in such joint Invention to any
third party without the other Party's consent. To the extent not inconsistent
with an express provision of this Agreement, the laws of [ * ] shall apply to
the rights to Inventions.

          9.2.4 Each Party agrees promptly to provide to the other Party a
complete written disclosure of any Invention in the Field conceived or first
reduced to practice by such Party. DUSA shall determine whether any Invention
owned solely by DUSA or jointly by DUSA and PN is patentable and whether filing
a patent application is economically justifiable, and if so, DUSA shall proceed
with the preparation and prosecution of a patent application covering any such
Invention. If DUSA elects not to file patent applications for any Invention
owned jointly by the Parties, PN shall have the right to file and prosecute
patent applications for such joint Inventions in any country in which DUSA
elects not to file for patent protection. PN shall determine whether any
Invention owned solely by PN is patentable and whether filing a patent
application is economically justifiable, and if so, PN shall proceed with the
preparation and prosecution of a patent application covering any such Invention.

          9.2.5 DUSA and PN shall share [ * ]. The filing, prosecution and
maintenance of patents covering Inventions owned jointly by the Parties shall be
in the name of both Parties. If either Party elects not to pay for (i) the
filing of a patent application in a particular country on any such Invention
which the other Party reasonably believes is patentable, or (ii) the further
prosecution or maintenance of any Invention, or (iii) the filing of any
divisional, continuing, or continuation-in-part, patent application based on any
patent or Invention, such Party shall notify the other Party in a timely manner
and the other Party may do so at its own expense. In such event, such patent or
application shall be assigned by such Party to the other Party, and all of such
assigning Party's rights in such patent or application shall cease.

          9.2.6 Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party to execute
all lawful papers, instruments, and assignments, to make all rightful oaths and
declarations and to provide consultation and assistance as may be necessary in
the preparation, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of all such patents
and patent applications.

     9.3 Enforcement.

          9.3.1 If either Party learns of an infringement, unauthorized use,
misappropriation or ownership claim or threatened infringement or other such
claim (any of the foregoing, an "Infringement") by a Third Party with respect to
any Licensed Technology within the Territory, such Party shall promptly notify
the other Party and shall provide such other Party with available evidence of
such Infringement.

          9.3.2 PN shall have the first right, but not the duty, to institute
Infringement actions against Third Parties based on any Licensed Technology in
the Territory. If PN (or its designee) does not secure actual cessation of such
Infringement or institute an Infringement proceeding against an offending Third
Party within ninety (90) days of learning of such Infringement, DUSA shall have
the right, but not the duty, to institute such an action with respect to any
Infringement by such Third Party. The costs and expenses of any such action
(including fees of attorneys and other professionals) shall be borne by the
Party instituting the action, or, if the Parties elect to cooperate in
instituting and maintaining such action, such costs and expenses shall be borne
by the Parties in such proportions as they may agree in writing. Each Party
shall execute all necessary and proper documents, take such actions as shall be
appropriate to allow the other Party to institute and prosecute such
Infringement actions and shall otherwise cooperate in the institution and
prosecution of such actions (including, without limitation, consenting to being
named as a nominal party thereto). Any award paid by Third Parties as a result
of such an Infringement action (whether by way of settlement or otherwise) shall
be applied first to reimburse both Parties for all costs and expenses incurred
by the Parties with respect to such action on a pro rata basis and, if after
such reimbursement any funds shall remain from such award, they shall be
allocated as follows: (i) if PN has instituted and maintained such action alone,
PN shall be entitled to retain such remaining funds; (ii) if DUSA has instituted
and maintained such action alone, DUSA shall be entitled to retain such
remaining funds; or (iii) if the Parties have cooperated in instituting and
maintaining such action, the Parties shall allocate such remaining funds between
themselves in the same proportion as they have agreed to bear the expenses of
instituting and maintaining such action.

     9.4 Infringement Action by Third Parties.

          9.4.1 In the event of the institution or threatened institution of any
suit by a Third Party against DUSA for patent Infringement involving the sale,
distribution or marketing of the Product in the Territory, DUSA shall promptly
notify PN in writing of such suit. Unless otherwise covered by Section 11.2,
DUSA shall have the right to defend such suit at its own expense. PN hereby
agrees to assist and cooperate with DUSA, at DUSA's reasonable request and
expense, in the defense of such suit (including, without limitation, consenting
to being named as a nominal party thereto). During the pendency of such action
and thereafter, DUSA shall continue to make all payments due under this
Agreement.

          9.4.2 In the event that DUSA incurs any liability to a Third
Party for royalties or other damages as the result of any such action as
described in Section 9.4.1 for which PN has indemnified DUSA under Section 11.2,
DUSA shall be entitled (in addition to any damages which may arise under Section
11) to a credit against royalties due under this Agreement in an amount equal to
the damages, costs and expenses, including third-party royalties which may be or
become due. Any credit under this Section which is not applied in the period
incurred may be carried forward and applied to any subsequent period until the
credit has been fully applied.

COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS

10.  PUBLICATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

     10.1 Notification. Both Parties recognize that each may wish to publish the
results of their work relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. However,
both Parties also recognize the importance of acquiring patent protection.
Consequently, subject to any applicable laws or regulations obligating either
Party to do otherwise, any proposed publication by either Party shall comply
with this Section 10.1. At least forty-five (45) days before a manuscript is to
be submitted to a publisher, the publishing Party will provide the
non-publishing Party with a copy of the manuscript (or an English translation
thereof). If the publishing Party wishes to make an oral presentation, it will
provide the non-publishing Party with a copy of the abstract (if one is
submitted) at least forty-five (45) days before it is to be submitted. The
publishing Party will also provide to the non-publishing Party a copy of the
text of the presentation, including all slides, posters, and any other visual
aids, at least forty-five (45) days before the presentation is made.

     10.2 Review. The non-publishing Party will review the manuscript, abstract,
text or any other material provided under Section 10.1 to determine whether
patentable subject matter is disclosed. The non-publishing Party will notify the
publishing Party within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the proposed
publication if the non-publishing Party, in good faith, determines that
patentable subject matter is or may be disclosed, or if the non-publishing
Party, in good faith, believes Confidential Information (as defined in Section
10.4) is or may be disclosed. If it is determined by the JDC that patent
applications should be filed, the publishing Party shall delay its publication
or presentation for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the
non-publishing Party's receipt of the proposed publication or presentation to
allow time for the filing of patent applications covering patentable subject
matter. In the event that the delay needed to complete the filing of any
necessary patent application will exceed the ninety (90)-day period, the Parties
will consult in good faith to determine an extension of the publication delay
beyond the ninety (90)-day period. If it is determined in good faith by the
non-publishing Party that Confidential Information or proprietary information is
being disclosed, the Parties will consult in good faith to arrive at an
agreement on mutually acceptable modifications to the proposed publication or
presentation to avoid such disclosure.

     10.3 Exclusions. Nothing in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall prevent either
Party in connection with efforts to secure financing at any time during the term
of this Agreement: (i) from issuing statements as to achievements made, and the
status of the work being done by the Parties under this Agreement, so long as
such statements do not jeopardize the ability to obtain patent protection on
Inventions or disclose Confidential Information; or (ii) from issuing statements
that such Party determines to be necessary to comply with applicable law
(including the disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Nasdaq or any other stock exchange on which securities issued by
such Party are traded); provided, however, that, to the extent practicable under
the circumstances, such Party shall provide the other Party with a copy of the
proposed text of such statements sufficiently in advance of the scheduled
release thereof to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the proposed text.

     10.4 Confidentiality; Exceptions. Except to the extent expressly authorized
by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, the Parties agree that,
during the term of this Agreement and for ten (10) years thereafter, the
receiving Party shall ensure that their respective Affiliates, Sublicensees,
employees, officers, directors and representatives shall keep completely
confidential and not publish or otherwise disclose, and not use for any purpose,
any information furnished to it or them by the other Party or developed under or
in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to the Licensed
Technology, except to the extent that it can

be established by the receiving Party by competent proof that such information:
(i) was already known to the receiving Party, other than under an obligation of
confidentiality, at the time of disclosure by the other Party; (ii) was
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at the
time of its disclosure to the receiving Party; (iii) became generally available
to the public or was otherwise part of the public domain after its disclosure
and other than through any act or omission of the receiving Party in breach of
this Agreement; or (iv) was disclosed to the receiving Party, other than under
an obligation of confidentiality, by a Third Party who had no obligation to the
disclosing Party not to disclose such information to others (all such
information to which none of the foregoing exceptions applies, "Confidential
Information").

     10.5 Exceptions to Obligation. The restrictions contained in Section 10.4
shall not apply to Confidential Information that: (i) is submitted by the
recipient to governmental authorities to facilitate the issuance of
Registrations for the Product, provided that reasonable measures shall be taken
to assure confidential treatment of such information; (ii) is provided by the
recipient to Third Parties under confidentiality provisions at least as
stringent as those in this Agreement, for consulting, manufacturing development,
manufacturing, external testing, marketing trials and, with respect to DUSA, to
Third Parties who are Sublicensees or other development/marketing partners of
DUSA with respect to any of the subject matter of this Agreement; (iii) is
subject to publication rights by clinical investigators under agreements with PN
or medac entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; or (iv) is otherwise
required to be disclosed in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or
order by a court or other regulatory body having competent jurisdiction;
provided that if a Party is required to make any such disclosure of the other
Party's Confidential Information such Party will, except where impracticable for
necessary disclosures (for example, to physicians conducting studies or to
health authorities), give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such
disclosure requirement and, except to the extent inappropriate in the case of
patent applications, will use its best efforts to secure confidential treatment
of such Confidential Information required to be disclosed.

     10.6 Limitations on Use. Each Party shall limit the use, and cause each of
its Affiliates and its Sublicensees to limit the use, of any Confidential
Information obtained by such Party from the other Party, its Affiliates or its
Sublicensees, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, so that such use is
solely in connection with the activities or transactions contemplated hereby.

     10.7 Remedies. Each Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other right
or remedy it may have, at law or in equity, to an injunction, without the
posting of any bond or other security, enjoining or restraining the other Party,
its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees from any violation or threatened
violation of this Section 10..

11.  INDEMNIFICATION.

     11.1 Indemnification by DUSA. DUSA shall indemnify, keep indemnified,
defend and hold harmless PN and its Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against [ * ], whether in tort,
contract, or as a result of a breach of statutory duty or otherwise and whether
or not foreseeable [ * ] arising out of or resulting from:

          11.1.1 negligence, recklessness or wrongful intentional acts or
omissions of DUSA, its Affiliates or its Sublicensees, if any, and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents in connection with DUSA's
fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement; or

[ * ] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY
BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS
AMENDED.

          11.1.2 any breach of any representation or warranty made by DUSA under
Section 2.

          11.2 Indemnification by PN. PN shall indemnify, keep indemnified,
defend and hold harmless DUSA, its Affiliates, its Sublicensees and
distributors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents,
from and against [ * ] however arising, whether in tort, contract, or as a
result of a breach of statutory duty or otherwise and whether or not foreseeable
[ * ] arising out of or resulting from:

          11.2.1 negligence, recklessness or wrongful intentional acts or
omissions of PN or its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, in connection with PN's fulfillment of its obligations
under this Agreement;

          11.2.2 any breach of any representation or warranty made by PN under
Section 2; or

          11.2.3 any warranty claims, Product recalls or any tort claims of
personal injury (including death) or property damage relating to or arising out
of any manufacture, use, distribution or sale of the Compound or a Product by PN
or its Affiliates due to any negligence, recklessness or wrongful intentional
acts or omissions by, or strict liability of, PN or its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents, except, in each case, to
the comparative extent such claim arose out of or resulted from the negligence,
recklessness or wrongful intentional acts or omissions of DUSA, its Affiliates
or its Sublicensees, and their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents.

     11.3 Notice of Indemnification. In the event that any person (an
"Indemnitee") entitled to indemnification under Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 is
seeking such indemnification, such Indemnitee shall inform the indemnifying
Party of the claim as soon as reasonably practicable after such Indemnitee
receives notice of such claim, shall permit the indemnifying Party to assume
direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the sole right to
settle it at the sole discretion of the indemnifying Party, provided that such
settlement does not impose any obligation on, or otherwise adversely affect, the
Indemnitee or the other Party) and shall cooperate as requested (at the expense
of the indemnifying Party) in the defense of the claim.

     11.4 Complete Indemnification. As the Parties intend complete
indemnification, all costs and expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection
with enforcement of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall also be reimbursed by the
indemnifying Party. The parties agree that if any indemnification or
reimbursement sought pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2 is for any reason
unavailable or insufficient to hold it harmless (except by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party) then, the indemnifying
party shall contribute to the liabilities for which such indemnification or
reimbursement is held unavailable in such portion as is appropriate to reflect
(a) the relative benefits to the indemnified party on the one hand and
indemnifying party on the other hand, in connection with the transaction to
which such indemnification or reimbursement relates or (b) if the allocation
provided by clause (a) above is not available, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in such clause
(a), but also the relative fault of the parties as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations.

12.  INSURANCE.

     12.1 PN maintains and will continue to maintain during the period that it
conducts clinical trials, as sponsor, with the Compound, clinical trial
liability insurance of at least [ * ] in

the aggregate, at its cost. Similarly, DUSA will continue to maintain during the
period that it conducts clinical trials, as sponsor, with the Compound, clinical
trial liability insurance of at least [ * ] per incident and in the aggregate,
at its cost. Each party shall obtain by the date of the date of the First
Commercial Sale and shall continue to maintain, at its cost, , so long as the
Product is commercialized in the Territory and wherever sold in the rest of the
world, a general liability/product liability insurance policy providing coverage
of at least [ * ]. Both parties shall alternatively have the right to satisfy
the obligation for any insurance under this Section 12 through a reasonable
program of self-insurance. Both Parties shall provide written evidence of such
insurance coverage to the other Party upon request.

13.  TERM; TERMINATION.

     13.1 Term. This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date
and shall remain in full force and effect for a period of [ * ] years from the
date of receipt of the first Registration in any country in the Territory,
unless earlier terminated pursuant to one of the other provisions of Section 13
(the "Initial Term"). Following expiration of the Initial Term, the Agreement
shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year renewal periods
(each, a "Renewal Term"); provided, however, that at any time following
expiration of the Initial Term, either Party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement upon [ * ] days prior written notice. The Initial Term and all
Renewal Terms, or parts thereof, shall collectively be referred to as the
"Term".

     13.2 Termination by DUSA or PN. Notwithstanding the language contained in
Section 13.1:

          13.2.1 In the event that a Pre-NDA Meeting is not scheduled because,
based upon the final report, the Phase III Clinical Trial fails to produce
Statistically Significant Results, DUSA shall have the right, at any time, in
its discretion, to terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, based upon its
commercially reasonable judgment exercised in good faith, upon [ * ] prior
written notice to PN. It is understood that as used in this Agreement, the right
to terminate "in part" shall mean that a Party has the right to terminate this
Agreement on (i) an indication-by-indication basis, (ii) a country-by-country
basis, or (iii) any combination of the two (2).

          13.2.2 After the Pre-NDA Meeting with the FDA, DUSA shall have the
right, at any time, in its discretion, to terminate this Agreement, in whole or
in part, based upon its commercially reasonable judgment exercised in good
faith, upon [ * ] days prior written notice to PN.

          13.2.3 Subject to a decision of the JDC under Section 3.2.4, in the
event that the final report for the Phase III Clinical Trial is not completed
before [ * ], DUSA shall have the right, at any time thereafter, in its
discretion, to terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, upon [ * ] days
prior written notice to PN.

          13.2.4 After the Pre-NDA Meeting, if it occurs, DUSA shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, upon [ * ] notice to PN,
if the light device(s) used in PN's or its Affiliate's clinical trials and/or
approved for use with the Product in the Field cannot be purchased by end-users
on commercially reasonable terms (without regard to price).

          13.2.5 In the event that DUSA decides not to undertake any additional
pre-clinical or clinical trials as set forth in Section 7.2, either Party shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable
country in the Territory for which such additional pre-clinical or clinical
trials are required, upon [ * ] prior written notice to the other Party.

          13.2.6 In the event that DUSA fails to file a Registration Application
in the U.S. not later than [ * ]; provided, however, that the [ * ] time period
for filing in the U.S. shall be extended for additional reasonable periods of
time needed to respond to any requests from applicable Regulatory Authority for
information not prepared for submission to the Regulatory Authority at the date
of delivery of the final report mentioned above, or as determined by the JDC.

     13.3 Termination for Cause. Either Party (the "Non-breaching Party") may,
without prejudice to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity,
terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, in the event the other Party (the
"Breaching Party") shall have breached or defaulted in the performance of any of
its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall have continued for
[ * ] days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by
the Non-breaching Party (or, if such default cannot be cured within such
[ * ] day period, if the Breaching Party does not commence and diligently
continue actions to cure such default during such [ * ] day period). Any such
termination shall become effective at the end of such [ * ] day period unless
the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration
of such [ * ]day period (or, if such default cannot be cured within such [ * ]
day period, if the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently continued
actions to cure such default). The right of either Party to terminate this
Agreement as provided in this Section 13 shall not be affected in any way by
such Party's waiver or failure to take action with respect to any previous
default.

     13.4 Termination for Insolvency. Either Party may terminate this Agreement,
in whole or in part, as the terminating Party may determine, by written notice
to the other Party in the event that such other Party shall (i) have become
insolvent or bankrupt, (ii) have made an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, (iii) have been appointed a trustee or receiver of such Party for all
or a substantial part of its property, or (iv) have any case or proceeding
commenced or other action taken by or against such Party (as to which, if
involuntarily commenced against such Party, such Party not being able to obtain
dismissal within [ * ] days after commencement thereof) in bankruptcy or seeking
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, arrangement, composition
or readjustment of its debts or any other relief under any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar act or applicable law now or
hereafter in effect.

     13.5 Effect of Expiration or Termination.

          13.5.1 Following the expiration of the Initial Term of this Agreement,
or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 13.2.4, and 13.4, DUSA
shall have [ * ], to continue to market, distribute and sell Product in all
countries in the Territory, and the [ * ] right to use the Licensed Technology
in connection therewith; provided, however, that except as set forth in the
Supply Agreement, DUSA shall have no right [ * ]; and provided, however, if DUSA
receives approval to market the Product in the Field with a light device not

14.  FORCE MAJEURE.

     14.1 Events of Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable or
responsible to the other Party nor be deemed to be in default under, or in
breach of any provision of, this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or
performing any obligation of this Agreement when such failure or delay is due to
Force Majeure, and without the fault or negligence of the Party so failing or
delaying. For purposes of this Agreement, Force Majeure is defined as causes
beyond the control of the Party, including, without limitation, acts of God;
acts, regulations, or laws of any government; terrorism; war; civil commotion;
destruction of production facilities or materials by fire, flood, earthquake,
explosion or storm; labor disturbances; epidemic; and failure of public
utilities or common carriers. In such event DUSA or PN, as the case may be,
shall immediately notify the other Party of such inability and of the period for
which such inability is expected to continue. The Party giving such notice shall
thereupon be excused from such of its obligations under this Agreement as it is
thereby disabled from performing for so long as it is so disabled and the thirty
(30) days thereafter. To the extent possible, each Party shall use reasonable
efforts to minimize the duration of any Force Majeure.

which this Agreement relates), in the event of such Party's merger,
consolidation or involvement in a similar transaction or in the event of the
purchase of in excess of fifty (50%) of the voting securities of a Party by such
assignee. No assignment and transfer shall be valid or effective unless done in
accordance with this Section 13.2 and unless and until the assignee/transferee
shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.

     15.3 Books and Records. Any books and records to be maintained under this
