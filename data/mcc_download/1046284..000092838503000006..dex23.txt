limited by the availability of equitable remedies or by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally.

4.3.       Execution and Delivery.

           Neither the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or the
Time Brokerage Agreement nor the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will: (a) conflict with or result in a breach of
any provisions of Seller's organizational documents, (b) subject to the FCC
Order, violate any Law or Order of any court or Governmental Authority; or (c)
except as set forth on Schedule 4.3 hereto, violate or conflict with or
constitute a default under (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under), or result in the creation of any Lien on
any of the Purchased Assets pursuant to, any material agreement, indenture,
mortgage or other instrument to which Seller is a party or by which it or its
assets may be bound or affected.

4.4.       Governmental Approvals.

           No approval, authorization, consent, order or other action of, or
filing with, any court or Governmental Authority is required in connection with
the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or the Time Brokerage
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than those of the FCC.

4.5.       Title to Personal Property.

           Except for leased property, Seller is the sole and exclusive legal
owner of all right, title and interest in, and has good and marketable title to,

Sites, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

           4.6.2. Seller has valid, binding and enforceable leasehold interests,
which are free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens, in and to the
Leased Transmitter Sites and Studio Site.

           4.6.3. Seller has not received any notice of, and has no knowledge
of, any material violation of any zoning, building, health, fire, water use or
similar Law in connection with the Transmitter Sites or Studio Site. To the
knowledge of Seller, no fact or condition exists which would result in the
termination or impairment of access of the Stations to the Transmitter Sites or
the Studio Site or discontinuation of necessary sewer, water, electrical, gas,
telephone or other utilities or services.

4.7.       Tangible Personal Property.

           Schedule 4.7 sets forth a list, complete and accurate in all material
respects, of the Purchased Assets which consist of tangible personal property.
All of such tangible personal property, viewed as a whole and not on an asset by
asset basis, are in good condition and working order, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and are suitable for the uses for which intended, free from any known
defects except such minor defects that do not interfere with the continued
present use thereof by Seller.

4.8.       FCC Licenses.

           Schedule 2.1.1 lists and accurately describes all of the FCC Licenses
necessary for the lawful ownership and operation of the Stations and the conduct
of their businesses, except where the failure to hold any such FCC License would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has furnished to Purchaser true and
accurate copies of all of the FCC Licenses. Each such FCC License is in full
force and effect and is valid under applicable Laws; the Stations are being
operated in compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act, and
all rules, regulations and policies of the FCC; and to the knowledge of Seller,
no event has occurred which (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or
the happening or occurrence of any other event) is reasonably likely to result
in the revocation or termination of any FCC License or the imposition of any
restriction of such a nature as would have a Material Adverse Effect, except for
proceedings of a legislative or rule-making nature intended to affect the
broadcasting industry generally. The Stations, each of their physical
facilities, electrical and mechanical systems and transmitting and studio
equipment are being operated in all material respects in accordance with the
specifications of the FCC Licenses. The FCC Licenses are unimpaired by any act
or omission of Seller or any of Seller's officers, directors or

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

employees and, Seller has fulfilled and performed all of Sellers obligations
with respect to the FCC Licenses and has full power and authority thereunder. No
application, action or proceeding is pending for the renewal or modification of
any of the FCC Licenses. No event has occurred which, individually or in the
aggregate, and with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute grounds for revocation or non-renewal thereof.

4.9.       Reports.

           Seller has duly filed all reports required to be filed by any Law or
Order of any court or Governmental Authority and has made payment of all charges
and other payments, if any, shown by such reports to be due and payable. All
reports required to be filed by Seller with the FCC with respect to the Stations
have been filed. Such reports and disclosures are complete and accurate in all
material respects.

4.10.      Taxes.

           All Tax reports and returns required to be filed by or relating to
the Purchased Assets have been filed with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, and there have been paid all Taxes, penalties, interest,
deficiencies, assessments or other charges due with respect to such Taxes, as
reflected on the filed returns or claimed to be due by such federal, state or
local taxing authorities (other than Taxes, deficiencies, assessments or claims
which are being contested in good faith and which in the aggregate are not
material). Seller has not received any written notice of any examinations or
audits pending or unresolved examinations or audit issues with respect to
Seller's federal, state or local Tax returns that could adversely affect the
Purchased Assets. All additional Taxes, if any, assessed as a result of such
examinations or audits have been paid, and to Seller's knowledge, there are no
pending claims or proceedings relating to, or asserted for, Taxes, penalties,
interest, deficiencies or assessments against the Purchased Assets.

4.11.      Environmental Matters.

           4.11.1. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.11, with respect to the
Purchased Assets, Seller is in material compliance with all Environmental Laws.

           4.11.2. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth in Schedule 4.11,
no condition exists at the Transmitter Sites or Studio Site that is reasonably
likely to result in a claim under Environmental Laws, which would have a
Material Adverse Effect.

           4.11.3.    Except as set forth in Schedule 4.11, and except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, there are no
pending or,

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

to the knowledge of Seller, threatened actions, suits, claims, or other legal
proceedings based on (and Seller has not received any written notice of any
complaint, order, directive, citation, notice of responsibility, notice of
potential responsibility, or information request from any Governmental Authority
arising out of or attributable to): (a) the current or past presence at any part
of the Transmitter Sites or Studio Site of Hazardous Materials; (b) the current
or past release or threatened release into the environment from the Transmitter
Sites or Studio Site (including into any storm drain, sewer, septic system or
publicly owned treatment works) of any Hazardous Materials; (c) the off-site
disposal of Hazardous Materials originating on or from the Transmitter Sites or
Studio Site or the businesses or Purchased Assets of Seller; (d) any violation
of Environmental Laws at any part of the Transmitter Sites or Studio Site (i)
arising from Seller's activities involving Hazardous Materials, or (ii) to
Seller's knowledge, from the activities of any other Person involving Hazardous
Materials.

           4.11.4. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.11, and except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, Seller has been duly
issued all permits, licenses, certificates and approvals required under any
Environmental Law to operate the Purchased Assets as they are currently
operated.

           4.11.5. Seller has made available to Purchaser all environmental
assessments, reports, audits and other documents in its possession or under its
control that relate to the Transmitter Sites or Seller's compliance with
Environmental Laws with respect to the Purchased Assets.

           4.11.6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
Section 4.11 sets forth Seller's exclusive representations and warranties with
respect to the environmental condition of the Purchased Assets, Seller's
compliance with Environmental Laws, Hazardous Materials, Environmental Laws or
other environmental matters.

4.12.      Litigation.

           There is no Order of any court or Governmental Authority and no
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, judicial, administrative or otherwise
that is pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Stations.

4.13.      Contracts and Agreements.

           Seller is not in default in any material respect under any of the
Assumed Contracts, and, as of the Closing Date, Seller will have paid all sums
and performed in all material respects all obligations under the Assumed
Contracts which are required to be paid or performed prior to the Closing Date.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

4.14.      Business Records.

           Seller has, and after the Closing, Purchaser will have, the right to
use the Business Records included in the Purchased Assets, free and clear of any
royalty or other payment obligations.

4.15.      Third Party Consents.

           Except as set forth in Section 4.4, the only consents from any Person
which are required to be obtained by Seller in connection with the execution and
delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby are set forth on Schedule 4.15 (the "Third Party Consents").

4.16.      Finders and Brokers.

           Except for Jorgenson Broadcast Brokerage, the fees and expenses of
which shall be borne solely by Seller, no person has as a result of any
agreement entered into by Seller any valid claim against any of the parties
hereto for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment.

                                   ARTICLE 5.
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

           Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

5.1.       Organization and Good Standing.

           Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
power and authority to own and lease its properties and carry on its business as
currently conducted.

5.2.       Due Authorization.

           Subject to the FCC Order, Purchaser has full power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement and to carry out
Purchaser's obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement and the Time
Brokerage Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and each
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable
against it in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally or general equitable principles.

5.3.       Execution and Delivery.

           Neither the execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or
the Time Brokerage Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will: (a) conflict with or result in a breach of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser; (b) subject to the FCC
Order, violate any Law or Order of any court or Governmental Authority; or (c)
violate or conflict with or constitute a default under (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under) any material
agreement, indenture, mortgage, or other instrument to which Purchaser is a
party or by which it is bound or affected.

5.4.       Consents.

           No approval, authorization, consent, order or other action of, or
filing with, any court or Governmental Authority is required in connection with
the execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or the Time Brokerage
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than those of the FCC. No approval, authorization or consent of
any other Person is required in connection with the execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except as may
have been previously obtained by Purchaser.

5.5.       Finders and Brokers.

any valid claim against any of the parties hereto for a brokerage commission,

5.6.       Purchaser's Qualification.

           5.6.1. Purchaser is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to
be the assignee of the FCC Licenses, and no waivers shall be required by the FCC
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the grant of the
FCC Order. To Purchaser's knowledge, there are no facts or proceedings which
would reasonably be expected (a) to disqualify Purchaser under the
Communications Act or otherwise from holding the FCC Licenses, (b) to cause the
FCC to flag the FCC Application and/or initiate a review of the potential
effects on competition and/or diversity of the transaction, or (c) to cause the
FCC not to approve the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Purchaser.

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

           5.6.2. To the knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser shall not be required to sell, dispose of or surrender any FCC license
held by Purchaser or any such Affiliate with respect to any broadcast
properties, or any other properties or businesses of Purchaser or such
Affiliate, as may be required under the Communications Act or the antitrust laws
in order to consummate the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.7.       Financial Ability.

           Purchaser has, and on the Closing Date will have, cash available that
is sufficient to enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1.       Regulatory Approvals.

           6.1.1. No later than three (3) Business Days after the date hereof,
Seller and Purchaser shall jointly cause to be filed by Seller's FCC counsel one
or more applications with the FCC requesting its consent to the assignment of
the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Purchaser, which applications are
attached hereto at Exhibit A (the "FCC Application"). Each party shall pay its
own expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of the FCC
Application and shall share equally any filing fees associated with the FCC
Application.

           6.1.2. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing all things proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) obtain from any Governmental Authority or other Person any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or
Orders required to be obtained by Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR
License Sub to Purchaser; (c) furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including filings in connection
with the FCC Application, and to supply promptly any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested in connection with

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

such filings or applications; (d) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the
FCC Order, including defending against and opposing any lawsuits or other
proceedings (including any FCC reconsideration or review), whether judicial or
administrative, reviewing or challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the assignment of the FCC
Licenses from BCR License Sub to Purchaser; and (e) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to assign the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub
to Purchaser or to consummate any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of
the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Purchaser or the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any
Governmental Authority or other Person without the consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

           6.1.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order, the terms of
Section 6.1.2 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order becomes a Final
Order; provided, however, that such terms shall only survive as applied to
actions relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC Order becoming a
Final Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur prior to obtaining
the FCC Order.

6.2.       Third Party Consents and Notices.

           6.2.1. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Third Party
Consents and landlord estoppel letters with respect to the Leased Transmitter
Sites and Studio Site, in forms reasonably acceptable to both Seller and
Purchaser. All Third Party Consents shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, and none shall provide for any increase in cost or other change in
terms and conditions after the Closing which would be materially adverse to
Purchaser.

           6.2.2. If any Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to
Closing, and prior to Closing an Alternative Arrangement has been obtained with
respect to the Assumed Contract to which such Third Party Consent pertains (in
each case, a "Deferred Contract"), then Seller shall retain, until such time as
such Third Party Consent shall have been obtained by Seller, all rights to and
liabilities under the Deferred Contract. Until the assignment of the Deferred
Contract, (a) Seller shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts and
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller to obtain all required consents or
approvals to remove any other impediments to such assignment, and (b) Seller
shall cooperate with Purchaser (and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller) in
any lawful arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of
such Deferred Contract) that Purchaser shall receive the benefits of such
Deferred Contract after the Closing Date to the same extent,

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

and without any additional cost or expense to Purchaser, as if such Deferred
Contract had been assigned to Purchaser (such arrangement, an "Alternative
Arrangement"). To the extent that Purchaser receives such benefits, Purchaser
shall assume Seller's Liabilities thereunder arising on or after the Closing
Date with respect to such Alternative Arrangement and Purchaser shall perform
any such obligations of Seller arising under such Alternative Arrangement. If,
subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall obtain all required consents or
approvals required to assign any Deferred Contract, the Deferred Contract for
which consent or approval to assign has been obtained shall at that time be
deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, setover, assigned,
released, delivered and confirmed to Purchaser and assumed by Purchaser, without
need of further action by Seller or of further documentation except for notice
from Seller to Purchaser that such consent or approval has been obtained; and
from and after the effective date such Deferred Contract is assigned to
Purchaser, (i) no party shall have any further liability under the Alternative
Arrangement related thereto, and (ii) the Deferred Contract shall be deemed to
be an Assumed Contract.

     6.2.3. Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to third
parties which have entered into material contracts with any of the Stations
(other than the Assumed Contracts) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that Purchaser is not assuming
any obligations of Seller or the Stations in respect of the contracts with such
third parties. Seller shall promptly provide copies of these written notices to
Purchaser.

6.3. Access to Information.

     From the date hereof until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to Seller),
during normal business hours, Seller shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of Purchaser reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of Seller to the extent related to the
Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of Purchaser such additional information regarding
the Purchased Assets as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request in
order to assist Purchaser in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with
any of the businesses or operations of Seller or any Station.

6.4. Confidentiality.

     The terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of December 19, 2002
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Seller and Purchaser are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of
Purchaser under this Section 6.4 shall terminate; provided, however, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchased
Assets. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.

6.5. Public Announcements.

     Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party, issue
such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or
any listing agreement with a national securities exchange to which Seller or
Purchaser is a party if it has used all commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party and to obtain such party's consent but has been
unable to do so in a timely manner.

6.6. Ordinary Course of Business.

     Subject to the terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement and the obligations of
the parties thereunder, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing
Date, unless the prior consent of Purchaser is first obtained, Seller shall
cause the Stations to not knowingly take any action which would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of
the Closing Date.

6.7. Control of the Station.

     Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, control,
supervise, direct, or attempt to control, supervise, or direct, the operations
of the Stations; such operations, including complete control and supervision of
all of the Stations programs, employees, and policies, shall be the sole
responsibility of Seller until the Closing, except as contemplated by the Time
Brokerage Agreement.

6.8. Risk of Loss.

     Seller shall bear the risk of all damage to, loss of or destruction of any
of the Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.
If any material portion of the Purchased Assets (other than items that are
obsolete and not necessary for the continued operations of the Stations) shall
suffer any material damage or destruction prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall promptly notify

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction, shall promptly take all
necessary steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at Seller's sole
expense, and shall advise Purchaser in writing of the estimated cost to complete
such restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts actually paid as of the
date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that Seller is diligently
pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the Closing Date shall be
extended for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days to accomplish such
restoration, repair or replacement. If such restoration, repair or replacement
is not accomplished prior to the Closing Date, as the same may be extended as
provided herein, Purchaser shall have the right, at its option, to proceed with
the Closing and receive at the Closing the insurance proceeds or an assignment
of the right to receive such insurance proceeds to which Seller otherwise would
be entitled, whereupon Seller shall have no further liability to Purchaser for
such damage, loss or destruction.

6.9. Collection of Receivables.

     As of January 6, 2003 (the "TBA Date"), Seller shall assign the Accounts
Receivables to Purchaser for collection purposes only, and, within five (5)
Business Days after the TBA Date, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser a list of
the Accounts Receivables by accounts and the amounts then owing. Purchaser
agrees that during the term of the Time Brokerage Agreement and for a period of
one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing Date (the "Collection
Period"), without any requirement to litigate to collect the Accounts
Receivables, to use its commercially reasonable efforts (with at least the care
and diligence Purchaser uses to collect its own accounts receivable) to collect
for Seller the Accounts Receivables and to remit to Seller on the fifth day
following the last day of each month occurring during the Collection Period (or,
if any such day is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, on the next Business Day),
collections received by Purchaser with respect to the Accounts Receivables. With
each remittance, Purchaser shall furnish a statement of the amounts collected
and the Persons from whom such amounts were collected. Purchaser shall not make
any referral or compromise of any Accounts Receivables to a collection agency or
attorney for collection and shall not compromise for less than full value any
Account Receivable without the prior written consent of Seller. Any Account
Receivable not collected by Purchaser within the Collection Period shall revert
to Seller. Purchaser shall reassign, without recourse to Purchaser, each Account
Receivable and deliver to Seller, all records relating thereto on the same day
as it remits to Seller the collections received. All payments in respect of the
Accounts Receivables received during the Collection Period shall be first
applied to the oldest balance then due on the Accounts Receivables unless the
account debtor indicates in writing that payment is to be applied otherwise or
if the payment refers to a specific invoice or is evidenced by a payment amount
that is the exact amount of a later invoice. Purchaser agrees, upon the
reasonable request of Seller, to furnish to Seller periodic reports on the
status of Seller's Accounts Receivables.

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

Purchaser shall have no right to set-off any amounts collected for Accounts
Receivables for any amounts owed to Purchaser by Seller.

6.10. Time Brokerage Agreement.

      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser
are executing the Time Brokerage Agreement, whereby Purchaser will have the use
of substantially all of the airtime of the Stations. The Time Brokerage
Agreement will become effective as of January 6, 2003, and shall remain in
effect during the remainder of the term of this Agreement and shall terminate
upon termination of this Agreement or consummation of the acquisition of the
Purchased Assets by Purchaser hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, Seller shall not be deemed to
have breached or failed to comply with any representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements with respect to the Stations or the Purchased Assets if
such breach or failure is due or caused by any act, omission or instruction of
Purchaser under or in connection with the Time Brokerage Agreement or any
activities or transactions by Purchaser in furtherance thereof or in connection
therewith or any actions of Seller in accordance with the terms of the Time
Brokerage Agreement.

6.11. Cooperation With WXXY Owner.

      For a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date, Purchaser hereby
agrees, for the direct benefit of the holder of the FCC license for radio
broadcast station WXXY-FM, licensed to Highland Park, Illinois (the "WXXY
Owner"), to permit the WXXY Owner to have access to and use of the back-up
transmitters and generators located at the Leased Transmitter Site in Arlington
Heights, Illinois as necessary in connection with the business and operation of
WXXY-FM. Seller and Purchaser shall not amend the provisions of this Section
6.11 without the prior written consent of the WXXY Owner, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

6.12. Employee Related Matters.

      Purchaser and Seller agree that all employees of Seller are the
responsibility of Seller and Purchaser shall assume no Liabilities with respect

documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, at any time, prior
to, at or after the Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further
actions, and execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and
