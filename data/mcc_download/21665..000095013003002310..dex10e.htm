as directors of Colgate-Palmolive Company, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), to enhance the equity interest of directors in the Company, to solidify the common interests of its directors and stockholders, and to encourage the highest
level of director performance by providing them with a proprietary interest in the Company&#146;s performance and progress, by crediting them annually with shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the &#147;Common
Stock&#148;). This Plan shall supersede the Company&#146;s Stock Purchase Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, both of which shall terminate on the effective date of this Plan. </FONT></P><P

Plan shall remain in effect until December 31, 2006, unless sooner terminated by action of the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;). Awards outstanding as of the date of such termination shall not be affected or impaired by the
termination of the Plan. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">3.
<I>Participation.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Non-Employee Directors shall participate in the Plan. The term &#147;Non-Employee Director&#148; means any individual who is a member of the Board as of January 1, 1997, or who becomes a member of the
Board thereafter during the term of the Plan and in each case during such periods as he or she is not a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

undertaking, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that he or she will not publicly offer or sell or otherwise distribute the shares other than (i) in the manner and to the extent permitted by Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Act, (ii) pursuant to any other exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to an effective registration statement. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

Shares.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Each Non-Employee Director may make an irrevocable election on an annual basis to defer receipt of all or part of the shares granted under this Plan (the &#147;Deferral Election&#148;). In order to make a
Deferral Election pursuant to this Section 7(a), a Non-Employee Director must deliver to the Secretary of the Company a written notice of the Deferral Election setting forth the number of shares to be deferred on such form as may be prescribed by
the Committee. The Deferral Election may also specify that the Non-Employee Director elects to receive distribution of his or her Director&#146;s Trust Account (as defined below) in accordance with Section 7(c) in a lump sum (a &#147;Lump Sum
Delivery Election&#148;), or in installments over a period of less than ten years (a &#147;Specific Installment Election&#148;). The written notice of the Deferral Election must be delivered no later than the December 31 prior to the commencement of
the calendar year to which the Deferral Election relates. In the case of individuals who become Non-Employee Directors during a calendar year, this notice must be delivered within thirty days after the date on which the individual becomes a
Non-Employee Director. The Deferral Election made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall remain in effect for subsequent years unless a subsequent different Deferral Election is permitted and made in accordance with this Section 7(a). </FONT></P><P

Non-Employee Directors on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine (the &#147;Plan Trust&#148;), the assets of which shall be subject to the claims of the Company&#146;s creditors. All shares deferred pursuant to this Section 7
shall be delivered to the Plan Trust and shall be credited to the account of each Non-Employee Director in accordance with his or her Deferral Election (the &#147;Director&#146;s Trust Account&#148;), and held for delivery in accordance with the
terms of this Plan; and all earnings of a Director&#146;s Trust Account (including without limitation dividends on shares held therein) shall be reinvested by the trustee in Common Stock. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

Non-Employee Director (or, in the event of an eligible Non-Employee Director&#146;s death, his or her designated beneficiary) in ten annual installments commencing as soon as practicable following the cessation of his or her services as a
Non-Employee Director. However, if the Non-Employee Director has in effect a valid Lump Sum Delivery Election or a valid Specific Installment Election pursuant to Section 7(a), such distributions shall be made in a lump sum, or in the specified
number of installments, as the case may be, commencing as soon as practicable following the cessation of his or her services as a Non-Employee Director. Distributions will be made in shares unless the Committee otherwise determines, in accordance
with the terms of the Plan Trust. If such shares are to be distributed in installments, such installments shall be equal, provided, that if in order to equalize such installments, fractional shares would have to be delivered, such installments shall
be adjusted by rounding to the nearest whole share. If any </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

&#147;Unforeseeable Emergency&#148; means severe financial hardship to the Non-Employee Director resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Non-Employee Director or a dependent of the Non-Employee Director, loss of the
Non-Employee Director&#146;s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Non-Employee Director. A distribution pursuant to this paragraph may only
be made to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need, and may not be made if such hardship is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Non-Employee
Director&#146;s assets to the extent such liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship, or (iii) by cessation of participation in the Plan prospectively. The determination of whether and to what extent a distribution is permitted
pursuant to this paragraph shall be made by the Committee. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"

this Plan, in an amount not to exceed the amount needed to satisfy tax obligations related to the grant (the &#147;Cash Election&#148;), subject to and under the applicable rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the Employee
Relations Committee pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Plan. In order to make a cash election pursuant to this Section 8, a Non-Employee Director must deliver to the Secretary of the Company a written notice of the Cash Election setting forth the
amount of shares to be distributed in the form of cash. The written notice of Cash Election must be delivered no later than December 31 prior to commencement of the calendar year to which the Cash Election relates, or such later date as may be
permitted by the Committee and as permitted under Rule 16b-3. The amount of cash received pursuant to a Cash Election shall be equal to the mean between the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape (the
&#147;Fair Market Value&#148;) on the third business day following the date of the public announcement of the Company&#146;s annual sales and earnings multiplied by the amount of shares set forth in the Cash Election. </FONT></P><P

Subject to Section 9(b), each Non-Employee Director may make an irrevocable election to use all or a stated percentage (in increments of 25%) of his or her non-deferred cash compensation as a Non-Employee Director (including non-deferred retainer
fees as a committee chairman, if applicable, to be earned during the forthcoming calendar year and attendance fees earned during the current year) to have purchased Common Stock on his or her behalf (the &#147;Share Purchase Election&#148;). The
maximum amount of compensation that may be used by a Non-Employee Director in any year to purchase shares under this Plan shall not exceed $100,000.00. In order to make a Share Purchase Election pursuant to this Section 9(a), a Non-Employee Director
must deliver to the Secretary of the Company a written notice setting forth the percentage (in increments of 25%) of the Non-Employee Director&#146;s total non-deferred cash compensation to be used to purchase Common Stock of the Company. All shares
of Common Stock of the Company purchased pursuant to this Section must be held at least until six months have elapsed from the date of such purchase. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P
