Dear Sirs:

Re:       Drucker, Inc. ("Drucker")
          and Crime Prevention Analysis Lab Inc. ("CPAL")

         Further to our discussions today with respect to Drucker's interest in
acquiring CPAL, the following outlines the general terms and conditions pursuant
to which Drucker shall purchase all the interests of CPAL. In the event that
CPAL accepts this offer, as provided herein, the parties shall enter into a
definitive agreement (the "Definitive Agreement") which shall, among other
things, provide for the following key terms and conditions:

        o        Drucker will issue up to 10,000 convertible debentures to CPAL
                 for up to 100% of CPAL with a minimum take-up of 60% of CPAL.
                 Features of the debenture are as follows:
                        o       Each debenture is convertible into 3,075 shares
                                of Drucker common share.
                        o       The debenture will pay no interest.
                        o       The debenture is redeemable in whole by Drucker
                                any time until March 31, 2003.
                        o       The debenture is not convertible for 90 days
                                (January 1, 2003 to April 1, 2003).
                        o       Thereafter according to an agreed formula.
                        o       The debenture will have a floating charge on
                                CPAL only.

        o       Drucker will immediately initiate the steps necessary to
                increase the authorized shares from 50 million to 200 million.

        o       CPAL will ensure that sales and marketing efforts are accelerat-
                ed during this 3 month period.

        o       CPAL agrees that liabilities and other indebtedness to share-
                holders and employees carried on the December 15, 2002 Financial
                Statements shall be repaid subject to availability of cash.

        o       CPAL will provide a list of all rights and patents it owns; as
                well contracts and agreements, etc in the company.

        o       Drucker has 5,542,065 "A" Share Purchase Warrants exercisable at
                $US 0.40 each. Upon exercise, each Warrant will entitle purchas-
                er to receive one Drucker share and another Warrant exercisable
                at US$0.60. Drucker will use these warrants as major source of
                financing to fund CPAL's growth.

        o       This agreement is effective January 1, 2003.

        o       CPAL will represent and warrant to Drucker as set out in
                Appendix 1.

        o       This agreement is subject to Board approval from both parties.

         Except as may be required by a stock exchange or other trading facility
or by any rule, regulation or law of any kind whatsoever which is applicable to
any party, while this letter agreement is in effect and for a period of one year
thereafter, each party shall keep confidential all discussions and
communications between them including, without limitation, all information
communicated therein and all written and printed materials of any kind
whatsoever exchanged between them.

         We acknowledge that upon acceptance by CPAL, this letter agreement will
constitute a binding agreement between the parties. Either party may request
that the Definitive Agreement including the terms of this letter agreement and
such other representations, warranties, terms and conditions as are generally
accepted in the Industry be entered into, but until such definitive agreement is
executed and delivered by all parties, this letter agreement will prevail.


Yours very truly,
DRUCKER, INC.

director, employee or shareholder of the Company.


 The Vendors hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Purchaser
as follows that:

   (a) the Vendors have the capacity to protect their own interests in
connection with the acquisition of the common shares of the Purchaser and are
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Purchaser by
reason of their business and financial knowledge and experience;

<PAGE>

   (b) the Vendors are acquiring the convertible debentures of the Purchaser for
investment for their own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof. The Vendors
understand that when the convertible debentures are converted into common shares
the shares of common stock of the Purchaser have not been, and will not be,
registered under the US Securities Act 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act, the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the
bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of the Vendors'
representations as expressed herein;

   (c) each Vendor acknowledges that the shares of common stock of the Purchaser
must be held unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless
an exemption from such registration is available. Each Vendor is aware of the
restrictions and limitations on resale of the shares of common stock of the
Purchaser into the United States or to a US Person pursuant to the provisions of
Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. In addition, each Vendor is
aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule
144") which permit limited resales in the US of shares purchased in a private
placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among
other things, the existence of a public market for the shares of common stock of
the Purchaser, the availability of certain current public information about the
Purchaser, the resale occurring not less than one year after a party has
purchased and paid for the security to be sold, the sale being effected through
a "broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a "market maker" and
the number of shares being sold during any three-month period not exceeding
specified limitations;



   (d) each Vendor also acknowledges that the shares of common stock of the
Purchaser must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the
Securities Act (British Columbia) (the "BC Act") or unless an exemption from
such registration is available. Each Vendor is aware that the shares of common
stock of the Purchaser are subject to restriction on transferability and resale
and may not be transferred or resold in British Columbia or to British Columbia
residents except as permitted by the Securities Act (British Columbia) (the "BC
Act") and Regulations made under the BC Act;

   (e) each of the Vendors has had an opportunity to discuss the Purchaser's
business, management and financial affairs with the Company's management and has
also had an opportunity to ask questions of the Purchaser's officers, which
questions were answered to the Vendors' satisfaction. Each Vendor has been
furnished with or has had access to such information as a sophisticated investor
would customarily require to evaluate the merits and risks of the proposed
investment together with such additional information as is necessary to verify
the accuracy of the information supplied. The Vendors represent and acknowledge
that they have been solely responsible for their own due-diligence investigation
of the Purchaser and its management and business, for their own analysis of the
merits and risks of this investment, and for their own analysis of the terms of
the investment, and that in taking any action or performing any role relative to
the proposed investment, they have acted solely in their own interest, and that
neither they nor any of their agents or employees has acted as an agent,
employee, partner or fiduciary of any other person, or as an agent of the
Purchaser, or as an issuer, underwriter, broker, dealer or investment advisor
relative to this investment;

<PAGE>

   (f) each of the Vendors understands that the Purchaser has limited operating
history and is in the process of transferring its current business assets and
liabilities as referred to in Section 12(p) and Section 12(q) of this Agreement,
and that investment in the Purchaser involves substantial risks. The Vendors
further understand that the acquisition of the shares of common stock of the
Purchaser will be a highly speculative investment. Each of the Vendors is able,
without impairing his financial condition, to hold the shares of common stock of
the Purchaser for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of
his investment;

   (g) each of the Vendors agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
and its officers, directors and agents for any costs, liabilities or losses
caused by any misstatement of material fact by such Vendor with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in this Section or any other written
information provided to the Purchaser by such Vendor in connection with the
investment contemplated by this Agreement.
