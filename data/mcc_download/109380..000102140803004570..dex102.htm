size=2>The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (&#147;Plan&#148;) is to provide Directors of Zions Bancorporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Directors of subsidiary companies with an opportunity to defer compensation paid to
them for their services as Directors until their retirement from the Board of Directors.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>2.</font><font

size=2>Subject to the conditions specified in this Plan or otherwise set by the Executive Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, all Directors, including senior Directors, of the Company who receive compensation for their service as
Directors are eligible to participate in the Plan. Eligible directors are referred to as &#147;Directors&#148; and participating directors are referred to as &#147;Participants&#148; in this Plan.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;

text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Executive Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors shall administer the Plan and shall have full authority to make such rules and regulations deemed necessary or desirable to administer
the Plan and to interpret its provisions.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>4.</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><u><font size=2>Election to Defer

make an election to defer specified amounts of his compensation at or prior to the effective date of this Plan and can only make an election as to compensation to be paid for future services. For subsequent years of the Plan, a Director can elect to

calendar year. A newly elected Director may make a choice within five days of the date of his election to serve as a Director to defer payment of compensation for future service. An election shall continue in effect until the termination of the
Participant&#146;s service as a Director or until the end of the calendar year during which the Director serves written notice of the discontinuance of his election.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in;
margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>All notices of election, change of election, or discontinuance of election shall be made on forms prepared by the Corporate Secretary and shall be dated, signed, and filed with the Corporate Secretary. A notice of
change of election or discontinuance of election shall operate prospectively from the beginning of the calendar year, but any compensation deferred shall continue to be held and shall be paid in accordance with the notice of election under which it
was withheld.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Deferral. A Participant may elect to defer receipt of all or a specified portion of the
compensation payable to him for serving as a Director and attending Board and committee meetings as a Director. For purposes of this Plan, compensation does not include any funds paid to a Director to reimburse him for expenses.</font></p> <p

receive the deferred compensation in a lump-sum payment within 45 days following the end of his service as a Director or in a number of annual installments (not to exceed four), the first of which would be payable within 45 days following the end of
his service as a Director with each subsequent payment payable one year thereafter. Under an installment payout, the </font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center'><font size=2>

of the calendar month preceding such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments selected. The amount of each subsequent payment shall be a fraction of the balance in the Participant&#146;s
Account as of the last day of the calendar month preceding each subsequent payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments elected minus the number of installments previously paid. The term
&#147;balance,&#148; as used herein, refers to the amount credited to a Participant&#146;s Account or to the Fair Market Value [as defined in Section 5(a)] of the phantom shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock credited to his Account. The most
recently filed election as to payment will be used to determine the method in which all deferred compensation balances will be paid out to the Participant or his beneficiary. In no event shall cash be delivered to a Participant in respect of any
amount deferred hereunder as a Phantom Stock Option or any amount of dividends earlier than six months following the date of deferral of such amount, and any such amount required to be paid under any provision of this agreement shall be paid only
after the lapse of any such six-month period, except to the extent that such amount is payable after the death, retirement, disability or complete termination of employment of the Director in all capacities with the Company or its
subsidiaries.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantom Stock Option and Unsecured Note Option. When making an election to defer all or a specified
