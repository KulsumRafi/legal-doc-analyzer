3.       Article 7 of this Plan is hereby amended as follows:

         "Article 7 - Plan Administrator's Interpretation Binding

                  Metropolitan Life Insurance Company shall be the Plan
         Administrator with respect to this Plan. The Plan Administrator is
         empowered to take all actions it deems appropriate in administering
         this Plan. The Plan Administrator will develop, and distribute on
         request by a Plan Participant, claim procedures for obtaining benefits
         under this plan. These procedures will comply with applicable ERISA
         regulations.

                  In the event of a difference of opinion between a Participant
         and the Plan Administrator with respect to the meaning or application
         of the provisions of the Plan, the Plan Administrator's final
         interpretation shall be set forth in writing to the Participant and
         shall be binding and conclusive. However, once a Change of Control (as
         defined in Article 10) has occurred, this Article 7 shall no longer
         apply to differences of opinion between the Plan Administrator and a
         Participant

                                       2

         regarding the application of Article 10 of this Plan to a Participant
         or with regard to any rights or benefits protected under Article 10 of
         this Plan or otherwise accrued prior to the Change of Control including
         the vesting thereof."

4.       Article 9 of the Plan is hereby amended as follows:

         "Article 9 - Amendment and Termination of Plan

         9.1      Amendment of Plan. The Plan Administrator reserves the right
         to amend this Plan on behalf of the Company, without the consent of any
         Participant or of any other person. However, any such amendment will
         not affect adversely the entitlement to benefits hereunder of any
         Participant or Participant receiving benefits under the Plan or any
         successor plan at or prior to the time of such amendment or of an
         employee who is a Participant in the Savings and Investment Plan at or
         prior to the time of such amendment to the extent such benefits are
         attributable to Company service prior to the date of such amendment.
         Notwithstanding the above, any amendment or group of amendments made
         effective on the same date, which would increase or decrease the annual
         cost of Plan benefits for active Plan Participants and former Plan
         Participants by ten million dollars or more in the aggregate, as
         determined in good faith by the Plan Administrator, shall take effect
         as to each Company that authorizes or ratifies such amendment or group
         of amendments (as the case may be) in the manner set forth in clause
         (a) or (b) below:

                  (a)      With respect to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,
         the action is authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors of
         Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and

<PAGE>

                  (b)      With respect to any Company other than Metropolitan
         Life Insurance Company, the action is authorized or ratified by an
         authorized officer of such Company.

         9.2      Effect of Change of Control on Power to Amend or Terminate
         Plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.1 above, or any other
         provision of this plan, on or after a Change of Control (as defined in
         Article 10), amendments can no longer be made to Article 7, Section 9.2
         of Article 9 or Article 10 of this Plan; and

         Participants who:

                  (i)  accrued rights or benefits under this Plan prior to a
         Change of Control (as defined in Article 10), and,

                  (ii) whose rights or benefits are not vested at the time of
         the Change of Control

         cannot have the vesting schedule, applicable on the day prior to the
         Change of Control, amended with regard to such rights or benefits, and
         cannot forfeit, or be deprived of, their right to vest in these accrued
         benefits due to any amendment or termination of this Plan."

         9.3      Termination of Plan. The Company reserves the right to
         terminate this Plan hereunder at any time without the consent of any
         Participant or of any other person. However, any such termination will
         not affect adversely the entitlement to benefits hereunder of any
         Participant or Participant receiving benefits under the Plan or any
         successor plan at or prior to the time of such termination or of an
         employee who is a Participant in the Savings and Investment Plan at or
         prior to

                                       4

         the time of such termination to the extent such benefits are
         attributable to Company service prior to the date of such termination."

         10.2.    Vesting and Other Rights on and After a Change of Control
         Subject to Conditions

         before the second anniversary of the Change of Control, a Participant
         in this Plan:

                  Corporation or any Affiliate) without Cause,

                           (ii)     voluntarily terminates employment with the
                  Corporation or any Affiliate for Good Reason,

         Control in each, the Savings and Investment Plan and this Plan, will
         vest immediately under this Plan, notwithstanding any other provision
         of the Savings and Investment Plan or this Plan, or any amendment or
         termination of this Plan taking place on or after a Change of Control.

         prior to the Change of Control. "
