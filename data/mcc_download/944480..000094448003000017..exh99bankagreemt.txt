                                    RECITALS

     Pursuant to the terms of a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March
23, 2000, as Amended pursuant to a First Modification Agreement dated as of May

Agreement dated as of January 14, 2002, and various letter agreements executed
from time to time (the aforesaid Loan and Security Agreement, as amended from
time to time, "LOAN AGREEMENT") by and between the BORROWERS and the NATIONAL
BANK OF CANADA ("NBOC"), NBOC provided a credit facility to the BORROWERS in the
originally stated maximum principal amount of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00). On or about January 15, 20002, NBOC transferred to the LENDER
all of its right, title, and interest in, to and under the LOAN AGREEMENT and
the credit facility extended to the BORROWERS pursuant thereto.

     All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
same meaning herein as in the LOAN AGREEMENT.

     The GUARANTORS have guaranteed all of the BORROWERS' obligations to the
LENDER pursuant to Guaranty Agreements dated as of March 23, 2000.

     GP STRATEGIES has guaranteed all of the BORROWERS' obligations to the
LENDER (subject to certain limitations set forth therein) pursuant to a Limited
Guaranty Agreement dated as of March 23, 2000.

     MANTECH presently provides certain subordinated loans to GSE SYSTEMS as set
forth in the Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement dated as of June 25, 2001
between MANTECH and the LENDER.

     The CREDIT FACILITY is secured by, among other things, the security
interests and liens granted by the BORROWERS and the GUARANTORS to the LENDER
pursuant to the LOAN AGREEMENT and the other LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     The BORROWERS are in default under the LOAN AGREEMENT as a result of
violations of Sections 6.21, 6.22 and 6.24 of the LOAN AGREEMENT as of their
FISCAL YEAR ending December 31, 2002 ("EXISTING DEFAULTS"). As a result of the
occurrence of the EXISTING DEFAULTS, the LENDER may terminate the CREDIT
FACILITY and accelerate the time for payment of the OBLIGATIONS and exercise its
rights and remedies upon default. Notwithstanding the EXISTING DEFAULTS, the
LENDER is continuing to provide advances under the LOAN and has not, as of the
date hereof, demanded repayment of any sums under the CREDIT FACILITY.

     The BORROWERS have requested that the LENDER extend the TERMINATION DATE
under the LOAN AGREEMENT to March 31, 2004 and to otherwise modify certain terms
of the LOAN AGREEMENT. The BORROWERS have also requested that the LENDER waive
the EXISTING DEFAULTS.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     Section 1. Recitals. The parties acknowledge the accuracy of the above
Recitals and hereby incorporate the Recitals into this MODIFICATION.

     Section 2. LIBOR Borrowing under the Loan Agreement. The BORROWERS agree
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the LOAN AGREEMENT,
henceforth the BORROWERS shall not make elections for LIBOR BORROWINGS or
otherwise elect to accrue interest at the ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE, and the LENDER
shall have no obligation to make any advances under the CREDIT FACILITY as LIBOR
BORROWINGS.

     Section 3. Amendment To Loan Agreement. The LOAN AGREEMENT is hereby
amended and modified as follows:

     a.   Section 1.11 of the LOAN AGREEMENT captioned "Applicable Margin" is
          hereby amended by deleting the percentage "0.75%" appearing under the
          heading "BASE RATE" and inserting in lieu thereof the percentage

          commercial lending rate of the LENDER as publicly announced to be in
          effect from time to time, such rate to be adjusted automatically,
          without notice, on the effective date of any change in such rate. This
          rate of interest is determined from time to time by the LENDER as a
          means of pricing some loans to its customers and is neither tied to
          any external rate of interest or index nor does it necessarily reflect
          the lowest rate of interest actually charged by the LENDER to any
          particular class or category of customers of the LENDER.

     c.   Section 1.31. of the LOAN AGREEMENT captioned "Dollar Cap" is hereby
          amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

          Section 1.31. DollarCap. The term "DOLLAR CAP" means: (a) from March

          2003, Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000.00); and
          (c) from January 1, 2004 through the TERMINATION DATE, Five Million

          EBITDA" and "Minimum Tangible Net Worth Plus Subordinated Debt"
          respectively, are hereby amended and restated in their entirety as

          its entirety as follows:

          Section 7.5. Restricted Payments. None of the BORROWERS shall make any
          RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, except that provided no DEFAULT or EVENT OF
          DEFAULT shall have occurred or shall occur after giving effect to such
          RESTRICTED PAYMENT and provided the total amount of such RESTRICTED

          or payments of principal in accordance with the stated terms of such
          note, when and as any of the same become due (but without giving
          effect to any acceleration or any amendment which would have the
          effect of increasing such payments) under such note; (b) the other

conditions of this MODIFICATION, the LENDER hereby waives the EXISTING DEFAULTS.
The contrary notwithstanding, the waiver granted herein shall not constitute a
waiver of any other violation, DEFAULT, or EVENT OF DEFAULT which may exist

LENDER, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any future violation, DEFAULT, or
EVENT OF DEFAULT occurring under the LOAN AGREEMENT or other LOAN DOCUMENT,
including without limitation, any future or additional violation of Sections
6.21 and/or 6.22 of the LOAN AGREEMENT.
