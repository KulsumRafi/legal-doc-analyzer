accordance with the provisions set forth herein and shall have all powers
necessary or appropriate to enable it to properly administer the Plan, including
but not limited to the power to:

                  (i)      Grant Stock Options and SARs under the Plan,
         including the power to determine the persons to whom options and SARs

                  (iii)    Cancel any Option if an Optionee conducts himself or
         herself in a manner which the Committee, in the exercise of reasonable
         discretion, determines to be inimical to the best interests of the
         Company, including, but not limited to an Optionee's admission of guilt
         or conviction of any crime resulting from dishonesty in connection with
         the affairs of the Company, an Optionee's conducting of the affairs of

         of the Company, or an Optionee's failure to pay an indebtedness to the
         Company which the Committee determines to be uncollectible;

                  (iv)     Construe and interpret the Plan, establish rules and
         regulations, delegate such administrative responsibilities as it deems

         (b)      The Committee's determination under the Plan of the persons to
receive grants, the form, amount and timing of such grants, and the terms and
conditions of such grants need not be uniformly applicable to employees but may

arising out of or in connection with the interpretation and administration of
the Plan shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, that any such
decision made or action taken may be reviewed by the Board, in which event the
determination of the Board shall be final and conclusive. This provision shall
not be construed to grant to an Optionee or an employee any right to a review by

have as members of the Board or of the Committee, the members of the Committee
shall be indemnified by the Company for (a) all costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which
they, or any of them, may be party by reason of any action taken, or failure to
act, under, or in connection with, the Plan or any Stock Option or SAR granted
hereunder, and (b) all amounts paid by them in settlement of any such action,
suit or proceeding (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal
counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them, or any of them, in
satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except a
judgment based upon a finding of bad faith; provided that upon the institution
of any such action, suit or proceeding and prior to taking any steps toward
defense of such action, suit or proceeding, the Committee member shall give the
Company written notice thereof and an opportunity to handle and defend the same
at the Company's own expense.

         Each Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a
written agreement in form approved by the Committee, and shall be subject to the
following provisions and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine:

         6.1      Price. The Option price per share shall be determined by the

expiration of ten years from the date such Stock Option was granted.

         6.3      Time of Exercise. The Committee shall determine the period or
periods during which a Stock Option may be exercised. The Committee may permit
or require a Stock option to be exercisable in installments.

         6.4      Exercise. A Stock Option, or any portion thereof, shall be
exercised by delivery to the Company by the Optionee of a written notice of
exercise, and shall be contingent upon payment by the Optionee, in accordance
with Section 6.5 below, of the full option price for the shares being purchased.
Neither an Optionee nor his executors, administrators, heirs, or legatees shall
have any rights or privileges of a shareholder in respect of the shares
transferable upon exercise of a Stock option, unless and until certificates
representing such shares of Common Stock are issued and delivered to such
Optionee.

         6.5      Payment. The option price of an exercised Stock option, or any
portion thereof, shall be paid either:

                  (a)      in cash, in United States Dollars, or by check, bank
         draft, or money order payable to the order of the Company;

                  (b)      in the sole discretion of the Committee, by the
         delivery of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market
         value equal to the Option price; or

                  (c)      in the sole discretion of the Committee, by any
         combination of (a) and (b) above, or by any other method as the
         Committee in its sole discretion shall approve.

         The Committee shall determine the acceptable methods of payment of the
Option price for each Stock Option and may impose such limitations and
prohibitions on the use of Common Stock to exercise a Stock Option as it deems
appropriate.

<PAGE>

                  6.6      Termination of option. Each Stock Option shall
terminate on the earlier of:

                  to which such Option is subject;

                  (b)      on the date of termination of employment of the
                  Optionee for any reason other than death or retirement,
                  whether such termination of employment is by reason of
                  resignation, dismissal, or otherwise, and whether or not such
                  Stock Option has become exercisable;

                  (c)      one year following the death of an Optionee who dies
                  while in the employ of the Company; and

                  (d)      when termination of employment is due to normal
                  retirement or early retirement (with Committee consent) under
                  a formal plan or policy of the Company, upon the earlier of
                  (i) the expiration date set forth in the option Agreement to
                  which such option is subject, or (ii) the date on which the
                  Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that, within
                  five (5) years following such termination of employment, the
                  retired Optionee directly or indirectly (A) owns Twenty-Five

                  location in which the Company maintains an office, operation,
                  branch, or facility.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, prescribe alternative termination provisions with respect to the
exercise of an option.

For purposes of subsections 6.6(b) and (d), an Optionee shall not be deemed to
have terminated employment or retired during any leave of absence of the
Optionee authorized by the Company under the Company's standard personnel
practices.

         6.7.     Restrictions on Transfer.

                  (a)      Options. Stock Options granted under the Plan shall
         not be transferable by an Optionee except by will or the laws of
         descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during such
         Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. No right or interest of any
         Optionee shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of such
         Optionee.

                  (b)      Common Stock. Any Optionee who disposes of shares of
         Common Stock transferred to the Optionee pursuant to the exercise of an
         ISO within two (2) years after the date of the granting of the Option
         or within one (1) year after the transfer of such

<PAGE>

         shares to the Optionee shall notify the Company of such disposition and
         of the amount realized upon such disposition.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                            STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

         7.1      Terms and Conditions. Simultaneously with the grant of any
Option under the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant to an
Optionee Stock Appreciation rights in connection with any Option granted to such
Optionee. Each SAR shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the
Stock Option to which it is attached, provided that each SAR shall be
exercisable only if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of
exercise exceeds the Option price.

                  Each SAR shall grant to the Optionee the right to surrender,
unexercised, the Stock Option (or any portion thereof which the Optionee
designates) to which the SAR is attached and receive in exchange therefor,
subject to the provisions of the Plan and such rules and regulations as may be
established by the Committee, a payment in an amount equal to the product of,(a)
the amount by which the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock as of the
exercise date exceeds the price per share at which the option may be exercised,
times (b) the number of shares issuable pursuant to the Stock Option, or portion
thereof, which are surrendered. The Committee may, in its sole discretion,
determine whether, upon exercise of an SAR, payment shall be made in the form of
all cash, all shares, or any combination thereof.

                  If the Optionee is to receive a portion of such payment in
shares, the number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount, in
dollars, of such portion to be received in shares by the Fair Market Value of a
share on the exercise date. No fractional shares may be issued.

         7.2      Transferability. SARs granted under the Plan shall not be
transferable by an Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and shall be exercisable, during an Optionee's lifetime, only by
the Optionee. No right or interest of any Optionee shall be subject to any lien,
obligation or liability of such Optionee.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   ADJUSTMENTS

         If there shall be any increase or reduction in the number of shares of
common Stock outstanding by reason of any stock dividends, stock splits, or
other readjustments, or if there is any material change in the capital structure
of the Company by reason of any reclassification,

<PAGE>

reorganization, recapitalization, merger, or consolidation, or otherwise, there
shall be a proportionate and equitable adjustment of the amount and class of
shares available for Options and of the amount and class of shares remaining
subject to any outstanding options and the Option price to be paid therefor, as
determined by the Committee; provided, however, any fractional shares resulting
from any such adjustment shall be eliminated.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                   MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL

         9.1      Merger or Consolidation. If the Company shall merge or
consolidate with another company or reorganize or sell substantially all its
assets, each outstanding Stock Option shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive upon exercise the same securities and property, or either of them, which
a share owner of Common Stock of the same number of shares as that subject to
the Stock option would be entitled to receive pursuant to such merger,
consolidation, reorganization or sale of assets.

         9.2      Change of Control. In the event that:

                  (a)      any person or entity other than the Company shall
         acquire more than 25% of the Common Stock through a tender offer,
         exchange offer or otherwise; or

                  (b)      a change in the "control" of the Company occurs of a
         nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 16(e)
         of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934; or

                  (c)      the Company shall sell substantially all of its
         assets;

any Optionee who is then holding an outstanding Stock Option and who is deemed
by the Committee to be a statutory officer ("insider") for purposes of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall be entitled to surrender any
option, or portion thereof, which is then exercisable, in exchange for a cash
payment in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price of such
Option, or portion thereof, and , (i) in the event of an offer or similar event,
the final offer price per share paid for Common Stock, or such lower price as
the Committee may determine is necessary to preserve the qualified status of an
Incentive Stock Option, times the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
the Option or portion thereof, or (ii) in the event of a change in control, as
defined above, or a sale of substantially all of the Company's assets, the Fair
Market value of the shares subject to the Stock Option.

         Any payment which the Company is required to make pursuant to the above
shall be made within fifteen business days following the event which results in
the Optionee's right to such payment. In the event of a tender offer in which
fewer than all the shares which are validly tendered in compliance with such
offer are purchased or exchanged, then only a fraction of the

<PAGE>

shares to which the Stock Option is subject shall be used in the formula to
determine the amount of such payment. The numerator of such fraction shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the offer and the
denominator of such fraction shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
tendered in compliance with such offer. Any Option, or portion thereof, which is
surrendered in accordance with this Section 9.2, shall be terminated upon
surrender.

         Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.2 the Committee may,
at any time, by unanimous vote, revoke the benefits of this Section 9.2.

                                    ARTICLE X

                        AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN

         10.1     Power to Amend and Terminate Plan. The Board may, at any time,
without further approval of the shareholders, by an instrument in writing,
suspend or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, or amend it in such respects
as the Board, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and in the best
interests of the Company; provided, however, that no amendment shall be made
without approval of the shareholders which would:

                  (a)      materially modify the eligibility requirements set
         forth herein for the granting of Stock Options; or

                  (b)      increase the total number of shares of Common Stock
         which may be issuable under the Plan, except to the extent permitted in
         Article VIII;

         10.2     Restriction on Amendment and Termination. Notwithstanding
tee-provisions of Section 10.1, no amendment, suspension or termination of this
Plan may reduce or impair any of the rights or obligations under any then
outstanding Stock Option granted to- an Optionee under the Plan, without the
Optionee's consent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                        GOVERNMENT AND OTHER REGULATIONS

         The granting of Stock Options and the obligation of the Company to
issue or transfer and deliver shares for Stock Options exercised under the Plan
shall be subject to all applicable laws, regulations, rules, orders and
approvals which shall be in effect at the time such grant is to be made or
obligation arises and which are required by governmental entities or by the
stock exchanges, if any, on which the Common Stock is traded.

<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE XII

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         12.1     Right to Continued Employment. No person shall have any claim
or right to be granted a Stock option or SAR under the Plan, and the grant of a
Stock option or SAR under the Plan shall not be construed as giving an Optionee
the right to be retained in the employ of the Company. Further, the Company
expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss an Optionee with or without
cause, such dismissal to be free from any liability or any claim under the Plan,
except as provided herein or in an option agreement.

         12.2     Other Benefit Plans. No awards, payments or benefits under the
Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any
retirement, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan to which the Company
contributes.

         12.3     Plan Expenses. Expenses of administering this Plan shall be
borne by the Company.

         12.4     Use of Exercise Proceeds. Payments received from Optionees in
connection with the-exercise of Stock options under the Plan shall be used for
the general corporate purposes of the Company.

         12.5     Construction of Plan. The Plan shall be administered in the
State of Alabama, shall be governed and interpreted solely in accordance with
the laws of the State of Alabama and shall be binding on and inure to the
benefit of any successor or successors of the Company.

         12.6     Exemption From Registration of Shares. In the event the shares
issuable pursuant to any Option are not registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and if the Company so requests prior to the delivery of such shares, in
connection with the availability of an exemption from Registration of such
shares under Federal or State securities laws or otherwise, then the Optionee or
other person exercising such Option, shall agree to hold any shares issued under
the said option solely for investment and without any present intention to
resell or distribute the same, and to dispose of such shares only in compliance
with applicable securities laws and regulations, and shall execute and deliver
to the Company an agreement to this effect.

         12.7     Withholding Taxes. Each participant shall, no later than the
date as of which the gross income of the participant is recognized for Federal
income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to
the Committee for payment of, any Federal, state, or local income taxes of any
kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the exercise of a non-ISO or
SAR. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such
payment or arrangements and the Company (and, where applicable, its
Subsidiaries), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct
any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise

<PAGE>

due to the participant. A participant may elect to have the minimum withholding
tax obligations with respect to any non-ISO or SAR granted hereunder satisfied
by having the Company withhold shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to the
participant with respect to such non-ISO. Additionally, if the Committee so
determines, the participant may elect to deliver to the Company unrestricted
shares which have been held by the participant for at least six (6) months to
satisfy any additional tax obligations owed by the participant.

         12.8     Headings. The headings and subheadings in this Plan have been
inserted for convenience and reference only and are not to be used in construing
the instrument or any provisions hereof.

         12.9     Number and Gender. The masculine pronoun used shall include
the feminine pronoun and the singular number shall include the plural number
unless the context of the Plan requires otherwise.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                    SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AND EFFECTIVE DATES

         Upon approval by the shareholders of the Company, this Plan shall
become effective as of January 20, 1988. The Plan and all outstanding Stock
options and SARs shall remain in effect until such Stock Options and SARs have
expired or have been cancelled. If the shareholders shall not approve the Plan,
it shall not be effective, and any and all actions taken hereunder shall be null
and void or, if necessary, shall be deemed to have been fully rescinded.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused its duly authorized officers
to affix their signatures and the seal of the corporation to this Plan on this
the 20th day of January, 1988.
