<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A. <U>Establishment of Annual Compensation</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Effective January 1, 2003, an annual compensation amount (the
&quot;Annual Base Compensation&quot;) payable to Non-Employee Directors
(hereafter &quot;Directors&quot;) of General Electric Company (the
&quot;Company&quot;) shall be established from time-to-time by the Board of
Directors. Directors who are members of the Audit Committee or the Management
Development and Compensation Committee shall also receive additional annual
compensation equal to ten percent (10%) of the Annual Base Compensation for
service on each such committee (such additional compensation together with the
Annual Base Compensation are collectively referred to as the &quot;Annual
Compensation&quot;). The amount of Annual Compensation will be reported annually
in the Proxy Statement.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">B. <U>Payment of Annual Compensation</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">1. The Annual Compensation shall be payable in quarterly
installments, with each installment payable as promptly as practicable following
the last business day of the calendar quarter to which it applies. Quarterly
payments shall be pro rated if Board service commences or terminates during a
calendar quarter.<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">2. The Annual Compensation shall be paid sixty percent (60%) in
Deferred Stock Units (&quot;DSUs&quot;) and forty percent (40%) in cash. The
number of DSUs to be paid and the terms of the DSUs shall be determined as
provided in the following sections of this Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">3. Prior to their annual election to the Board, each Director
may also elect to receive in DSUs all or part of that portion of his or her
Annual Compensation otherwise payable in cash. Such an election shall be
irrevocable for the period for which the director is elected.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">4. All DSUs paid with respect to Annual Compensation will be
credited to the Director's DSU account (the &quot;DSU Account&quot;) when such
Annual Compensation is payable (the &quot;Payment Date&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">5. The Director's DSU Account will be credited with the number
of DSUs calculated to the nearest thousandths of a DSU, determined by dividing
the dollar amount of compensation payable in DSUs on the Payment Date by the
average of the closing market price of the Company's common stock as reported on
the Consolidated Tape of the New York Stock Exchange listed shares for the 20
trading days immediately preceding such Payment Date.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A. <U>Consolidation of Prior Deferred Fee Accounts</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For Directors serving on the Board on January 1, 2003, the
balances of deferred stock units in any deferred fee accounts maintained by the
Company under the Company's Non-Employee Director Deferred Fee Plan in effect on
December 31, 2002, or predecessors to that plan, shall be deemed to be
transferred to the DSU Accounts established under this Plan, and, together with
any other amounts specifically credited to a Director's DSU Account, shall be
administered under the terms of this Plan. The balances of deferred stock units
in any deferred fee accounts maintained by the Company under the Company's
Non-Employee Director Deferred Fee Plan in effect on December 31, 2002, or
predecessors to that plan, for former directors who were not serving on the
Board on January 1, 2003 shall be administered under the applicable terms of
such prior plan or plans.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">B. <U>Crediting With Dividend Equivalents</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">1. On each dividend payment date, a Director's DSU Account will
be credited with regular quarterly dividend equivalents in additional DSUs
determined by multiplying the number of DSUs in the Director's DSU Account on
the related dividend record date by any per share cash dividends declared by the
Company on its common stock and dividing the product by the closing market price
of the Company's common stock as reported on the Consolidated Tape of the New
York Stock Exchange listed shares on such dividend payment date.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">2. The DSU Accounts will also be credited with DSUs by
multiplying the number of DSUs in the Director's DSU Account by any stock
dividends declared by the Company on its common stock.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Recapitalization</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If, as a result of a recapitalization of the Company (including
stock splits), the Company's outstanding shares of common stock shall be changed
into a greater or smaller number of shares, the number of DSUs credited to a
Director's DSU Account shall be appropriately adjusted on the same basis.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">D. <U>Election To Switch DSUs Upon Termination of Board Service</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</U>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Prior to the end of the calendar year in which Board service
terminates, a Director may irrevocably elect to switch up to 100% of the value
of the DSUs in his or her DSU Account into cash, effective on the date one year
following termination of Board service (hereafter &quot;First Anniversary
Date&quot;). The cash value of the DSUs will be based on the number of DSUs in
the Director's DSU Account on the First Anniversary Date multiplied by the
average of the closing market price of the Company's common stock as reported on
the Consolidated Tape for the New York Stock Exchange listed shares for the 20
trading days immediately preceding the First Anniversary Date. The cash in the
DSU Account will thereafter be credited monthly with interest equivalents based
upon the prior calendar month's average yield for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds
with maturities of from ten to twenty years, as published by an official agency
to be determined by the Senior Vice President - Finance and utilized on a
consistent year to year basis.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  </U>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">(a) At any time before the end of the calendar year in which
  Board service terminates, a Director may elect to have the DSU Account paid:
  (i) in a lump sum on the First Anniversary Date (or as soon thereafter as
  practicable); or (ii) in up to ten (10) annual installments, beginning in the
  month of July following the First Anniversary Date.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">(b) In the event that a Director's service on the Board
  terminates as a result of death or disability, the Director or, in the case of
  death, the beneficiary(s) designated by the Director (or failing such
  designation, the Director's estate), may elect to have the value of the
  Director's DSU Account on the date of the Director's death or disability: (i)
  paid out in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Director's death
  or disability; or (ii) paid out in annual installments up to an aggregate of
  ten (10) annual installments, commencing in the month of July following the
  Director's death or disability. In the event of a Director's death subsequent
  to termination of Board service, but prior to receiving all entitled deferred
  payments, the beneficiary(s) designated by the Director (or failing such

  Director's DSU Account on the date of the Director's death paid out in a lump
  sum as soon as practicable following the Director's death.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">(a) All payouts of a Director's DSU Account will be paid
        in cash.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">(b) The amount of the first cash installment payment
        shall be a fraction of the cash or fraction of the value of the DSUs in
        the Director's DSU Account on the date of the initial installment
        payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is
        the total number of installments elected. Each subsequent installment
        shall be calculated in the same manner as of the date of that
        installment payment, except that the denominator shall be reduced by the
        number of installments which have been previously paid.</P>
        <P ALIGN="LEFT">(c) The value of DSUs in a Director's DSU Account will
        be determined for purposes of the preceding section by multiplying the
        number of DSUs in the Director's DSU Account on the payment date by the
        average of the closing market price of the Company's common stock as
        reported on the Consolidated Tape of New York Stock Exchange listed
        shares for the 20 trading days immediately preceding such date.</P>
