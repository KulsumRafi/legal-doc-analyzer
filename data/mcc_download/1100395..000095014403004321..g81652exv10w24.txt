number of RESTAURANTS, the product of such multiplication being divided by sixty
(60).

Where:

X = amount to be contributed or reimbursed
Y = number of months to elapse until the expiration of the PERFORMANCE PERIOD
Z = greater or lesser number of RESTAURANTS

6.2.- In addition to the contributions set forth under Subsection 6.1 above, AOL
shall annually share the operating expenses of the PROJECT. The amount to be
contributed by AOL will be considered according to (i) the number of RESTAURANTS
actually equipped, and (ii) the number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS (as per the
definition below), and wil be in an annual amount that is the lesser of either
"I" or "N", according to the following formula:

"I"

I = R$5,333.33 X IR- (R$10.666,66 x NI)

In words: "I" is equal to Five Thousand, Three Hundred Thirty-Three Reals and
Thirty-Three Centavos (R$5,333.33) multiplied by the number of restaurants
actually equipped, as defined below, minus the product of the multiplication of
Ten Thousand, Six Hundred and Sixty Six Reals and Sixty Six Cents [R$10.666,66]
for the number of non-equipped RESTAURANTS

IR: (i) with respect to the first year of the PERFORMANCE PERIOD, the number of
RESTAURANTS actually equipped as of the end of such period, and (ii) the average
number of RESTAURANTS actually equipped in the course of each year. Such average
number of RESTAURANTS will result from the division of the total number of
RESTAURANTS equipped as of the last day of each month of the relevant year by
twelve (12).

"NI": (i) with respect to the first year of the PERFORMANCE PERIOD, the number
of non-equipped RESTAURANTS, that it, the difference between 550 and "RI", as of

                                       10
<PAGE>

the end of such period, and (ii) for the remaining year, the average number of
non-equipped RESTAURANTS in the course of each year, that is 600 minus "RI" for
each such period. In the event of "I" being negative, then MCDONALD'S will
reimburse AOL such amount by the 20th business day immediately subsequent.

"N"

N = R$3,200,000.00 X ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS
                     ------------------
                     ACQUISITION TARGET

In words: "N" is equal to Three Million an Two Hundred Thousand Reals
(R$3,200,000.00) multiplied by the quotient of the number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS
divided by the ACQUISITION TARGET.

Where:


"N": Amount to be annually disbursed by AOL, limited to the minimum and maximum
amounts set forth in the table below;

"ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS": number of AOL accounts acquired during each year of the
PERFORMANCE PERIOD, as determined with basis on the PROMOCODES, the holders of
which make payment of the first two (2) successive monthly fees;

"ACQUISITION TARGET": number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS, according to the following
table:

6.2.1.- The amount of the contributions set forth in Subsection 6.2 above, will
depend upon compliance with the terms of the SCHEDULE, to the extent that such
amount is tied to the number of RESTAURANTS actually equipped in the course of
the first year. Failure to comply with the SCHEDULE will entail the application

agrees that the monthly targets for installation in RESTAURANTS, as set forth in

the amounts set forth in Subsection 6.2 above will be contributed to MCDONALD'S,
or anyone whom MCDONALD'S shall designate, such as service providers and/or
suppliers. It is hereby agreed between the parties that (i) AOL accepts no
liability to any such service providers and/or suppliers, and (ii) said
procedure shall be oriented toward a solution imposing a less onerous tax/fiscal
burden on the parties.

6.3.- To the extent that one of the principal reasons for the execution of this
instrument is the soliciting by AOL of new subscribers, as provided under
Subsection 2.5 hereinabove, it is hereby expressly agreed between the parties
that, once the performance targets are achieved within a given period, as set
forth in the table contained in Subsection 6.2 above, regardless of the number
of RESTAURANTS and/or TERMINALS installed, no reimbursement will be applicable.

6.3.1.- The parties expressly agree hereby that, in the event the number of
annually ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS exceeds the ACQUISITION TARGETS, as such have been
set forth in Subsection 6.2 above, such exceeding ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS may be used,
at MCDONALD'S sole discretion, to assist in achieving the targets for subsequent
years. In such event, that portion of the "N" amount relating to the number of
ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS that exceeds the ACQUISITION TARGET, which is carried forward
to the following year, will not become due.

6.4.- All amounts denominated in Reals in this Section VI will be annually
adjusted in accordance with the IGP-M/FGV, as of the date of execution hereof.
In addition, any reimbursable amount owing from MCDONALD'S, which is not
reimbursed on the agreed dates, will be subject to a two percent (2%) penalty on
the unpaid amount plus interest at a rate of one percent (1%) per month, and
will be adjusted for inflation in accordance with the IGP-M/FGV, regardless of
notice or notification.

reviewed and AOL will not be subject to any additional contribution, where
TERMINALS are installed in more than six hundred (600) RESTAURANTS, or more than
three thousand and six hundred (3,600) TERMINALS are installed during the
PERFORMANCE PERIOD. In such event, all of the terms and conditions of this
agreement will be applicable, including, without limitation, its provisions
relating to exclusivity.

6.6.- Out of the amounts received from each new AOL subscriber solicited through
the PROJECT, AOL will pay:

(a) [**] of an amount equal to [**] to the Ronald McDonald Institute, after
having received payment of the first monthly fee subsequent to any grace period
that may have been granted;

(b) [**] of an amount equal to [**] to MCDONALD'S, pursuant to an incentive

<PAGE>

RESTAURANT engaged in the PROJECT, after having received payment for the 2nd

connection with the PROJECT, to be mutually defined by the parties, after having
received payment for the 2nd monthly fee.

of the parties, at any time, infringe or fail to perform any of its obligations
hereunder and/or under any appropriate amendment hereto, and not cure such
infringement or failure with thirty (30) days after notice being given by the

1.       HARDWARE:

The TERMINALS shall be equipped with at least one of the following operating
systems: Window 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 or Windows XP; 0.8 Ghz Pentium or
Celeron Processors, or compatible; RAM memory of 128 Mb; Hard Disk of 10Gb with

2.       CONNECTIONS:

     a.  The TERMINALS shall be equipped with broad-band access facility with a
         dedicated line and a minimum bandwidth of 64 Kbps for transport between
         the store and the IP access provider per RESTAURANT.

     b.  The IP access provider shall be directly connected to or shall have not
         more than one intermediary backbone (transit) to connect with one of
         the principal backbones of Brazil (Embratel, Telemar, Brasil Telecom,
         Telefonica, Fapesp).

     c.  The TCP/UDP ports required for the operation of the AOL Software shall
         be available, including the ports required for registration of new
         users.

     d.  The IP address ranges to be used shall be informed to AOL in not less
         than 10 days from the commencement of use thereof, in order that AOL
         may enable them to accept the registration of new accounts.

     e.  The parties may discuss, as of the beginning of the second year of the
         PERFORMANCE PERIOD, the possibility of any upgrades in the connections
         set forth herein, provided that it is economically feasible.


3.       SERVICE LEVEL

With a view to maintaining good navigation conditions, MCDONALD'S will use its
best efforts in order that the following metrics may be observed:

     a.           The loss of IP packets between each of the PCs installed in
                  the stores and the AOL data center in Sao Paulo shall be less
                  than 2%, measured as a daily average.

                                       21

     b.           Average latency, or time interval required for data to be
                  transported between each of the PCs installed in the stores
                  and the AOL data center in Sao Paulo, shall be less than 50ms.

     c.           The monthly mean unavailability of service shall be less than
                  or equal to 10 minutes.

     d.           The IP access provider shall keep a support center operating
                  on a 24hours x 7days basis to register calls in the event of
                  failure in such connection.

     e.           The maximum time for the solution of IP access problems shall
                  not exceed 2 hours, as of the registration of a trouble
                  ticket.

     f.           After resolution of the problem, the IP access provider, or an
                  employee of MCDONALD'S shall contact the NOC (Network
                  Operation Center) of AOL Brasil (+ 55-11-4993-5998) to close
                  the trouble ticket.

                                    ANNEX IV

              PROMOCODES AND PROCEDURE TO VERIFY ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS


A) Procedure to verify ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS and contributions for annual
maintenance (Subsection 6.2 of the agreement)


1. On the second business day after each ANNIVERSARY DATE, AOL will submit to
MCDONALD'S a report on the number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS during the previous year
and the amount to be contributed by AOL to MCDONALD'S under Subsection 6.2 of
the Agreement.


2. Such contribution will be made in accordance with terms to be agreed upon,
subject to the provisions under Paragraph 6.2.4 of the agreement.


3. On a date that is two (2) business days after one hundred and twenty (120)
days following each ANNIVERSARY DATE, AOL will submit to MCDONALD'S a further
report on the new number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS during the previous year,
including subscribers who have registered in the previous year, but who have
only paid their 2nd successive monthly fee between that ANNIVERSARY DATE and the
expiration of the period of one hundred and twenty (120) days referred to above.
The parties agree that subscribers who make payment after such period of one
hundred and twenty (120) days will no longer be computed for the effects of
Subsection 6.2. Together with such report, AOL will submit the amount to be
contributed by AOL to MCDONALD'S on account of the difference, if any, with
basis on the new number of ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS computed, all in accordance with
terms to be agreed upon, subject to the provisions under Paragraph 6.2.4.


B) Procedure for the payments to be made under Subsection 6.6 of the Agreement

1. On the second business day of each month, AOL will submit to MCDONALD'S a
report on the amounts payable by AOL to MCDONALD'S with respect to the previous
month (reference month), as provided under Subsection 6.6 of the Agreement.


2. The amounts payable as referred to above will be made on a monthly basis up
to the twentieth (20th) business day of the immediately following month,
according to a procedure to be agreed upon between the parties concurrently with
the procedures to be established as provided under Paragraphs 6.1.2 and 6.2.4.

3. The payments set forth herein will continue to be made for a period of only
four (4) months after the expiration of the EFFECTIVE PERIOD, in order that all
ACQUIRED ACCOUNTS may be computed with respect to the period until the
expiration of the EFFECTIVE PERIOD. Nevertheless, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated for breach of any of the provisions hereunder by
MCDONALD'S, AOL will not be required to make the payments referred to above as
of such termination.
