valuable consideration, the parties hereto adopt the above recitals and agree as
follows:

         1. Capitalized terms not defined herein but defined in the Loan
Agreement shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan
Agreement.

the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                  1.29     "Expiration Date" means the earlier to occur of (a)
                           the date upon which the Lender shall declare an Event
                           of Default under the Obligations and accelerate the
                           same in accordance with this Agreement; or (b)
