            Lenders,  and the amount of each such  Borrowing  shall be  prorated
            among such Lenders  based on the  percentages  set forth above.  All
            Advances by each Lender  shall be  evidenced  by a single  Revolving
            Note payable to such Lender  substantially  in the form of EXHIBIT A

            Borrowing,  and unless  expressly  agreed by the Required Lenders in
            writing to the contrary in accordance with SECTION 10.02,  shall not
            be deemed a waiver or modification of any condition to the making of
            any future Borrowing."
