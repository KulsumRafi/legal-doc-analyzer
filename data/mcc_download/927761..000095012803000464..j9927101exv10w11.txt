                  language; and (ii) the English version of this Second Amended
                  Credit Agreement shall govern for all purposes.

         9.       SEVERABILITY. If one or more provisions of this Second Amended
                  Credit Agreement be or become invalid, or unenforceable in

                  shall not be affected. The parties hereto undertake to replace
                  any such invalid provision without delay with a valid
                  provision which as nearly as possible duplicates the corporate
                  intent of the invalid provision.
