                                                                  EXECUTION COPY


                            TAX COOPERATION AGREEMENT


         Agreement (the "Agreement") by and between The Williams Companies.
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Williams"), and Williams Communications Group,
Inc. a Delaware corporation ("Communications") entered into as of the 30th day
of September, 1999, amended and restated as of the 23rd day of April 2001, and
as entered into on the 26th day of July, 2002, to be effective and amended,
restated and renamed as of the date on which the first amended Joint Chapter 11
Plan of Reorganization with respect to Communications and CG Austria, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, dated as of the 26th day of July, 2002, is consummated and
becomes effective and binding in all material respects (the "Effective Date").

                                    RECITALS

         Williams and Communications entered into a tax sharing agreement dated
September 30, 1999 (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") to allocate and settle among
themselves the consolidated Federal income tax liabilities of the TWC Group (as
hereinafter defined), the unitary, combined, consolidated or similar state
income tax liabilities of the parties and, if and as determined by Williams,
certain other tax liabilities.

         On April 23, 2001, Williams distributed most of the stock of
Communications owned by Williams to Williams' public shareholders (the
"Spin-off"). Also on April 23, 2001, Williams and Communications amended and
restated the Tax Sharing Agreement.

         Williams and Communications wish to amend, restate and rename the Tax
Sharing Agreement and execute this Agreement which will, as of the Effective
Date, supersede the Tax Sharing Agreement and be the sole governing agreement
between Williams and Communications to allocate and settle among themselves the
consolidated Federal income tax liabilities of the TWC Group, the unitary,
combined, consolidated or similar state income tax liabilities of the parties
and certain other tax liabilities arising prior to or after the Spin-off and to
provide procedures with respect to such tax matters.

                                   AGREEMENTS

         Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                               CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

         The defined terms used in this Agreement shall, except as otherwise
expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings
specified in this Article I. The singular shall include the plural and masculine
gender shall include the feminine, the neuter and vice versa, as the context
requires.



                                      -1-
<PAGE>

         "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

          "Final Determination" means an IRS Form 870 or 870AD that reflects an
adjustment to any item (or a component of an item) shown on a Tax return
(whether or not such adjustment results in a deficiency in Taxes) and any
similar state, local or foreign form, a closing agreement or an accepted offer
in compromise with the IRS (or appropriate state, local or foreign taxing
authority) or any other adjustment to any item to which the taxpayer concedes
(including, but not limited to, the filing of an amended return upon which the
taxpayer adjusts an item in the favor of the IRS (or the appropriate state,
local or foreign taxing authority)) or as to which the period of limitations has
expired (whether or not such adjustment results in a deficiency in Taxes), a
claim for refund that has been allowed, a deficiency notice with respect to
which the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court has expired, or a
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or
the time for appeal of which has expired.

         "IPO Date" means October 1, 1999 (the date of the initial public
offering of stock of Communications).

         "IRS" means the Internal Revenue Service.

         "Post-IPO Date / Pre-Spin-off WCG Attribute" means any operating loss
or loss or credit carryover or similar attribute of WCG attributable to dates
beginning on the IPO Date and ending on the Spin-off Date (including the portion
of the taxable year beginning on January 1, 2001 and ending on the Spin-off
Date). If an amended return is filed or there is any change by Final
Determination to an operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar
attribute of WCG (or items giving rise to such operating loss or loss or credit
carryover or similar attribute of WCG), Williams shall allocate such changes in
the operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar attribute of WCG
(and/or reallocate any previously allocated operating loss or loss or credit
carryover or similar attribute of WCG that is affected by a change in items
giving rise to such operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar
attribute of WCG) between Williams and WCG pursuant to the following method: (i)
if the item (that caused the adjustment) has been previously allocated between
Williams and WCG on a Federal income tax return or on Exhibit A, the change to
such item shall be allocated in the same manner such item was allocated on the
most recently filed Federal income tax return, or if such item has not been
allocated on such return, in the same manner such item was allocated on Exhibit
A; (ii) if (i) does not apply, to the extent that such item clearly relates to
the income, assets or operations of Williams (or non-WCG members of the TWC
Group), the change to such item shall be allocated to Williams and to the extent
that the item clearly relates to the income, assets or operations of WCG, the
change to such item shall be allocated to WCG; (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii)
apply, then the change to such item shall be allocated pro-rata according to the
most relevant measure for such item, unless Williams and WCG otherwise agree
that another allocation method would be more equitable. If such item is an
adjustment with respect to the 1999 taxable year, such item shall first be
allocated to periods before and after the IPO Date as provided below in the
definition of Pre-IPO Date WCG Attribute.

         "Pre-IPO Date WCG Attribute" means any operating loss or loss or credit
carryover or similar attribute, of WCG attributable to dates preceding the IPO
Date (including the portion of the 1999 taxable year beginning on January 1,
1999 and ending on the day preceding the IPO Date). Any operating loss or loss
or credit carryover or similar attribute of WCG attributable to a



                                      -2-
<PAGE>

taxable year ending in or before 1998 shall be a Pre-IPO Date WCG Attribute
notwithstanding any changes to such items resulting from an amended return or a
Final Determination. The PreIPO Date WCG Attributes (and items giving rise to
such attributes) attributable to the taxable year 1999 initially shall be based
on the total amount of operating loss or loss or credit carryovers or similar
attribute of WCG set forth in the latest (regular or amended) TWC Group
consolidated 1999 Federal income tax return that is filed prior to the Spin-off
Date or, if not so set forth, then as set forth on Exhibit B. If an amended
return is filed or there is any change by Final Determination to an operating
loss or loss or credit carryover or similar attribute of WCG (or items giving
rise to such operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar attribute of
WCG) for the taxable year 1999, Williams shall first allocate such changes in
the operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar attribute of WCG
(and/or reallocate any previously allocated operating loss or loss or credit
carryover or similar attribute of WCG that is affected by a change in items
giving rise to such operating loss or loss or credit carryover or similar
attribute of WCG) to periods before and after the IPO Date, and (if such
attribute is allocated to a date after the IPO Date) between Williams and WCG
pursuant to the following method: (i) if the item (that caused the adjustment)
has been previously allocated between Williams and WCG on the TWC Group
consolidated 1999 Federal income tax return or on Exhibit B, the change to such
item shall be allocated in the same manner such item was allocated on the latest
(regular or amended) TWC Group consolidated 1999 Federal income tax return, or
if such item has not been allocated on such return, in the same manner such item
was allocated on Exhibit B; (ii) if (i) does not apply, (a) for allocations of
items to periods before and after the IPO Date, to the extent that such item
clearly relates to periods prior to the IPO Date, the change to such item shall
be allocated to the period prior to the IPO Date, and to the extent that such
item clearly relates to periods after the IPO Date, the change to such item
shall be allocated to the period after the IPO Date and (b) for allocations of
items between Williams and WCG, to the extent that the item clearly relates the
income, assets or operations of Williams, the change to such item shall be
allocated to Williams, and to the extent that the item clearly relates the
income, assets or operations of WCG, the change to such item shall be allocated
to WCG; (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) apply, then such item shall be allocated
pro-rata according to the most relevant measure for such item, unless Williams
and WCG otherwise agree that another allocation method would be more equitable.

         "Spin-off Date" means April 23, 2001.

         "Taxes" means all taxes, assessments, charges, duties, fees, levies or
other governmental charges, including, without limitation, all Federal, state,

stock, transfer, sales, use, occupation, property, excise, severance, windfall
profits, stamp, license, payroll, withholding and other taxes, assessments,
charges, duties, fees, levies or other governmental charges of any kind
whatsoever (whether payable directly or by withholding and whether or not
requiring the filing of a return), all estimated taxes, deficiency assessments,
additions to tax, penalties and interest and shall include any liability for
such amounts as a result either of being a member of a combined, consolidated,
unitary or affiliated group or of a contractual obligation to indemnify any
person or other entity.

         "TWC Group" means Williams and other corporations (whether existing or
hereafter formed or acquired) that at the time would be entitled or required to
join with Williams in filing a consolidated Federal income tax return.

         "WCG" means the group of corporations consisting of Communications and
all members of the TWC Group owned, directly or indirectly and in whole or in
part, by Communications (but shall not include Williams or any other corporation
in the TWC Group in which a member of the WCG does not directly own a 5%
interest).

         "WCG Loss Carryover" means any TWC Group consolidated loss (or other
similar attribute) attributable to Communications or such other member of WCG,
if any (as determined by Williams and Communications in accordance with any

Treasury Regulations thereunder) that became an attribute of Communications or
such other member of WCG after the Spin-off.

         "WCG Credit Carryover" means any TWC Group consolidated credit
carryover (or other similar attribute) attributable to Communications or such

Communications or such other member of WCG after the Spin-off.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                    PAYMENTS

         Section 2.01 Tax Liability.

         Williams and Communications have settled all payments with respect to
Taxes for all periods and no payments shall be required to be made by Williams
to Communications or by Communications to Williams with respect to Taxes for any
period; provided, however, that Williams hereby indemnifies Communications and
each corporation that is a member of WCG from and against any Taxes for which
Communications or any such WCG member has liability under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law
relating to the membership of Communications or any such WCG member in the TWC
Group.

                                   ARTICLE III

         Section 3.01 Williams as Agent.

(a) General rule. Communications hereby irrevocably appoints Williams as its
agent, and Communications hereby agrees that Williams shall have sole and
absolute authority, for the purposes of preparing and filing consolidated
Federal income tax returns for the TWC Group (including, without limitation,
preparing and filing estimated tax returns, amended tax returns and claims for
refund, determining tax return positions, selecting methods of accounting and
making elections). Communications agrees that Williams (acting reasonably and
with an obligation to consider suggestions by Communications) shall: (i) (A)
represent any member of WCG that is a member of the TWC Group with respect to
any consolidated Federal income tax



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

audit or consolidated Federal income tax controversy (including, without
limitation, any proceeding with the IRS and any judicial proceedings, whether
any such proceedings relate to a claim for additional taxes or a claim for
refund of taxes), (B) settle or compromise any claim for additional, or any
claim for refund of, Federal income taxes of any member of WCG that is a member
of the TWC Group, and (C) direct all communications between the IRS and any
employee of a member of WCG that is a member of the TWC Group with respect to
any issue that could affect an item reflected on the consolidated Federal income
tax return of the TWC Group; (ii) engage outside counsel, accountants and other
experts with respect to Federal income tax matters relating to any member of WCG
that is a member of the TWC Group; and (iii) take any other action in connection
with Federal income tax matters relating to any member of WCG that is a member
of the TWC Group (or relating to any other member of the TWC Group) as Williams
determines to be necessary or appropriate. Communications agrees that no
employee of WCG or any of its member companies will provide any information
(whether written or oral) to the IRS that could affect an item reflected on the
consolidated Federal income tax return of the TWC Group, except at the direction
of Williams.

         (b) Exceptions for certain matters affecting Communications.
Notwithstanding (a), the following exceptions shall apply to the general rule
set forth in (a) if there is an audit or any proposed adjustment that could
reduce either: (i) a WCG Loss Carryover or (ii) a WCG Credit Carryover (a
"Communications Tax Matter"):

         (i) Williams shall promptly give Communications notice of the
commencement of a Communications Tax Matter, and Williams shall inform
Communications of the status of, and any material discussion or provision of
material information by Williams with respect to, a Communications Tax Matter.
In addition, Communications shall have the right to provide documentation to an
IRS agent and present an argument to an IRS agent supporting a position that is
consistent with the positions taken by Williams with respect to such audit;
provided, however, that Williams shall have full rights to control the audit and
all presentations to an IRS agent and to be present during any presentation by
Communications to the IRS.

         (ii) Williams shall inform Communications of any formal conference with
Appeals regarding a Communications Tax Matter. To the extent feasible, Williams
shall provide copies to Communications of any written submissions to Appeals
that contain discussions of a Communications Tax Matter a reasonable period
prior to the submission of such written materials, and, to the extent feasible,
Williams agrees to consult with Communications in good faith regarding the legal
arguments raised in such submissions. Communications does not have the right to
be present or represented at appeals conferences, but Williams, at
Communications' request, will discuss with Communications what transpired at an
appeals conference regarding a Communications Tax Matter.

         (iii) Williams shall not enter into a settlement regarding a
Communications Tax Matter without the consent of Communications, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         (iv) If (a) Communications furnishes to Williams an opinion of
nationally recognized tax counsel that it is more likely than not that the IRS's
position regarding a Communications Tax



                                      -5-
<PAGE>

Matter will not be sustained by a court, and (b) Communications shall have
acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify Williams in the event the
litigation is unsuccessful, Communications can compel Williams to litigate a
position, using counsel acceptable to both Communications and Williams, at
Communications' expense. With respect to any Communications Tax Matter that
cannot be litigated or separated from any other matter, Williams shall have the
right to use its own counsel and such counsel shall control the litigation
(including making legal and strategic decisions and making arguments in court),
but Williams shall consider in good faith suggestions and concerns raised by
Communications' counsel regarding the Communications Tax Matter, and, if
reasonably feasible, Williams shall permit Communications' counsel to control
the legal arguments with respect to the Communications Tax Matter.

         Section 3.02 Cooperation. Communications shall cooperate with Williams,
and Williams shall cooperate with Communications, regarding the application of
all aspects of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the proper and
timely preparation and filing of any tax return to which this Agreement applies,
the calculation of basis and the conduct of any tax audit or tax controversy to
which this Agreement applies) (i) by maintaining such books, records, accounting
data and other information in its possession necessary for the preparation and
filing of all consolidated Federal income tax returns of the TWC Group for 10
years and by not disposing of any such books, records, accounting data and other
information after such 10-year period without first providing Williams or
Communications, as the case may be, with a 90-day opportunity to obtain such
books, records, accounting data and other information; (ii) by providing such
other information as requested by Williams or Communications, as the case may
be, (iii) by executing such documents and (iv) by taking any such other action
(including, without limitation, making any officers, directors, employees and
agents available to Williams or Communications, as the case may be), in each
such case as Williams or Communications, as the case may be, may request from
time to time. Communications or Williams, as the case may be, shall secure the
covenant of any acquirer of any member of WCG or Williams, as the case may be,
to comply with this Section 3.02 for the benefit of Williams and Williams's
successors and assigns or for the benefit of Communications or Communications's
successor and assigns, as the case may be. For purposes of this section 3.02, in
addition to Communications's obligations pursuant to this section,
Communications shall cause WCG to comply with each obligation pursuant to this
section, and in addition to Williams's obligations pursuant to this section,
Williams shall cause all non-WCG members of the TWC Group to comply with each
obligation pursuant to this section.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER FEDERAL TAXES

         4.01 Williams and Communications have settled all payments with respect
to state, local, foreign and other federal Taxes for all periods and no payments
shall be required to be made by Williams to Communications or by Communications
to Williams with respect to such Taxes for any period.
