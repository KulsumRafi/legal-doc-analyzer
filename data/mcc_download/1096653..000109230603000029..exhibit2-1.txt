         2.  REPRESENTATIONS   AND  WARRANTIES  OF  THE  SELLING   STOCKHOLDER.
The Selling  Stockholder hereby  represents,  warrants and covenants to and with
Magnolia as follows:

                  2.1 POWER  AND  AUTHORITY.  The  Selling  Stockholder  has all
requisite  individual  power and authority to enter into and to carry out all of
the terms of this  Agreement and all other  documents  executed and delivered in
connection herewith  (collectively,  the "Documents").  All individual action on
the part of the Selling Stockholder necessary for the authorization,  execution,
delivery and  performance of the Documents by the Selling  Stockholder  has been
taken and no further  authorization  on the part of the Selling  Stockholder  is
required to consummate  the  transactions  provided for in the  Documents.  When
executed  and  delivered  by  the  Selling  Stockholder,   the  Documents  shall
constitute the valid and legally binding  obligation of the Selling  Stockholder
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.

                  2.2  OWNERSHIP  OF  AND  TITLE  TO  SECURITIES.   The  Selling
Stockholder  represents  that he is the  sole  owner  of all of the  issued  and
outstanding  shares of AP Henderson Common Stock and that there are no warrants,
options,  subscriptions,  calls,  or other  similar  rights  of any kind for the
issuance or  purchase  of any  securities  of AP  Henderson  held by the Selling
Stockholder or any other persons.  The Selling  Stockholder  represents that the
Selling  Stockholder has and will transfer to Magnolia good and marketable title
to the AP Henderson Shares,  free and clear of all pledges,  security interests,
mortgages, liens, claims, charges, restrictions or encumbrances.

                  2.3 NO  GOVERNMENTAL  OR OTHER  PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION.  The
Selling  Stockholder  represents  that, to his best  knowledge,  no order of any
court or  administrative  agency is in effect which  restrains or prohibits  the
Selling Stockholder from consummating the transactions  contemplated hereby, and
no suit, action,  investigation,  inquiry or proceeding by any governmental body
or other person or legal or  administrative  proceeding  has been  instituted or
threatened which questions the validity or legality of the Selling Stockholder's
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  2.4 APPROVALS AND CONSENTS. The Selling Stockholder represents
that,  to his best  knowledge,  there  are no  permits,  consents,  mandates  or
approvals of public authorities,  either foreign, federal, state or local, or of
any third party  necessary  for the Selling  Stockholder's  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  2.5  INVESTMENT  AND  RELATED  REPRESENTATIONS.   The  Selling
Stockholder  is aware that  neither  the  Magnolia  Shares nor the offer or sale
thereof to the Selling Stockholder has been registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933,  as  amended  ("Securities  Act"),  or under any  foreign  or state
securities law. The Selling  Stockholder  acknowledges  that the Magnolia Shares
are being offered  pursuant to Section 4(2) of the  Securities  Act and that the
Magnolia  Shares will be  characterized  as "restricted"  securities  under U.S.


                                      -2-

federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired in a transaction not
involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable  regulations
such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only
in certain  limited  circumstances.  The  Selling  Stockholder  agrees  that the
Selling  Stockholder  will not sell all or any  portion of the  Magnolia  Shares
except  pursuant  to  registration  under the  Securities  Act or pursuant to an
available  exemption from  registration  under the  Securities  Act. The Selling
Stockholder  understands  that the certificate for Magnolia Shares issued to the
Selling  Stockholder  or to  any  subsequent  transferee  shall  be  stamped  or
otherwise  imprinted with an appropriate  legend  summarizing  the  restrictions
described  in this  Section 2.5 and that  Magnolia  shall refuse to transfer the
Magnolia Shares except in accordance with such restrictions.

         3.  MISCELLANEOUS.

                  3.1  CUMULATIVE  REMEDIES.  Any person having any rights under
any  provision  of this  Agreement  will be  entitled  to  enforce  such  rights
specifically,  to recover  damages by reason of any breach of any  provision  of
this  Agreement,  and to exercise all other rights  granted by law, which rights
may be exercised cumulative and not alternatively.

                  3.2  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Except as  otherwise  expressly
provided herein, all covenants and agreements  contained in this Agreement by or
on behalf of any of the parties hereto will bind and inure to the benefit of the
respective  successors and assigns of the parties hereto whether so expressed or
not.

                  3.3 SEVERABILITY.  Whenever  possible,  each provision of this
Agreement  will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable  law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
by or invalid under  applicable law, such provision will be ineffective  only to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of this Agreement or the other documents.

                  3.4  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement  may be executed in two or
more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party, but all such counterparts when taken together will constitute one and
the same agreement.

                  3.5 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire
agreement and  understanding  of the parties with respect to the subject  matter
thereof,   and   supersedes  all  prior  and   contemporaneous   agreements  and
understandings.

                  3.6 GOVERNING  LAW. The  validity,  meaning and effect of this
Agreement  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  laws of  California
applicable to contracts made and to be performed in California.  In the event of
any dispute under this Agreement,  the parties agree that the  jurisdiction  for
the resolution of any such dispute will be any appropriate  court located in Los
Angeles, California.
