incentive bonus policy adopted by the Bank effective January 1, 1987.</font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the management incentive bonus policy, individual performance awards are

Compensation Committee and the Bank Board consider the Corporation&#146;s total performance, including its growth rate, returns on average assets and equity, and absolute level of income.&#160; In addition, the Compensation Committee and the Bank
Board consider the individual performance of the members of management who may receive awards.&#160; The expense for these awards is accrued in the year of the specified performance.</font></p>
