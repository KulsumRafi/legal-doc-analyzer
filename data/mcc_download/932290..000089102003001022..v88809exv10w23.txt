         2.       DELIVERY OF STOCK CERTIFICATES

Within ten business days after the payment of the Purchase Price following the
exercise of this Warrant, the Company, at its expense, shall issue in the name
of the Holder (a) a certificate for the number of fully paid and nonassessable
Warrant Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise and
payment and (b) a new Warrant of like tenor to purchase up to that number of
Warrant Shares, if any, not previously purchased by the Holder if this Warrant
has not expired.

         3.       COVENANTS AS TO WARRANT SHARES

                  3.1      RESERVATION OF WARRANT SHARES

The Company shall at all times have authorized and reserve and keep available,
free from preemptive rights, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any
obligation to issue Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, the number
of Warrant Shares deliverable upon full exercise of this Warrant.

                  3.2      ISSUANCE OF WARRANT SHARES

The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares shall, upon issuance thereof in
accordance with the terms of this Warrant, be (a) duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and (b) free from all liens, pledges,
charges and security interests created by the Company. The Company shall pay all
taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed in respect of the
issuance or delivery of the Warrant Shares.

         4.       ADJUSTMENTS

                  4.1      ADJUSTMENTS OF EXERCISE PRICE AND NUMBER OF WARRANT
                  SHARES

The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter
provided in this Section 4.

                  4.2      ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE UPON EXTRAORDINARY
                  COMMON STOCK EVENT

Upon the happening of an Extraordinary Common Stock Event (as defined below)
after the issuance date of this Warrant, the Exercise Price shall,
simultaneously with the happening of such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, be
adjusted by multiplying the then effective Exercise Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such Extraordinary Common Stock Event and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such Extraordinary Common Stock Event, and the product so obtained shall
thereafter be the Exercise Price. The Exercise Price, as so adjusted, shall be
readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive Extraordinary
Common Stock Event or Events.

Upon each adjustment of such Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 4.2, this
Warrant shall thereafter entitle the Holder to purchase, at the Exercise Price
resulting from such adjustment, the number of Warrant Shares obtained by
multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by
the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately
prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the Exercise Price
resulting from such adjustment.

"Extraordinary Common Stock Event" shall mean (x) the issuance of additional
shares of Common Stock (or other securities or rights convertible into or
entitling the holder thereof to receive additional shares of Common Stock) as a
dividend or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock of the Company, (y) a
split or subdivision of outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number
of shares of Common Stock, or (z) a combination of outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock.

                  4.3      CAPITAL REORGANIZATION OR RECLASSIFICATION

If the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be changed
into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock
of the Company, whether by capital

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than an Extraordinary
Common Stock Event), then and in each such event the Holder shall have the right
thereafter to exercise this Warrant for the kind and amount of shares of stock
and other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization,
reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common
Stock into which this Warrant might have been converted immediately prior to
such reorganization, reclassification or change, all subject to adjustment as
provided herein. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the
application of the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the rights of
the Holder after the reorganization, recapitalization or change to the end that
the provisions of this Section 4 (including adjustment of the Exercise Price
then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant)
shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

                  4.4      NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENT

Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or property
issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted,
then and in each such case the Company shall promptly deliver a notice to the
Holder, which notice shall state the Exercise Price resulting from such
adjustment and/or the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares of
Common Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the
facts upon which such calculation is based.

                  4.5      OTHER NOTICES

In the event that the Company shall propose at any time:

         (a)      to declare any dividend or distribution upon its Common Stock,
                  whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether
                  or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of
                  earnings or earned surplus;

         (b)      to offer for subscription to the holders of its Common Stock
                  any additional shares of stock of any class or series or other
                  rights;

         (c)      to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of the
                  shares of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in
                  the Common Stock; or

         (d)      to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, to
                  sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its property
                  or business, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up;

         then, in connection with each such event, the Company shall send to the
         Holder:

         (i)      at least 20 days' prior written notice of the date on which a
                  record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or
                  subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the
                  holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto) or for
                  determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred
                  to in (c) and (d) above; and

         (ii)     in the case of the matters referred to in (c) and (d) above,
                  at least 20 days' prior written notice of the date when the
                  same shall take place (and, if applicable, specifying the date
                  on which the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
                  exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other
                  property deliverable upon the occurrence of such events).

         5.       FRACTIONAL SHARES

No fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. If any
fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section, be
issuable on the exercise of this Warrant (or any portion hereof), the Company
shall pay to the Holder an amount of cash equal to the then fair market value of
a Warrant Share multiplied by such fraction, computed to the nearest whole cent.
For purposes of the above calculation, the fair market value of a Warrant Share
shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid and asked prices of the
Company's Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System or on any
exchange on which such Common Stock is then listed, whichever is applicable, for
the five trading days prior to the date of exercise of this Warrant.

         6.       TRANSFERS

                  6.1      RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

No Warrant Shares or any interest therein may be transferred unless (a) such
transfer is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), (b) the Company has received an opinion of legal counsel for
the Holder reasonably satisfactory to the Company stating that the transfer is
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or (c) the
Company otherwise satisfies itself that such transfer is exempt from
registration.

                  6.2      TRANSFERS

The Company shall register on the books of the Company maintained at its
principal office the permitted transfer of this Warrant upon surrender to the
Company of this Warrant, with the form of Assignment attached hereto as Annex B
duly completed and executed by the Holder. Upon any such registration of
transfer, a new Warrant, in substantially the form of this Warrant, evidencing
this Warrant so transferred shall be issued, at the Company's expense, to the
transferee, and a new Warrant, in substantially the form of this Warrant,
evidencing the portion of this Warrant, if any, not so transferred shall be
issued, at the Company's expense, to the Holder.

         7.       REGISTRATION RIGHTS

                  (a) The Company shall notify the Holder in writing at least
                      thirty (30) days prior to filing any registration
                      statement under the Securities Act for purposes of
                      effecting a public offering of securities of the Company
                      (including, but not limited to, registration statements
                      relating to secondary offerings of securities of the
                      Company, but excluding registration statements relating to
                      any registration under Section 7(a) of this Warrant or to
                      any employee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization)
                      and will afford the Holder an opportunity to include in
                      such registration statement all or any part of the shares
                      issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, subject to the
                      provisions of Section 7(d) below. If the Holder wants to
                      include in any such registration statement all or any part
                      of the shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant,
                      the Holder shall within twenty (20) days after receipt of
                      the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the
                      Company in writing, and in such notice shall inform the
                      Company of the number of shares of Common Stock the Holder
                      wishes to include in such registration statement.

                  (b) If a registration statement under which the Company gives
                      notice under Section 7(a) is for an underwritten offering,
                      then the Company shall so advise the Holder. In such
                      event, the right of the Holder to include any of the
                      shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant in a
                      registration pursuant to Section 7(a) shall be conditioned
                      upon the Holder's participation in such underwriting and
                      the inclusion of the Holder's shares of Common Stock in
                      the underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the
                      other participants in such offering, including, without
                      limitation, entering into an underwriting agreement in
                      customary form with the managing underwriter or
                      underwriters selected for such underwriting (including a
                      market stand-off agreement of up to 180 days if required
                      by such underwriters). Notwithstanding any other provision
                      of this Warrant, if the managing underwriter(s)
                      determine(s) in good faith that marketing factors require
                      a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten,
                      then the managing underwriter(s) may exclude shares from
                      the registration and the underwriting, and the number of
                      shares that may be included in the registration and the
                      underwriting shall be allocated, first, to the Company,
                      second, to each holder of registration rights granted by
                      the Company before the issuance date of this Warrant that
                      contractually require the Company to include such holder's
                      shares on a priority basis, and, third, to the Holder and
                      any other holder of registration rights granted by the
                      Company (excluding those covered above), on a pro rata
                      basis based on the total number of shares of Common Stock
                      then sought to be included by each in such offering. If
                      the Holder disapproves of the terms of any such
                      underwriting, the Holder may elect to

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

                      withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and
                      the underwriter(s), delivered at least ten (10) business
                      days prior to the effective date of the registration
                      statement. Any shares of Common Stock excluded or
                      withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and
                      withdrawn from the registration.

                  (c) The Holder shall have no right to obtain or seek, nor
                      shall the Holder obtain or seek, an injunction restraining
                      or otherwise delaying any registration as the result of
                      any controversy that might arise with respect to the
                      interpretation or implementation of this Agreement.
