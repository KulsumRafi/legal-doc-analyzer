     WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the DIP Credit Agreement as set
forth herein and waive certain Events of Default that could arise under the DIP
Credit Agreement and in connection with the transactions described above;

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. Definitions; References. Unless otherwise specifically defined
herein, each capitalized term used herein which is defined in the DIP Credit
Agreement (as amended hereby) shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
the DIP Credit Agreement (as amended hereby). Each reference to "hereof",
"hereunder", "herein" and "hereby" and each other similar reference and


<PAGE>


each reference to "this Agreement" and each other similar reference contained in
the DIP Credit Agreement shall, after the date of effectiveness of this
Amendment and Waiver, refer to the DIP Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

     SECTION 2. New Definitions. (a) The following definitions are inserted in
alphabetical order in Section 1.01 of the DIP Credit Agreement:

     "Hanover" shall mean The Hanover Insurance Company.

     "Hanover Bond" shall mean any Pre-Petition Hanover Bond or Post-Petition
Hanover Bond.

     "Hanover Surety Credit Agreement" shall mean the Surety Credit Agreement
made as of October __, 2002 by and among Hanover, the Parent and the other Loan
Parties party thereto, as amended from time to time; provided that no amendment
or waiver thereof shall be effective for purposes of the Loan Documents unless
consented to by the Required DIP Lenders.

     "Pre-Petition Hanover Bond" shall mean, on any date, any surety bond
outstanding on such date so long as: (i) such surety bond (x) was issued prior
to the Petition Date by Hanover for the account of any Loan Party, and (y) is
listed on Schedule 1.01 hereto, or (ii) such surety bond is a renewal (a
"Renewal Surety Bond") of any surety bond described in clause (i) hereof (an
"Original Surety Bond") in accordance with the terms of the Hanover Surety
Credit Agreement, whether after cancellation of the relevant Original Surety
Bond or otherwise; provided that any Renewal Surety Bond shall be considered a
"Pre-Petition Hanover Bond" for purposes of the Loan Documents solely with
respect to the penal amount (the "Original Penal Amount") of the Original Surety
Bond as in existence immediately prior to the execution of the Hanover Surety
Credit Agreement that is renewed pursuant to such Renewal Surety Bond, and, to
the extent the penal amount of any Renewal Surety Bond exceeds such Original
Penal Amount of the relevant Original Surety Bond, such excess amount shall be
deemed to constitute a "Post-Petition Hanover Bond" for purposes of the Loan
Documents.

     "Post-Petition Hanover Bond" shall mean, on any date, any surety bond
outstanding on such date so long as such surety bond was issued by Hanover
pursuant to the Hanover Surety Credit Agreement after the Petition Date (subject
to the proviso set forth in clause (ii) of the definition of "Hanover
Pre-Petition Surety Bond") for the account of any Loan Party.

     "Specified Inter-Group Reimbursement Obligations" shall mean, with respect
to each Borrower, on any date, all obligations of such Borrower (an

                                       2


<PAGE>


"Advancing Borrower") to reimburse each Fronting Bank for amounts paid by it in
respect of drawings under Surety Letters of Credit issued in support of Hanover
Bonds for the account of such Borrower, to the extent the proceeds of such
drawings are used to indemnify Hanover for Losses (as defined in the Hanover
Surety Credit Agreement) arising after the Petition Date against any Hanover
Bond in accordance with Sections 7(e), 7(f), and 7(g) of the Hanover Surety
Credit Agreement and the applicable provisions provided for in Exhibit A
thereto, so long as any such Losses arise against any Hanover Bond issued for
the account of any Loan Party (a "Receiving Loan Party") which does not belong
to such Borrower's Borrower Group. Any Specified Inter-Group Reimbursement
Obligation shall constitute an Intercompany Advance made by the relevant
Advancing Borrower to the relevant Receiving Borrower. Further, an Intercompany
Advance shall be deemed to be created to reflect the proper allocation, in
accordance with the Cash Management Protocol, among the Borrower Groups in
connection with any cash used by a Loan Party to collateralize Hanover Bonds
(the "Advancing Loan Party") to the extent such collateral is used to indemnify
Hanover for Losses arising against any Hanover Bond issued for the account of
any Loan Party which does not belong to the same Borrower Group as the Advancing
Loan Party.

     (b) The definition of "Cash Management Protocol" contained in Section 1.01
of the DIP Credit Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

to this Agreement, as amended from time to time after notice and a hearing to
the extent required by the Final Order.

     (c) The definition of "Intercompany Advances" contained in Section 1.01 of

Party to another Loan Party, and shall include Specified Inter-Group
Reimbursement Obligations and any Intercompany Advance deemed created pursuant
to the last sentence of the definition of "Specified Inter-Group Reimbursement
Obligations".

     SECTION 3. Amendment to Requirement for Separate Surety Letters of Credit.
Section 2.04(d) of the DIP Credit Agreement is amended by adding the following
sentences at the end thereof:

     "; provided that, nothing in this sentence shall be construed to prohibit
any Borrower from obtaining any Surety Letter of Credit to support any Hanover
Bond, subject to the conditions herein set forth (including, without limitation,
the

                                       3


<PAGE>


provisions of Sections 2.04(a)(v) and 2.04(b)(v), Section 2.28 and Article 4).
Notwithstanding the proviso in the preceding sentence, the account party for any
Surety Letter of Credit issued to support a Hanover Bond shall only be the
Borrower for whose account such Hanover Bond has been issued (but without hereby
limiting the provisions of Section 2.30), and no Borrower or other Loan Party in
any Borrower Group other than the Borrower Group of which such account party is
a member and the Joint and Several Borrower Group shall be liable for
Reimbursement Obligations under such Surety Letter of Credit."

     SECTION 4. Amendment to Absolute Nature of Letter of Credit Obligations.

     "(v) the existence of any dispute under the Hanover Surety Agreement,
including without limitation any dispute as to which Hanover was entitled to
draw under any Surety Letter of Credit;"

     SECTION 5. Provisions Related to Specified Inter-Group Reimbursement
Obligations; Amended Definition of "Permitted Inter-Group Debt" and "Permitted
Inter-Group Advance". (a) Each Loan Party agrees that each Specified Inter-Group
Reimbursement Obligation shall have the benefit of the Liens and Guarantees
described in clause (v) of the proviso contained in Section 6.10(b) of the DIP
Credit Agreement. Such Liens and Guarantees shall be provided by (i) the
Receiving Loan Party, which shall constitute the "Ultimate Intercompany
Borrower" for purposes of such clause (v), (ii) each other Loan Party that is a
member of the same Borrower Group as such Loan Party and (iii) each Loan Party
that belongs to the Joint and Several Borrower Group. In addition, clause (v) of
the proviso contained in Section 6.10(b) of the DIP Credit Agreement is amended
by adding the phrase "each Loan Party that belongs to the Joint and Several
Borrower Group, and" immediately prior to the phrase "each other Loan Party" in
clause (ii) thereof.

     (b) Clause (w) of the proviso contained in Section 6.10(b) of the DIP
Credit Agreement is amended by adding the following proviso at the end thereof:
"; provided that the restrictions set forth in this clause (w) shall not apply
to any Permitted Inter-Group Debt described in clause (ii) of the definition
thereof or to any Permitted Inter-Group Advance described in clause (ii) of the
definition thereof;".

     (c) The definition of "Permitted Inter-Group Debt" contained in Section
6.10(b) of the DIP Credit Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as

be incurred by any Loan Party pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv) above and (ii)
any Specified Inter-Group Reimbursement Obligation.

6.10(b) of the DIP Credit Agreement is amended to read in its entirety as
follows:

     "Permitted Inter-Group Advance" means (i) any intercompany loan or advance
permitted to be made by any Loan Party pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv) above
and (ii) any intercompany loan or advance constituting a Specified Inter-Group
Reimbursement Obligation.

     SECTION 6. Waivers with respect to the Hanover Transaction. Each DIP Lender
hereby agrees to waive any Default or Event of Default arising under Section
7.01(l) of the DIP Credit Agreement, solely to the extent that such Default or
Event of Default arises as a result of any Loan Party making any Pre-Petition
Payment, so long as (i) any such Pre-Petition Payment shall be made with respect
to any Hanover Bond (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement as amended hereby)
or any outstanding and undisputed fees relating to obligations arising under
franchise and similar agreements or pole agreements, pole rental and other
similar agreements relating to cable and other property affixed to transmission
poles, and (ii) the Bankruptcy Court shall have approved any such Pre-Petition
Payment pursuant to an order authorizing the transactions contemplated by the
Hanover Surety Credit Agreement and the Liens and Guarantees described in
Section 5(a) of this Amendment and Waiver.

     SECTION 7. Reimbursement Obligations Under Surety Letters of Credit.
Notwithstanding paragraph 2 of the Cash Management Protocol, to the extent that
a Borrower has a Reimbursement Obligation to a Fronting Bank as a result of a
draw under a Surety Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (an
"Obligated Borrower"), such Obligated Borrower may borrow under the DIP Credit
Agreement on a non-pro rata basis for the purpose of obtaining funds to pay such
reimbursement obligation, subject to meeting the conditions to borrowing set
forth in the DIP Credit Agreement. No other Borrower or Loan Party shall be
obligated to or shall reimburse such Fronting Bank for such draw other than a
Loan Party in such Obligated Borrower's Borrower Group or in the Joint and
Several Borrower Group (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall
be construed to prohibit or limit the making by any Loan Party of any Permitted
Inter-Group Advance).

                                       5

     SECTION 8. Amendment of Concentration Account Provision. Section 5.12 of
the DIP Credit Agreement is amended by inserting the following sentence at the
end thereof:

     "The Parent shall cause the Franchise and Pole Fees Account (as such term
is defined in Section 7(d)(i) of the Hanover Surety Credit Agreement) to be
maintained at all times with the Administrative Agent."

     SECTION 9. Waiver of Requirement to Cause Century ML Become a Party to the
Loan Documents. Each DIP Lender hereby agrees to waive (a) the requirements,
arising under Section 5.13 of the DIP Credit Agreement, for the Parent (i) to
cause Century ML to become a party to each of the DIP Credit Agreement and the
Amended and Restated Security and Pledge Agreement and (ii) to cause the Final
Order to be applicable to Century ML, and (b) any Default or Event of Default
arising under Section 7.01(d) of the DIP Credit Agreement, solely as a result of
the non-compliance by the Parent with the requirements of Section 5.13 of the
DIP Credit Agreement described in this Section.

     SECTION 10. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AMENDMENT AND WAIVER AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE AND THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

     SECTION 11. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Amendment and Waiver may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Amendment and Waiver shall become effective as of the date
hereof when the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) duly executed
counterparts hereof signed by the Loan Parties and the Required DIP Lenders (or,
in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been
received, the Administrative Agent shall have received telegraphic, telex or
other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof
by such party), and (ii) a certified copy of the order of the Bankruptcy Court
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 5 of this Amendment and Waiver in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (it being
understood that such order will approve or effect an amendment to the Cash
Management Protocol giving effect to the matters effected by this Amendment and
Waiver, such amendment to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Required DIP Lenders). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Loan Parties and the DIP Lenders of the effectiveness of this Amendment and
Waiver, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
