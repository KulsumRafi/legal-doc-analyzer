                  (a) During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall be
            employed as Senior Vice President of Operations of the Company and
            will perform such other duties and services as, from time to time,
            are reasonably required by the Company's Chief Executive Officer,
            Chief Operating Officer or Board. The Executive shall be responsible
            for supervision of certain General Managers of the Company's
            operating properties and certain Corporate departments of the
            Company, as determined from time to time by the Company's Chief
            Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer. The Executive shall be
            appointed by the Board as a corporate executive officer of the
            Company at all times during the Term of Employment. The Executive
            will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief

            to the business and affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and
            Affiliates and shall use his or her best efforts, skills and
            abilities to promote the Company's interests. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, the Executive shall not be precluded from engaging in
            charitable and community affairs and managing his or her personal
            investments, as long as such activities do not materially detract
            from the Executive's performance of his or her duties under this
            Agreement. The Executive may serve as a member of the board of
            directors (or the equivalent) of corporations and limited liability
            companies, subject to the approval of a majority of the Board.

      3. COMPENSATION.

            3.1 BASE SALARY. During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall
      be entitled to receive a base salary (the "BASE SALARY") payable in
      monthly or more frequent installments as shall be established by the
      Company as its normal payroll practice from time to time or as required by
      applicable law at an annualized rate of no less than Three Hundred
      Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($300,000.00), subject to reduction for any
      and all applicable federal, state, and local withholding, social security
      and unemployment taxes. Such Base Salary shall be reviewed annually as of
      the anniversary of the date of this Agreement for increase (but not
      decrease) in the discretion of the Company. In conducting any such annual
      review, the Company shall consider any change in the Executive's
      responsibilities, the performance of the Executive and/or other factors
      deemed pertinent by the Company. Such increased Base Salary shall then
      constitute the Executive's "Base Salary" for purposes of this Agreement.

            3.2 ANNUAL BONUS. Based on merit and the financial performance of
      the Company, the Executive will be eligible to receive a discretionary
      bonus for each fiscal year of the Company equal to up to fifty percent
      (50%) of the Executive's weighted average Base Salary for such fiscal year
      ("ANNUAL BONUS"). Any Annual Bonus that may be awarded to the Executive
      shall be paid at the same time as annual bonuses are paid to other
      similarly situated management personnel of the Company, unless the
      Executive has elected to defer receipt of all or part of the bonus amounts
      to which he or she is entitled in respect of any such calendar year, in
      accordance with the terms and provisions of any Deferred Compensation Plan
      maintained by the Company.

            3.3 DEFERRED COMPENSATION. Subject to the approval of the
      Compensation Committee, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in
      the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms of that
      plan.

      4. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

            4.1 PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS. In addition to the benefits
      provided for in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, during the Term of Employment, the
      Executive shall be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans
      and programs made available to similarly situated senior management
      personnel of the Company generally, as such programs may be in effect from
      time to time, including, without limitation, pension and other retirement
      plans, profit sharing plans, group life insurance, group health insurance,
      group health supplemental insurance coverage through the Company's
      Exec-U-Care Medical Plan or a substitute plan, accidental death and
      dismemberment insurance, long-term disability, sick leave (including
      salary continuation arrangements), vacations, paid time off, holidays and
      other employee benefit programs as such plans and programs are exclusively
      described in written plan and program documents, subject to the
      eligibility criteria, rules, plan provisions and regulations applicable to
      such plans and programs and to the provisions of ERISA and the Code.
      Nothing contained herein shall be construed as negating or limiting the
      ability of the Company to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit
      programs or plans, in its sole discretion. The Executive's wage income
      subject to income taxation will include certain imputed amounts in respect
      of the life insurance benefits and primary group health plan benefits
      provided by the Company without cost to the Executive, but the Executive
      will not be required to contribute to the cost of these programs except as
      set forth in the last sentence of this Section. The amount of imputed
      income in respect of these benefits will be measured by the premium
      contribution that otherwise would be due from the Executive under the
      provisions of the plan but for the Company's waiver of the Executive's
      contribution requirements. The Executive will be responsible for making
      payment through payroll deduction of premiums for group long-term
      disability coverage if the Executive elects to enroll for such coverage;
      provided, however, that in such event, the gross amount of each payroll
      installment received by the Executive will be increased by an amount equal
      to any long-term disability premium deducted from such installment.

            4.2 RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAX LIABILITIES. Except as may otherwise be
      expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company shall not be responsible
      in any way for any income or other tax liabilities of the Executive due in
      connection with the receipt by the Executive of any compensation, benefits
      or perquisites from the Company.

      5. BUSINESS EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AND PERQUISITES.

            5.1 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. During the Term of Employment, the
      Executive shall be entitled to receive reimbursement by the Company for
      all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him or her in performing
      services under this Agreement, including any relocation expenses in
      accordance with Company policies, subject to

      providing the proper documentation of said expenses and to Company
      policies in effect from time to time with respect thereto.

            5.2 PERQUISITES. During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall
      also be entitled to the Company's perquisites provided to executive
      officers generally, including vacations and other paid time off, in
      accordance with the written terms and provisions of the documents
      exclusively defining applicable policies as in effect from time to time,
      including, without limitation:

                  (a) the Executive will receive hotel, food and beverage
            complimentary privileges for business and personal use at the
            properties operated by the Company's subsidiaries, including for the
            benefit of guests of the Executive whether or not the Executive is
            present; and

                  (b) the Executive will be eligible for complimentary use of
            the Company's condominiums in Sun Valley, Idaho, for so long as the
            Company retains such leased condominiums.

      6. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

            6.1 TERMINATION DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY. The Executive's
      employment shall be terminated immediately in the event of his or her
      death or Disability. In the event of a termination due to the Executive's
      death or Disability, the Executive or his or her beneficiary designated
      pursuant to Section 16, or if none, his or her estate, as the case may be,
      shall be entitled, in consideration of the Executive's obligations under
      Section 10 and in lieu of any other compensation whatsoever, to:

            other paid time off as of the termination of employment;

                  (e) such rights to other benefits as may be provided in

                        applicable written plan documents or agreements.

            6.2 TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY FOR CAUSE. The Company may terminate
      the Executive's employment for Cause at any time during the Term of
      Employment by giving written notice to the Executive that the Company

            stock rights and applicable employee benefit plans and programs,
            according to the terms and conditions of such documents and
            agreements;

                  (g) continuation of the Executive's group health insurance
            (including Exec-U-Care or substitute benefits), at the Company's
            expense, for eighteen (18) months after the termination of
            employment or, at the Company's option, payment to the Executive of
            the economic equivalent thereof, which shall constitute the
            provision of COBRA benefits to the Executive; and

                  (h) any and all amounts owed by the Company under Sections
            6.5(b), 6.5(c), 6.5(d) and 6.5(e) shall be paid by the Company
            within sixty (60) days of the date of termination of employment. Any
            and all amounts owed by the Company under Sections 6.5(f) and 6.5(g)
            shall be paid at the later of sixty (60) days following the date of
            termination or the date(s) specified under the applicable written
            plan documents or agreements.

            6.6 TERMINATION DUE TO EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. If
      either Party elects not to extend the initial Term of Employment or any
      successive Term of Employment, the Executive shall not be entitled to any
      additional compensation after the expiration thereof except as may be
      expressly provided for herein, but such termination of employment shall
      not otherwise affect accrued but unpaid compensation or benefits provided
      under this Agreement or pursuant to any Company plan or program.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company elects not to extend the
      initial Term of Employment or any successive Term of Employment, such
      election shall have the same consequences as a termination of the
      Executive's employment without Cause, effective as of the last day of the
      then current Term of Employment, unless the Executive's employment is
      otherwise terminated prior to the last day of the then current Term of
      Employment, in which case the consequences of such termination of
      employment shall be dependent upon the basis for such termination of
      employment as provided in this Agreement.

      7. CHANGE IN CONTROL.

            7.1 CHANGE IN CONTROL PAYMENT. Immediately upon a Change in Control,
      in addition to any other compensation or benefits payable pursuant to this
      Agreement or otherwise, the Executive shall be entitled to a payment in
      cash equal to one (1) times his or her annualized Base Salary, without
      regard to continued employment or termination thereof under this
      Agreement. Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the
      Executive's rights under a Change in Control to benefits under programs,
      plans and policies of the Company shall be determined according to the
      written terms and provisions of documents exclusively defining such
      programs, plans and policies.

      GOOD REASON AFTER A CHANGE IN CONTROL. If within twelve (12) months

      the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, the
      Executive shall be entitled, in addition to any payment paid or payable

            Control, whichever is greater, which shall be paid out in equal
            installments for the duration of the Restriction Period at the same
            frequency as the Company's regular payroll payments;

                  (b) earned but unpaid Base Salary through the date of
            termination of employment;

                  (c) any Annual Bonus earned pursuant to Section 3.2, in

            calendar year in which termination occurs, but not yet paid;

                  (d) reimbursement for expenses incurred but not paid prior to
            such termination of employment pursuant to Section 5.1;

            applicable written plan documents and agreements of the Company,
            including, without limitation, documents and agreements defining
            stock option rights, restricted stock rights and applicable employee
            benefit plans and programs, according to the terms and conditions of
            such documents and agreements;

                  (g) continuation of the Executive's group health insurance
            (including Exec-U-Care or substitute benefits), at the Company's
            expense, for eighteen (18) months after the termination of
            employment or, at the Company's option, payment to the Executive of
            the economic equivalent thereof, which shall constitute the
            provision of COBRA benefits to the Executive; and

                  (h) any and all amounts owed by the Company under Sections
            7.2(b), 7.2(c), 7.2(d) and 7.2(e) shall be paid by the Company

            under the applicable written plan documents or agreements.

            7.3 TERMINATION FOR OTHER REASONS AFTER A CHANGE IN CONTROL. If the
      Executive's employment is terminated after a Change in Control for any
      reason not otherwise provided for in this Section 7 (including without
      limitation a termination by the Company without Cause or a termination by
      the Executive for Good Reason more than twelve (12) months following the
      Change in Control), his or her rights shall be determined in accordance
      with the applicable subsection in Section 6.

      8. CONDITIONS TO PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION.

            8.1 TIMING OF PAYMENTS. Unless otherwise provided herein, any
      payments to which the Executive shall be entitled under Sections 6 and 7
      shall be payable upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this
      Agreement.

            8.2 NO MITIGATION; NO OFFSET. In the event of any termination of the
      Executive's employment under Section 6 or 7, the Executive shall be under
      no obligation to seek other employment, and there shall not be offset
      against amounts due to the Executive any remuneration attributable to any
      subsequent employment that the Executive may obtain. Notwithstanding any
      contrary provision contained herein, in the event of any termination of
      employment of the Executive, the exclusive remedies available to the
      Executive shall be the amounts due under Section 6 or 7, which are in the
      nature of liquidated damages, and are not in the nature of a penalty. In
      the event of a termination of this Agreement, neither Party shall publish
      in any way or make public any negative comment or statement about the
      other Party or concerning the reasons for such termination; provided,
      however, that this sentence shall not apply to written or oral testimony
      by either Party or their respective employees or agents or representatives
      in litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings in which the
      Parties are adverse. The provisions of this Section 8.2 shall survive the
      expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

            8.3 COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT. No payments or benefits payable
      to the Executive upon the termination of his or her employment pursuant to
      Section 6 or 7 shall be made to the Executive if he or she fails to comply
      with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without
      limitation, any provisions requiring the Executive to pay any amounts to
      the Company and Sections 10 and 11.

            8.4 PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION CONDITIONED ON RELEASE OF CLAIMS. Any
      payments to the Executive under Section 6 or 7 shall be subject to the
      condition that the Executive accepts and executes, without subsequent
      revocation, a release of claims substantially in the form attached hereto
      as Exhibit A.

            8.5 CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE. No act or omission by
      the Executive in breach of this Agreement, shall be deemed to permit the
      Executive to forego or waive such payments in order to avoid his or her
      obligations under Section 10 or 11.

      9. SPECIAL REIMBURSEMENT.

            9.1 GROSS-UP PAYMENT. If any payment or benefit paid or payable, or
      received or to be received, by or on behalf of the Executive in connection
      with a Change in Control pursuant to Section 7.1 or the termination of the
      Executive's employment pursuant to Section 7.2, whether any such payments
      or benefits are pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
      arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Affiliate of the Company,
      any Person, or otherwise (the "TOTAL PAYMENTS"), will or would be subject
      to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the "EXCISE
      TAX"), the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the
      "GROSS-UP PAYMENT") such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes
      (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes)
      imposed upon or in respect of the Gross-Up Payments, including, without
      limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with
      respect thereto) and any Excise Tax imposed thereon, the Executive retains
      an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
      Total Payments.

            9.2 DETERMINATION OF EXCISE TAX LIABILITY. For purposes of
      determining whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the
      Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, the Total Payments shall be
      treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)
      of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
      Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise
      Tax, unless it is reasonably determined by tax counsel or another
      professional adviser selected by the Company (which determination shall be
      provided to the Executive) that (i) such Total Payments (in whole or in
      part) do not constitute parachute payments, including (without limitation)
      by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (ii) such excess parachute
      payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for
      services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of
      the Code, or (iii) such Total Payments (in whole or in part) are not
      otherwise subject to the Excise Tax.

            9.3 REPAYMENT OBLIGATION. In the event that the Excise Tax is
      subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account
      hereunder, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the
      amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion
      of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction plus interest on
      the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B)
      of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the
      amount taken into account hereunder as of either the date of the Change in

      Control or the date of actual payment, whichever is applicable (including
      by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be
      determined at the time of the initial Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall
      make an additional Gross-Up Payment in accordance with Section 9.1 in
      respect of such excess Excise Tax (plus any interest, penalties or
      additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess Excise Tax)
      at the time that the amount of such excess Excise Tax is finally
      determined. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate
      with each other in connection with any administrative or judicial
      proceedings concerning the existence or amount of any such subsequent
      liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

      10. COVENANT NOT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTS.

            10.1 GENERAL. The Parties understand and agree that the purpose of
      the restrictions contained in this Section 10 is to protect the goodwill
      and other legitimate business interests of the Company, and that the
      Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such
      restrictions. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions
      are reasonable and do not, and will not, unduly impair his or her ability
      to make a living after the termination of his or her employment with the
      Company. The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or
      sooner termination of this Agreement.

            10.2 NON-ASSISTANCE; NON-DIVERSION. In consideration for this
      Agreement to employ the Executive and the other valuable consideration
      provided hereunder, the Executive agrees and covenants that during the
      Term of Employment and during the Restriction Period, and except when
      acting on behalf of the Company or on behalf of any Affiliate of the
      Company, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, for himself or
      herself or any third party, or alone or as a member of a partnership or
      limited liability company, or as an officer, director, shareholder, member
      or otherwise, engage in the following acts:

            Area;

                  (c) accept any position or affiliation or assignment or render
            any services (whether as an independent contractor or employee)
            within the corporate, divisional or regional headquarters or
            corporate, divisional or regional management group of any Competing
            Business whose operations and properties include one or more casinos
            within the Restricted Area; or

                  (d) hire or retain any employee of the Company or any
            Affiliate of the Company to provide services for any other Person,
            or induce, solicit, attempt to solicit, encourage, divert, cause or
            attempt to cause any employee or prospective employee of the Company
            or any Affiliate of the Company to (i) terminate and/or leave such
            employment or (ii) accept employment with anyone other than the
            Company or an Affiliate of the Company.

            10.3 CESSATION/REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYMENTS. If the Executive violates
      any provision of this Section 10, the Company may, upon giving written
      notice to the Executive, immediately cease all payments and benefits that
      it may be providing to the Executive pursuant to Section 3, Section 4,
      Section 6 and Section 7.2, and the Executive shall be required to
      reimburse the Company for any payments received from, and the cash value
      of any benefits provided by, the Company between the first day of the
      violation and the date such notice is given; provided, however, that the
      foregoing shall be in addition to such other remedies as may be available
      to the Company and shall not be deemed to permit the Executive to forego
      or waive such payments in order to avoid his or her obligations under this
      Section 10; and provided, further, that any release of claims by the
      Executive pursuant to Section 8.4 shall continue in effect.

            10.4 SURVIVAL. The Executive agrees that the provisions of this
      Section 10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the

      Affiliates, employees, agents, successors, attorneys, and assigns)
      relating in any manner whatsoever to the employment of or termination of

      14. RIGHT TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The Executive acknowledges that a
violation on his or her part of any of the covenants contained in Sections 10
and 11 would cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the Company. The
Executive accordingly agrees and hereby grants his or her consent that, without
limiting the remedies available to the Company, any actual or threatened
violation of such covenants may be enforced by injunctive relief or by other
equitable remedies issued or ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction.

      15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENTS. In the event that any terms or
provisions of this Agreement conflict with the terms and provisions of any
employee benefit plan document, the terms and provisions of such employee
benefit plan document shall govern; and the Company shall take any and all
actions that may be necessary, including amendment of any plan document, to the
extent necessary to effect the provision of benefits expressly provided upon
termination of the Executive's employment pursuant to Sections 6 and 7.

      16. BENEFICIARIES/REFERENCES. The Executive shall be entitled to select a
beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit payable
hereunder following the Executive's death, and may change such election, by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of the Executive's death
or a judicial determination of his or her incompetence, reference in this
Agreement to the Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his
or her beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.

      17. SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall survive the expiration or any earlier termination of this
Agreement to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights
and obligations. The provisions of this Section 17 are in addition to the
survivorship provisions of any other Section of this Agreement.

      18. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Party represents and warrants
that he or she or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or her or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between that Party and any other
Person.

      19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement and
any contemporaneous documents expressly setting forth an agreement between the
Parties and expressly identified in this Agreement contain the entire agreement
between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, discussions, negotiations and undertakings, whether
written or oral, express or implied, between the Parties with respect hereto. No
representations, inducements, promises or agreements not embodied herein shall
be of any force or effect.

      20. ASSIGNABILITY; BINDING NATURE. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, heirs
and assigns; provided, however, that no rights or obligations of the Executive
under this Agreement may be

assigned or transferred by the Executive, other than rights to compensation and
benefits hereunder, which may be transferred only by will or operation of law
and subject to the limitations of this Agreement.

      21. AMENDMENT OR WAIVER. No provision in this Agreement may be amended or
waived unless such amendment or waiver is agreed to in writing and signed by
both Parties. No waiver by one Party of any breach by the other Party of any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other Party
shall be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at
the same or any prior or subsequent time. No failure of either Party to exercise
any power given to such Party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by
the other Party with any obligation hereunder, and no custom or practice at
variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of the right of such
Party to demand strict compliance with the terms hereof.

      22. SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision or portion of this
Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in
whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected
thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent
permitted by law. Without limiting the foregoing, if any portion of Section 10
is held to be unenforceable, the maximum enforceable restriction of time, scope
of activities and geographic area will be substituted for any such restrictions
held unenforceable.

      23. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without reference
to the principles of conflict of laws thereof. In the event of any dispute or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is brought to a
court, the Parties mutually and irrevocably consent to, and waive any objection
to, the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction sitting in Clark County, Nevada, to resolve such dispute or
controversy; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 23 shall affect the
Parties' agreement in Section 12 hereinabove that arbitration under Section 12
shall apply to all disputes under this Agreement other than as provided in
Section 12.4.

      24. INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent not otherwise required by law or the
Indemnification Agreement, the Company will consider in good faith, and
consistent with the Company's past practices, requests by the Executive for
indemnification against claims arising from the Executive's conduct in the
course and scope of the Executive's employment under this Agreement and for
advancement of expenses reasonably incurred in defending against such claims.

      25. HEADINGS. The headings of the Sections and Subsections contained in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or
affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

counterpart of this Agreement and reattached to any other counterpart of this
Agreement identical in form hereto but having attached to it one or more
additional signature pages.

      27. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. The Executive represents and acknowledges the
following:

                  (a) he or she has carefully read this Agreement in its
            entirety;

            she has not relied on any statements made by the Company or its
            legal counsel as to the meaning of any term or condition contained
            herein or in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement; and

                  (d) he or she is entering into this Agreement knowingly and
            voluntarily.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement as of the

                           GENERAL AND SPECIAL RELEASE

      This Separation Agreement and General and Special Release ("Agreement") is
made by and between ANGELA R. BAKER (the "Executive") and AMERISTAR CASINOS,
INC., a Nevada corporation ("Company"), with respect to separation payments to
be paid to the Executive conditioned in part on a complete release by the

      In consideration of delivery to the Executive of the severance payments
and benefits by the Company conditionally promised by the Company in that
certain Executive Employment Agreement by and between the Executive and the
Company dated as of June 5, 2002 (the "Employment Agreement") and with the sole
exception of those obligations expressly recited herein or to be performed
hereunder and of the Executive's claims to vested interests the Executive may
have in employee benefit plans, stock options or restricted stock as defined
exclusively in written documents, the Executive and the Executive's heirs,
successors and assigns do hereby and forever release and discharge the Company
and its affiliated entities and their past and present directors, officers,
employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives, successors and
assigns from any and all causes of action, actions, judgments, liens,

Agreement, including but not limited to any claim for breach of contract, breach

or local labor or fair employment law under which a claim might be brought were
it not released here, all as amended from time to time.

      The Executive assumes the risk of any mistake of fact and of any facts
which are unknown, and thereby waives any and all claims that this release does
not extend to claims which the Executive does not know or suspect to exist in
his or her favor at the time of
