         THIS SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE (this "Agreement") is made by and
between Parker Drilling Company ("Company") and James Davis ("Employee").

                                     PURPOSE

         Company and Employee have reached a mutual agreement that Employee's
employment will terminate on September 26, 2002 ("the Termination Date") as a
result of Employee's desire to pursue outside interests. To achieve a final and
amicable resolution of the employment relationship in all its aspects and in
consideration of the mutual covenants and promises herein contained and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiently of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                      COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY

         Payment of Separation Benefits: In recognition of Employee's past
service to the Company and in consideration of the release and the conditions
contained herein, the Company shall provide the Employee with the following:

               o    A severance payment in a lump sum amount of Seven Hundred
                    Forty-three Thousand One Hundred Eighty-seven dollars
                    ($743,187.00).

               o    Continued use of the Company's country club membership at
                    Pine Forest Country Club until September 30, 2003. The
                    Company will only reimburse the normal monthly dues.

               o    Continued coverage under that certain split dollar life
                    insurance policy until the earlier of the date Employee
                    becomes employed with another company or September 30, 2003.
                    Notwithstanding the above, in the event provisions of the
                    policy precludes the Company from continuing such coverage
                    or in the event regulatory, legal or tax requirements,
                    changes or actions causes the continuation of such coverage
                    to be detrimental to the Company as solely determined by the
                    Company, such continued coverage will be terminated as soon
                    as reasonably practical. Employee agrees that at such time
                    that coverage terminates, he will

                    expeditiously provide the Company any required
                    documentation, including but not limited to the assignment
                    of the policy if so required.

                    contribution cost to Employee) until the earlier of the date
                    Employee becomes eligible for group health care coverage
                    with another employer or September 30, 2003. In the event
                    Employee has not become eligible for group health care
                    coverage by September 30, 2003, he and his spouse will be
                    eligible for coverage under the COBRA provisions of the
                    Company's group health plan and be responsible for remitting
                    the applicable COBRA contributions that may be in effect
                    from time to time.

               o    Certain executive outplacement benefits from the firm Drake,
                    Beam and Morin, the scope and extent of which shall be at
                    Company's discretion.

               o    Ownership of the laptop computer Employee is currently using
                    in his capacity as an employee. Employee agrees and
                    understands that the Company will delete all company files
                    from the hard drive prior to transfer of ownership to
                    Employee.

               o    Extension of Employee's stock options through September 30,
                    2004. Any stock options which are not presently vested will
                    continue to vest in accordance with their respective vesting
                    schedules. In any event, all of Employee's stock options
                    will terminate the earlier of the respective option grant or
                    on September 30, 2004.

               o    Continuation of the Mortgage Buydown Assistance Allowance
                    payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
                    2001 Parker Drilling Company Relocation policy.
