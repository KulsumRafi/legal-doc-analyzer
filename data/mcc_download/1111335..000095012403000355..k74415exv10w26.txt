         conversion in an amount determined as provided in Section 2.18 with
         respect to prepayments.

                  (g) At the time that the Company (on behalf of itself or an
Affiliate) or Special Purpose Borrower gives a notice to extend or convert any
Loan pursuant to the requirements of this Section 2.12, each Bank shall
telephonically notify the Company or the Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable, and the Administrative Agent whether such Bank will require a
Gross-up for withholding taxes in connection with such Loan as so extended or
converted (as provided in Section 10.4). A notice to extend or convert any Loan,
once given to the Administrative Agent, shall not be revocable by the Company or
Special Purpose Borrower, except in the event that any Bank notifies the Company
or Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, at the time it gives notice to
extend or convert a Loan that a Gross-up will be required, in which case, the
Company (on behalf of itself or the Affiliate) or Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable, may promptly withdraw the notice to extend or convert the Loan.

         2.13 REGISTER

         The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Company, the
Affiliates and the Special Purpose Borrower, maintain at one of its offices a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the
Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Bank from
time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive,
in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the Affiliates, the Special
Purpose Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans (and any Notes
evidencing the Loans) recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any
assignment of any Loan pursuant to Section 9.1, whether or not evidenced by a
Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto
being made in the Register (and any Note evidencing such Loan shall expressly so
provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan shall be
registered on the Register only upon

                                                                              15

thereof, as follows:

         (i) with respect to each Base Rate Loan, at a fluctuating rate per
     annum equal to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time
     while such Base Rate Loan is outstanding and (y) the Base Rate Margin; and

         (ii) with respect to each Eurodollar Loan, during each Interest Period
     applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (x) the LIBO

         (b) Interest on Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 (or 366) days and paid for the actual number of days for which due.
Interest on Eurodollar Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and paid for the actual number of days for which due. Interest for each
Interest Period with respect to a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated from and
including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof.

         2.15 INTEREST PAYMENT DATES

         Interest on each Loan shall be payable as follows:

         (a) with respect to each Base Rate Loan, on each March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31 that such Loan is outstanding, and upon payment in
full of such Loan; and

         (b) with respect to each Eurodollar Loan, (i) if the current Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Loan is one month, two months or three months, on the
last day of such Interest Period or (ii) if the current Interest Period for such

1% plus the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time while such Loan
is overdue and (y) the Base Rate Margin; and

         (b) (i) with respect to overdue principal on each Eurodollar Loan, at a
daily rate, which shall be calculated by the Administrative Agent (whose

<PAGE>
                                                                              16


in the absence of manifest error) and shall be a rate per annum equal to the sum
of (A) 1% plus (B) the Eurodollar Margin plus (C) the LIBO Rate, and (ii) with
respect to overdue interest on each Eurodollar Loan, at the rate per annum equal

per annum at which deposits in the amount of such overdue interest are offered
to the Administrative Agent by other leading banks, as determined by the
Administrative Agent, in the London interbank market for a period of one day, or
if no such rate is available, one month (or, if such amount remains unpaid more
than three Eurodollar Business Days, then for such other period of time not
longer than six months as the Administrative Agent may elect).

         2.17 DATES FOR PAYMENT OR OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL

         Each of the Company, each Affiliate and the Special Purpose Borrower
unconditionally promises to repay the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made
to it on the Maturity Date. Each of the Company, each Affiliate and the Special
Purpose Borrower may, at its option, prepay the principal amount of any Loan
made to it, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, as follows:

              (a) with respect to any Base Rate Loan, on any Domestic Business
Day, provided that the Company (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate) or the
Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, deliver an irrevocable notice of
prepayment to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on such date, which notice shall specify the date and amount of
prepayment; and

              (b) with respect to any Eurodollar Loan on the last day of any
Interest Period therefor, provided that the Company (on behalf of itself or an
Affiliate) or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, deliver an
irrevocable notice of prepayment to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, three Eurodollar Business Days prior to such date,
which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment;

in each case together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of
prepayment. Amounts prepaid on account of the Loans may not be reborrowed.
Partial prepayments of any Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof

         2.18 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT ON OTHER DATES; REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN
COSTS

         The Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, may, at its
option, prepay the principal amount of any Eurodollar Loan made to it, in whole
or in part, at times other than those provided for in Section 2.17(b), in each
case together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of
prepayment; provided, however, that with respect to any such Loan the Company,
the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, whichever is the borrower, shall
reimburse each Bank on demand for any loss incurred by such Bank as a result of
the timing of such payment, including without limitation, any loss incurred in
liquidating or re-employing deposits from third parties but excluding loss of
the Eurodollar Margin or any other profit for the period after such payment,
provided that the amount of such loss shall in no event exceed the amount of
interest that would have accrued from the date of prepayment to the last day of
the then-current Interest Period in the


<PAGE>
                                                                              17


absence of prepayment, and the relevant Bank shall have delivered to the Company
and, if the Company is not the borrower, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose
Borrower, as applicable, a written statement setting forth the basis for
determining such loss, which written statement shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error. The Bank shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate
any loss resulting from any prepayment by the Company, the Affiliate or the
Special Purpose Borrower.

         2.19 METHOD OF PAYMENT

         All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
made in immediately available funds (i) with respect to the Commitment Fee, in
United States dollars to the account in the continental United States designated
by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.3, (ii) with respect to
payments relating to Loans (including, without limitation, principal, interest,
any Gross-up or any payments pursuant to Section 2.18 or 10.3), in United States
dollars to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks at (A) the
Domestic Funding Office, with respect to each Domestic Loan, (B) the Eurodollar
Funding Office, with respect to each Eurodollar Loan or (C) at such other
location as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Company, the
Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, and (iii) with respect
to any other payment due hereunder, in such currency and in such place or office
as may be required hereunder or as may be agreed upon by the Administrative
Agent and the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks
promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, any Domestic Loan or of the Commitment Fee shall
be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day and, in
the case of a payment of principal, interest thereon shall be payable for such
extended time. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, any
Eurodollar Loan shall be due on a day which is not a Eurodollar Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Eurodollar
Business Day, unless as a result thereof such date would fall in the next
calendar month, in which case, such date shall be advanced to the next preceding
Eurodollar Business Day, and, in the case of a payment of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable to the date of payment as extended or advanced as the
case may be.

         2.20 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS

              (a) Each Borrowing by the Company, any Affiliate or the Special
Purpose Borrower from the Banks hereunder, each payment by the Company, an
Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower on account of the Commitment Fee and
any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall be made pro rata according
to the respective undrawn Commitments of the Banks.

              (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Company on
account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro rata
according to the respective outstanding amounts of principal and interest then
due and owing to the Banks.

              (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Bank prior to a Borrowing that such Bank will not make the amount
that would constitute its


<PAGE>
                                                                              18

share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank is making such amount available
to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. If such
amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on
the Borrowing date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand,
such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for
the period until such Bank makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's share of such Borrowing is not
made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within three Domestic
Business Days after such Borrowing date, the Administrative Agent shall also be
entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum
applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Company, the Affiliate or the
Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable.

              (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable, prior to the date of any payment due to be made by it hereunder that
the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, will
not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Administrative Agent may
assume that the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable, is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall
not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Banks their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such
payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Company, the Affiliate or
the Special Purpose Borrower within three Domestic Business Days after such due
date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from
each Bank to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding
sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the
daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against the Company,
any Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable.

         2.21 REPAYMENT OF BILATERAL OBLIGATIONS; TERMINATION OF BILATERAL
COMMITMENTS

         The Commitment of each Bank hereunder and the other agreements
contained herein are conditioned upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of
evidence of repayment by the Company of all amounts of principal and interest
outstanding under those Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreements which have not
been previously terminated. Subject to the foregoing, the Company, the
Affiliates and the Banks agree that any commitment of any Bank to make loans to
the Company and any Affiliate pursuant to the terms of any Bilateral Revolving
Credit Agreement, to the extent not previously terminated, shall terminate as of
the Effective Date, and each Bank party to one or more Bilateral Revolving
Credit Agreements whose commitment has not been previously terminated agrees to
waive any notice required by such Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreement with
regards to the Company's termination of such Bank's commitment. The termination
of each such Bank's commitment under its respective Bilateral Revolving Credit
Agreement shall not affect or terminate any outstanding payment obligations of
the Company or


<PAGE>
                                                                              19


any Affiliate owing or arising under such Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreement,
which obligations shall continue until satisfied in their entirety.

SECTION 3. [RESERVED]

SECTION 4. GUARANTEE OF LOANS TO AFFILIATES AND THE SPECIAL PURPOSE BORROWER

              (a) The Company hereby guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for
the ratable benefit of the Banks and their affiliates, the due and punctual
payment of the principal of and interest on any Loans made to any Affiliate or
Special Purpose Borrower under this Agreement and any other Obligations of any
Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank
under this Agreement or its Accession Memorandum (the "Guaranteed Obligations")
when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, upon
declaration or otherwise, according to the terms thereof. Upon the occurrence of
an Affiliate Event of Default with respect to an Affiliate or Special Purpose
Borrower hereunder, the Company shall on behalf of the Affiliate or Special
Purpose Borrower, as applicable, upon demand by the Administrative Agent
punctually make any payment due and payable by the Affiliate or Special Purpose
Borrower under this Agreement or its Accession Memorandum, whether at maturity,
upon declaration or otherwise; and any such payment shall be treated for the
purposes of such Accession Memorandum and this Agreement (other than Section
10.4) as if such payment were made by the Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower,
as applicable.

              (b) The Company hereby agrees that its obligations under this
Section 4 shall be irrevocable and unconditional and that the Company shall not
have the right to assert any defenses based upon (i) the validity, regularity or
enforceability of any Accession Memorandum or this Agreement or any Note, (ii)
the absence of any attempt to collect from the defaulting Affiliate or Special
Purpose Borrower, as applicable, or other action to enforce the same, (iii) any
dispute between the Company and the Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower or any
Person holding an ownership interest in the Special Purpose Borrower, including
any claim by the Company against the Special Purpose Borrower or Person holding
an ownership interest in the Special Purpose Borrower in connection with the
Special Purpose Borrower's conduct in respect to the New Corporate Offices, (iv)
the waiver or consent by the Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to
any provisions thereof or hereof (other than with respect to this Section 4), or
(v) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of the Company or of a guarantor.

              (c) With respect to its obligations under this Section 4, the
Company waives filing of claims with a court, trustee or receiver in the event
of receivership or bankruptcy of the defaulting Affiliate or Special Purpose
Borrower, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest or notice with
respect to Guaranteed Obligations and all demands whatsoever (other than that
provided for in subsection (a) above), and covenants that this Guarantee is a
continuing guarantee and will not be discharged except by complete performance
of the Guaranteed


<PAGE>
                                                                              20


Obligations of the defaulting Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower and the
obligations of the Company under this Guarantee.

              (d) To the extent of any payment by the Company to the
Administrative Agent or any Bank under this Section 4, the Company shall succeed
to all corresponding claims that the Administrative Agent or such Bank may have
and otherwise be subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent or such
Bank against the defaulting Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower or any other
person or security in connection with the Loans to the defaulting Affiliate or
Special Purpose Borrower, and the Administrative Agent and any such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in seeking recovery under
such claims.

              (e) The Company's obligations under this Section 4 constitute a
guarantee of payment and not of collection merely and shall remain in full force
and effect with respect to each Affiliate and Special Purpose Borrower until the
Guaranteed Obligations of such Affiliates and Special Purpose Borrower shall
have been paid in full in accordance with the terms of the relevant Accession
Memorandum and of this Agreement. If at any time any payment of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations of an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower or
otherwise, the Company's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment
shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not been made.

              (f) If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the
Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank of
any Guaranteed Obligations of the Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower is
stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or proposed compromise or
arrangement with creditors of the Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower, all
such Guaranteed Obligations of which payment or performance is stayed that would
otherwise be subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be
payable by the Company under this Section 4 immediately on demand by the
Administrative Agent or such Bank.

shall not be entitled to receive any greater interest or other payment by reason
of Section 10.3 or 10.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the rights so transferred or assigned unless such transfer or
assignment is made by reason of the provisions of Section 10.2, 10.3 or 10.4
requiring the Bank to designate a different lending office under certain
circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater
payment did not exist.

               (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Bank may assign
any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Bank

a Conduit Bank any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year
and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper
note issued by such Conduit Bank; provided, however, that each Bank designating
any Conduit Bank hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other
party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability
to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Bank during such period of
forbearance.

         9.2 PARTICIPATION IN LOANS

         Each Bank shall have the right to sell to any bank or other financial
institution (a "Participant") a participating interest in such Bank's Commitment
or in the Loans held by such Bank; provided, however, that, following any such
sale, (a) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unmodified
and fully effective and enforceable against such Bank, (b) such Bank shall
remain solely responsible to the Company, the Affiliates and the Special Purpose
Borrower for the performance of such obligations, including, without limitation,
its Commitment and the obligation of such Bank to fund Loans hereunder, (c) the
Administrative Agent and the Company, the Affiliates and the Special Purpose
Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection
with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (d) such Bank
shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Company, the Affiliates and the Special Purpose Borrower hereunder, including,
without limitation, the sole right to approve of or consent to any action

may grant to a Participant a joint right to approve of or consent to any action,
amendment, modification or waiver that would (i) reduce the amount or extend the
time for payment (other than pursuant to Section 2.12) of any principal of, or
interest on, the Loans, (ii) increase the amount of such Bank's Commitment or
(iii) reduce the amount of the Commitment Fee, in each case, from that in effect
at the time of the sale of the participating interest, provided that if such
Bank so grants to a Participant a right to approve of or consent to a reduction
in the Commitment Fee, the term of the participating interest sold to such
Participant shall not extend beyond, and unless earlier terminated such
participating interest shall automatically terminate on, the day immediately
prior to the day and month of the Effective Date next following the sale of

<PAGE>
                                                                              35


such participating interest, and (e) any such participating interest shall be in
a minimum amount of $5,000,000 on the date the participating interest is sold.
On the month and day of the Effective Date of each year (or, if any such month
and day of the Effective Date is not a Domestic Business Day, on the next
succeeding Domestic Business Day), each relevant Bank shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent and the Company a written notice disclosing the name of
each Participant which held a participating interest in such Bank's Commitment
or any Loan held by such Bank at any time during the 12-month period ended on
the day immediately prior to the day and month of the Effective Date next
preceding such date. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 10.3 or 10.4 than the applicable Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Company's prior written consent. Any Participant that is a foreign person (i.e.,
a person organized or incorporated under the laws of a country other than the
United States of America) shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.4
unless such Participant complies with Section 10.4(c).

         9.3 ASSIGNMENT BY THE COMPANY, AFFILIATES OR SPECIAL PURPOSE BORROWER

         None of the Company, the Affiliates or the Special Purpose Borrower may
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of each Bank, provided that (a) the Company and any
Affiliate may transfer existing Loans and obligations with respect thereto to
the Special Purpose Borrower by written notice to the Administrative Agent at
the time the Special Purpose Borrower delivers its Accession Memorandum to the
Administrative Agent and complies with the other conditions set forth in Section
5.2(b) and (b) the Special Purpose Borrower may assign any Loans made or
assigned to it to the Company or any Affiliate at any time upon written notice
to the Administrative Agent. In the event of any assignment of Loans pursuant to
this Section, the Administrative Agent make appropriate entries in the Register
to reflect such transfer and the assignee shall be treated as the borrower of
the assigned Loans for all purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall any
assignment of Loans from the Company or an Affiliate to the Special Purpose
Borrower, or from the Special Purpose Borrower to an Affiliate, pursuant to the
terms of this Section 9.1(c) release the Company or the Affiliates from its
other obligations under this Agreement including, in the case of the Company,
its guarantee obligations under Section 4 with respect to the assigned Loans.

SECTION 10. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

         10.1 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR

         The Banks shall have no obligation to make a new Eurodollar Loan, to
extend an outstanding Eurodollar Loan or to convert an outstanding Loan into a
Eurodollar Loan if the Administrative Agent determines that:

               (a) by reason of circumstances generally affecting all interbank
markets for deposits in United States dollars (in the applicable amounts), LIBO
Rates for such deposits are not being offered to the Banks for a term equal to
any Interest Period for which such new Loan, extended Loan or converted Loan
shall be requested by the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower;
or
<PAGE>
                                                                              36


               (b) based on notice received from the Required Banks, the LIBO
Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of maintaining
or funding such new Loan, extended Loan or converted Loan as shall be requested
by the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower.

Upon any such determination, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or
telephonic notice thereof to the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose
Borrower and the Banks as soon as practicable. If such notice is given pursuant
to this Section 10.1, then (i) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the
first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (ii) any
Base Rate Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such
Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and
(iii) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of
the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans. Until such relevant notice
has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans
shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Company, the Affiliates or the
Special Purpose Borrower have the right to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Loans.

         10.2 ILLEGALITY

               (a) If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of, or
any change in, any applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental, monetary, or regulatory authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any
Bank with any request or directive of any such authority shall make it unlawful
for such Bank to make, maintain or fund any Loan, such Bank shall give notice
thereof to the Company and, if the Loan is to an Affiliate of the Special
Purpose Borrower, to such Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower (in each case
with a copy to the Administrative Agent). Before giving any notice pursuant to
this Section 10.2, the relevant Bank shall designate a different lending office
if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and it would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank in its reasonable judgment. Upon
receipt of such notice the Company shall or, if the Loan is to an Affiliate or
the Special Purpose Borrower, such Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower shall
on either (A) the last day of the then-current Interest Period applicable to
such Loan if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to
such day or (B) not later than the last date such Bank may lawfully continue to
fund and maintain such Loan, either (i) prepay in full, without premium or
penalty, the then outstanding principal amount of each affected Loan, together
with accrued interest thereon or (ii) convert such Loan into another category of
Loan (which would not be unlawful for the relevant Banks to make) as provided in
Section 2.12.

               (b) Upon any prepayment or conversion of a Loan made pursuant to
Section 10.2(a) other than at the end of an Interest Period, the Company or the
Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, shall reimburse the Bank
upon demand for any loss incurred by it as a result of the timing of such
prepayment or conversion, in the manner provided in Section 2.18.
<PAGE>
                                                                              37


         10.3 INCREASED COST

              (a) If (i) Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as in effect
on the Effective Date ("Regulation D"), (ii) minimum reserve requirements of the
Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority as in effect on the
Effective Date ("Mandatory Cost Rate"), or (iii) after the date hereof, the
adoption of any applicable law or regulation, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive
of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency (a "Regulatory
Change"):

              (A) shall subject any Bank to any tax, duty or other charge with
         respect to Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans,
         or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to such Bank of the
         principal of or interest on Eurodollar Loans or any other amounts due
         under this Agreement in respect of Eurodollar Loans or its obligation
         to make Eurodollar Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
         overall net income of such Bank or the Eurodollar Lending Office
         imposed by the jurisdictions in which such Bank's principal executive
         office or Eurodollar Lending Office are located); or

              (B) shall impose, modify or cause to be applicable any reserve
         (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Federal Reserve
         Board), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
         deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Bank
         or the Eurodollar Lending Office or shall impose on such Bank (or the
         Eurodollar Lending Office) or all interbank markets applicable to such
         Eurodollar Loans any other condition affecting the Eurodollar Loans or
         its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
the Eurodollar Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans, or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or the
Eurodollar Lending Office) under this Agreement, by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower,
as applicable, shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for any such increased cost or reduction incurred or
suffered by such Bank from and after the later of (i) the date that is 15 days
prior to receipt of notice from such Bank of such costs and (ii) the last date
preceding receipt of such notice from such Bank on which interest was due and
payable pursuant to Section 2.15 on any such Eurodollar Loan. Any Bank which
provides notice to the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower of
increased costs pursuant to this Section 10.3(a) shall also provide a copy of
such notice to the Administrative Agent.

              (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, so long as any
Bank shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurodollar liabilities"
under Regulation D (or, so long as such Bank may be required, by any Mandatory
Cost Rate or by reason of any Regulatory Change, to maintain reserves against
any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this
Agreement or


<PAGE>
                                                                              38


against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of
such Bank which includes any Eurodollar Loans) (such reserves are collectively
called "Reserves") the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as
applicable, shall pay to such Bank an amount (reasonably estimated by such Bank)
for each day during each Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans equal to the
product of the following:

               (i) the principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan to which such
         Interest Period relates; multiplied by

               (ii) the difference between (A) a fraction, the numerator of
         which is the LIBO Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such
         Eurodollar Loan and the denominator of which is one (1) minus such
         Bank's Actual Reserve Cost (defined below) (expressed as a decimal) and
         (B) the LIBO Rate; multiplied by

               (iii) 1/360.

         For the purposes of this Section 10.3(b), the "Bank's Actual Reserve
Cost" (which shall be reasonably estimated by the relevant Bank) shall be equal
to the cost actually incurred by such Bank from time to time during such
Interest Period as a result of the requirement that such Bank maintain Reserves
with respect to such Eurodollar Loan.

               (c) Each Bank shall take reasonable steps, including without
limitation, the designation of a different Eurodollar Lending Office (unless it
would otherwise be disadvantageous to the Bank in its reasonable judgment) if
such steps would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any payment that
otherwise would be due under Section 10.3(a) or 10.3(b). Any amounts payable by
the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower under Sections 10.3(a)
or 10.3(b) shall be remitted after the end of each Interest Period, within 30
days after submission by the Bank to the Company, the Affiliate or the Special
Purpose Borrower, as applicable (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a
written statement setting forth the amount thereof.

               (d) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, upon the
request of the Company, each Bank shall provide to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) its best estimate of such Bank's Actual Reserve Cost
incurred or to be incurred with respect to Eurodollar Loans in the principal
amounts specified in the Company's request.

         10.4 WITHHOLDING TAXES

               (a) Each Bank agrees to take reasonable measures, unless it would
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank in its reasonable judgment to avoid or
minimize withholding taxes in connection with any payments made to such Bank
hereunder, including without limitation designating another office of the Bank
as the lending office for a Loan.

               (b) If the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower
shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, then, subject
to Sections 10.4(e) and 10.4(f):


<PAGE>
                                                                              39


                  (i) the Company, Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower, as
         applicable, shall make such deductions;

                  (ii) the Company, Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower, shall
         pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority in
         accordance with applicable law, and shall provide to the Administrative
         Agent or such Bank upon its request any official receipts or other
         evidence of payment thereof that the Company, Affiliate or Special
         Purpose Borrower, as applicable, may obtain or have in its possession;
         and

                  (iii) if (A) the Administrative Agent or such Bank notifies
         the Company or Special Purpose Borrower (pursuant to Section 2.6 or
         2.12) at the time that the Company (on behalf of itself or an
         Affiliate) or the Special Purpose Borrower gives a notice of Borrowing
         or a notice to extend or convert any Loan that such Bank will require a
         Gross-up for withholding taxes in connection with such Loan, as so
         extended or converted, if applicable, or (B) no such notice was given
         by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, but after a notice of
         Borrowing, extension or conversion pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.12 in
         respect of such Loan was given a change in applicable law or
         regulation, or a change in the interpretation or administration thereof
         by any governmental or comparable authority, occurs that requires the
         Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower to so deduct or
         withhold taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to the
         Administrative Agent or such Bank, then the sum payable to the
         Administrative Agent or such Bank after the Company, the Affiliate or
         the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, makes all required
         deductions shall be increased by an amount such that the Administrative
         Agent or such Bank receives a total amount equal to the sum it would
         have received had no such deductions been made. If neither the
         Administrative Agent nor the affected Bank notifies the Company or
         Special Purpose Borrower at or prior to the time that the Company or
         Special Purpose Borrower gives a notice of Borrowing or a notice to
         extend or convert a Loan, as applicable, that the Administrative Agent
         or such Bank will require a Gross-up in connection with such Loan, as
         so extended or converted, if applicable, no Gross-up in respect of such
         Loan will be paid to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, except to
         the extent that a subsequent change in applicable law or regulation, or
         a change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
         governmental or comparable authority, requires the Company, the
         Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower to deduct or withhold taxes
         (or an increased amount thereof) from or in respect of any sum payable
         to the Administrative Agent or such Bank in respect of such Loan.

                  (c) If a Bank or the Bank's lending office is a foreign person
(i.e., a person organized or incorporated under the laws of a country other than
that under which the Company, the Affiliates or the Special Purpose Borrower is
incorporated), such Bank agrees that:

                  (i) it shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent and
         the Company, each Affiliate and the Special Purpose Borrower such
         accurate and complete signed forms or documentation as may be required
         from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation as
         a condition to exemption or other relief from or reduction of tax for
         withholding purposes; and

<PAGE>
                                                                              40


                  (ii) it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any
         event (including the passing of time) requiring a change in or renewal
         of the most recent forms or documentation previously delivered by such
         Bank, deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company, each
         Affiliate and the Special Purpose Borrower accurate and complete signed
         copies of such forms or documentation.

                  (d) To the extent that, as determined in good faith by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank in its sole discretion and without any
obligation to disclose its tax records, taxes withheld and paid in accordance
with this Section 10.4 for which a Gross-up has been paid have been irrevocably
utilized by the Administrative Agent or such Bank (either as credits or
deductions) to reduce its tax liabilities and such utilization is consistent
with its overall tax policies, the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall pay
to the Company, the Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, an
amount equal to such reduction obtained to the extent of such Gross-up paid by
the Company, Affiliate or Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, to the
Administrative Agent or such Bank as aforesaid.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, any Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower will be required to
pay any Gross-up in respect of taxes described below:

                  (i) if the obligation to pay such Gross-up would not have
         arisen but for a failure by a Bank to comply with its obligations under
         Section 10.4(c) in respect of the applicable lending office; or

                  (ii) if a Bank shall have delivered to the Company, the
         Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower, as applicable, any form or
         documentation required by Section 10.4(c) pursuant to which the Bank
         claims exemption from withholding tax by any jurisdiction or under any
         treaty of such jurisdiction, and the Bank shall not at any time be
         entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of taxes by such
         jurisdiction in respect of payment by the Company, Affiliate or Special
         Purpose Borrower, as applicable, hereunder for the account of such
         lending office for any reason other than a change in such
         jurisdiction's law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or
         regulations or in the official interpretation of any such law, treaty
         or regulations by any Governmental Authority charged with the
         interpretation or administration thereof after the date of delivery of
         such form or documentation.

                  (f) In the event any Bank sells or grants a participation in
its rights under this Agreement or any Loan hereunder, such Bank agrees to
undertake sole responsibility for complying with any withholding tax
requirements relating to the purchaser thereof imposed by any jurisdiction,
including, without limitation, those imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

         10.5 REPLACEMENT OF BANKS.

                  The Company or Special Purpose Borrower shall be permitted to
replace any Bank that (a) requests reimbursement from it for amounts owing
pursuant to Section 10.3 or


<PAGE>
                                                                              41


10.4(b) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans to it hereunder, with a
replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not
conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default, Affiliate Event
of Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy shall have occurred and be continuing
at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Bank
shall have taken no action under Section 10.3(e) or 10.4(a) so as to eliminate
the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 10.3 or
10.4(b), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all
Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Bank on or prior to the date of
replacement, (v) the Company or Special Purpose Borrower shall be liable to such
replaced Bank under Section 2.18 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced
Bank shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period
relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a
Bank, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the
replaced Bank shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.1 (provided that the Company or Special Purpose
Borrower, as applicable, shall be obligated to pay the registration and
processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement
shall be consummated, the Company or Special Purpose Borrower shall pay all
additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 10.3 or 10.4(b), as the
case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
any rights that the Company, the Special Purpose Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any other Bank shall have against the replaced Bank.

SECTION 11. THE AGENTS

         11.1 APPOINTMENT

         Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative
Agent as the agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

         11.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care in
consultation with the Company.

<PAGE>
                                                                              42

         11.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS

         Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except to the extent that any of the foregoing
are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Company, any
Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower or any officer thereof contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection
with, this Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or for any failure of the
Company to perform its obligations hereunder. The Agents shall not be under any
obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Company, any
Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower.

         11.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement,
order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company, any
Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks (or, if
so specified by this Agreement, all Banks) as it deems appropriate or it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
in accordance with a request of the Required Banks (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Banks), and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of
the Loans.

         11.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default, Affiliate Event of
Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy unless the Administrative Agent has
received notice from a Bank, the Company, an Affiliate or the Special Purpose
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such default or Event of
Default, Affiliate Event of Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy and stating
that such


<PAGE>
                                                                              43

notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to
the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such
default or Event of Default, Affiliate Event of Default or Event of
Default-Bankruptcy as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks (or, if
so specified by this Agreement, all Banks); provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such default or Event of Default, Affiliate
Event of Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of the Banks.

         11.6 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER BANKS

         Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company,
any Affiliate or the Special Purpose Borrower shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the
Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Company and its Affiliates or
the Special Purpose Borrower that may come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         11.7 INDEMNIFICATION

         The Banks agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Company, the Affiliates or the Special Purpose
Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Company, the Affiliates and
the Special Purpose Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective
Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is
sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon
which the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such
Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that
may at any time (whether before or after the payment

<PAGE>
                                                                              44


of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, this Agreement,
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         11.8 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY

         Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or an Affiliate as
though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to Loans made or renewed by
it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms
"Bank" and "Banks" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

         11.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 45
days' notice to the Banks and the Company. If the Administrative Agent shall
resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Banks
shall appoint from among the Banks a successor administrative agent for the
Banks, which successor administrative agent shall (unless an Event of Default
under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.3 with respect to the Company shall have
occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor administrative agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and
the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or
any holders of the Loans. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 45 days following a
retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective, and the Banks shall assume and perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Banks
appoint a successor administrative agent as provided for above. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Section 11 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

         11.10 SYNDICATION AGENT

         The Syndication Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities
hereunder in its capacity as such.

<PAGE>
                                                                              45

Special Purpose Borrower with respect to any payment required to be made by it
under this Agreement shall survive the term of this Agreement.

         12.3 NO WAIVERS

         No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
to the Administrative Agent, with statements with respect to the foregoing to be

              (b) The Company, with respect to an Event of Default and Event of
Default - Bankruptcy and Loans to it, or an Affiliate or the Special Purpose

         any modification of this Agreement or any Accession Memoranda or any
         waiver or consent under or in respect of this Agreement or any
         Accession Memoranda, and will save the Administrative Agent and the
         Banks harmless against any loss or liability (including interest and
         penalties) resulting from nonpayment or delay in payment of any such
         taxes.

              (c) The Company, the Affiliate and the Special Purpose Borrower

affiliates, agents and controlling persons (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from
and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance and administration of this Agreement, including any of the foregoing
relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of, noncompliance

reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel in connection with claims, actions
or proceedings by any Indemnitee against the Company, any Affiliate or the

the Special Purpose Borrower shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such

willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, and to
the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Company, each Affiliate and
the Special Purpose Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries
not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive

Agent, it being agreed by the Company that in no event shall the Company enter
into an agreement with the Special Purpose Borrower which subjects the Company's
approval to an amendment of any part of this Agreement to the consent of the
Special Purpose Borrower; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such
amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or
extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, reduce the stated rate
of any interest or fee payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any
payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the termination date of any
Bank's Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Bank
directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any
Bank under this Section 12.8 without the written consent of such Bank; (iii)
reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Banks, consent to
the assignment or transfer by the Company of any of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (other than in accordance with and to the extent permitted
by Section 9.3), or release the Company from its guarantee obligations under
Section 4 in each case without the written consent of all Banks; (iv) amend,
modify or waive any provision of Section 11 without the written consent of each
Agent or (v) amend or modify the interest rate, maturity, amortization or
principal amount outstanding on any Loan made or assigned to the Special Purpose
Borrower without the Special Purpose Borrower's consent. Any such waiver and any
such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the
Banks and shall be binding upon the Company, the Affiliates, the Special Purpose
Borrower, the Banks, the Agents and all future holders of the Loans. In the case
of any waiver, the Company, the Affiliates, the Special Purpose Borrower, the
Banks and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position
and rights hereunder, and any default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed
to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon.

              (b) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides
for payments to be allocated to a particular Bank, if any Bank (a "Benefitted
Bank") shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it
in a greater proportion than any such payment to any other Bank, if any, in
respect of the Obligations owing to such other Bank, such Benefitted Bank shall
purchase for cash from the other Banks a participating interest in such portion
of the Obligations owing to each such other Bank as shall be necessary to cause
such Benefitted Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of the Banks;
provided, however, that if all or any

portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted
Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price returned, to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.
