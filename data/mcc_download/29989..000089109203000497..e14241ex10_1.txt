Lender's  ratable  portion of such  Borrowing,  the Agent may  assume  that such
Lender  has  made  such  portion  available  to the  Agent  on the  date of such
Borrowing in accordance  with  subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower
on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have so made such ratable  portion  available to the Agent,  such Lender and
such  Borrower  severally  agree to repay to the Agent  forthwith on demand such
corresponding  amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made  available  to such  Borrower  until the date such amount is
repaid to the  Agent,  at (i) in the case of a  Borrower,  the higher of (A) the

denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect

such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding  amount,  such amount so
repaid shall  constitute  such  Lender's  Advance as part of such  Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

      (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part
of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its  obligation,  if any,
hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall
be  responsible  for the  failure of any other  Lender to make the Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

      Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

            (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance
      is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during
      each Interest  Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the  Eurocurrency
      Rate for such  Interest  Period for such Advance  plus (y) the  Applicable
      Margin in effect  from  time to time plus (z) the  Applicable  Utilization
      Fee, if any,  in effect from time to time,  payable in arrears on the last
      day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of
      more than three  months,  on each day that  occurs  during  such  Interest
      Period every three months from the first day of such  Interest  Period and
      on the date such  Eurocurrency  Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in
      full.

      (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default under Section  6.01(a),  the Agent may, and upon the request of
the Required  Lenders  shall,  require the  Borrowers to pay interest  ("Default
Interest")  on (i) the unpaid  principal  amount of each  Advance  owing to each
Lender,  payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per
annum  required to be paid on such Advance  pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above  and (ii) to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by law,  the  amount  of any
interest,  fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from
the date such  amount  shall be due  until  such  amount  shall be paid in full,
payable in arrears on the date such amount  shall be paid in full and on demand,
at a rate per annum  equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum
required  to be paid on Base Rate  Advances  pursuant  to clause  (a)(i)  above;
provided,  however,  that  following  acceleration  of the Advances  pursuant to
Section 6.01,  Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or
not previously required by the Agent.

      SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination.  (a) Each Reference Bank agrees
to furnish to the Agent timely  information for the purpose of determining  each
Eurocurrency  Rate. If any one or more of the Reference  Banks shall not furnish
such timely  information  to the Agent for the purpose of  determining  any such
interest  rate,  the Agent shall  determine  such  interest rate on the basis of
timely information  furnished by the remaining  Reference Banks. The Agent shall
give prompt notice to the applicable  Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable
interest  rate  determined  by the Agent for purposes of Section  2.06(a)(i)  or
(ii), and the rate, if any,  furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii).

      (b) If, with  respect to any  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances,  the  Required
Lenders notify the Agent that (i) they are unable to obtain matching deposits in
the London  inter-bank market at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the second
Business  Day before the making of a  Borrowing  in  sufficient  amounts to fund
their respective Advances as a part of such Borrowing during its Interest Period
or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not
adequately  reflect  the cost to such  Required  Lenders of  making,  funding or
maintaining  their  respective  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances  for such  Interest
Period,  the Agent shall  forthwith  so notify the  applicable  Borrower and the
Lenders,  whereupon (A) such Borrower will, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, (1) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated
in Dollars,  either (x) prepay such  Advances or (y) Convert such  Advances into
Base Rate Advances and (2) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in
any  Committed  Currency,  either (x) prepay such  Advances or (y) exchange such
Advances  into an  Equivalent  amount of Dollars and Convert such  Advances into
Base Rate Advances and (B) the  obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
Advances  into,  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances in the affected  currency  shall be
suspended  until the Agent shall notify the  Borrowers  and the Lenders that the
circumstances  causing such  suspension no longer exist;  provided  that, if the
circumstances  set forth in clause  (ii) above are  applicable,  the  applicable
Borrower  may elect,  by notice to the Agent and the Lenders,  to continue  such
Advances in such Committed  Currency for Interest Periods of not longer than one
month,  which Advances shall  thereafter bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Applicable Margin plus the Applicable  Utilization Fee, if any, plus, for
each Lender,  the cost to such Lender (expressed as a rate per annum) of funding
its Eurocurrency Rate Advances by whatever means it reasonably  determines to be
appropriate.  Each  Lender  shall  certify  its cost of funds for each  Interest
Period to the Agent and the applicable  Borrower as soon as practicable  (but in
any event not later than ten Business  Days after the first day of such Interest
Period).

      (c) If any  Borrower  shall fail to select the  duration  of any  Interest
Period  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  contained  in the  definition  of
"Interest Period" in Section 1.01 for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances


                                       13
<PAGE>

made to it, the Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Lenders and
such Advances will automatically,  on the last day of the then existing Interest
Period  therefor,  (i) if such  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances are  denominated  in
Dollars,  Convert  into Base Rate  Advances and (ii) if such  Eurocurrency  Rate
Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent
amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate Advances.

      (d) On the  date  on  which  the  aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount  of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment
or prepayment or otherwise,  to less than the Borrowing  Minimum,  such Advances
shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

      (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
under Section 6.01(a), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on
the  last  day of the  then  existing  Interest  Period  therefor,  (A) if  such
Eurocurrency  Rate Advances are  denominated in Dollars,  be Converted into Base
Rate Advances and (B) if such  Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any
Committed  Currency,  be exchanged  for an  Equivalent  amount of Dollars and be
Converted  into Base Rate  Advances  and (ii) the  obligation  of the Lenders to
make,  or  to  Convert  Advances  into,  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances  shall  be
suspended;  provided that the  applicable  Borrower may elect,  by notice to the
Agent and the  Lenders  within one  Business  Day of such Event of  Default,  to
continue  such  Advances in such  Committed  Currency,  whereupon  the Agent may
require that each Interest  Period relating to such  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances
shall bear  interest at the  Overnight  Eurocurrency  Rate for a period of three
Business Days and thereafter, each such Interest Period shall have a duration of
not longer  than one month.  "Overnight  Eurocurrency  Rate"  means the rate per
annum applicable to an overnight period beginning on one Business Day and ending
on the next  Business Day equal to the sum of 1%, the  Applicable  Interest Rate
Margin and the average,  rounded upward to the nearest whole multiple of 1/16 of
1%, if such average is not such a multiple,  of the  respective  rates per annum
quoted by each Reference Bank to the Agent on request as the rate at which it is
offering  overnight  deposits in the relevant currency in amounts  comparable to
such Reference Bank's Eurocurrency Rate Advances.

      (f) If  Telerate  Markets  Page 3750 is  unavailable  and  fewer  than two
Reference  Banks furnish  timely  information to the Agent for  determining  the
Eurocurrency Rate for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances,

            (i) the Agent shall  forthwith  notify the Borrowers and the Lenders
      that the interest rate cannot be  determined  for such  Eurocurrency  Rate
      Advances,

            (ii) with respect to Eurocurrency  Rate Advances,  each such Advance
      will  automatically,  on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
      therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars,
      Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance
      is  denominated  in any Committed  Currency,  be prepaid by the applicable
      Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars
      and be  Converted  into a Base Rate  Advance (or if such Advance is then a
      Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

            (iii)  the  obligation  of the  Lenders  to make  Eurocurrency  Rate
      Advances or to Convert Advances into  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances shall be
      suspended  until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that
      the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

      SECTION 2.08.  Optional  Conversion of Advances.  Each Borrower may on any
Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City  time)  on the  third  Business  Day  prior  to the  date  of the  proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.11,  Convert all
Advances made to such Borrower denominated in Dollars of one Type comprising the
same Borrowing into Advances denominated in Dollars of the other Type; provided,
however,  that any  Conversion  of  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances  into Base Rate
Advances  shall  be made  only on the last day of an  Interest  Period  for such
Eurocurrency   Rate  Advances,   any  Conversion  of  Base  Rate  Advances  into
Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances  shall be in an amount  not less  than the  minimum
amount  specified in Section  2.02(b) and no  Conversion  of any Advances  shall
result in more separate  Borrowings than permitted under Section  2.02(b).  Each
such notice of a Conversion  shall,  within the  restrictions  specified  above,
specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Dollar denominated Advances to
be Converted,  and (iii) if such Conversion is into  Eurocurrency Rate Advances,
the duration of the initial  Interest


                                       14
<PAGE>

Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and
binding on the applicable Borrower.

      SECTION 2.09.  Prepayments of Advances.  (a) Optional.  Each Borrower may,
upon notice at least two Business Days' prior to the date of such prepayment, in
the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances,  and not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the date of such prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to
the Agent  stating  the  proposed  date and  aggregate  principal  amount of the
prepayment,  and if such notice is given the Borrower  giving such notice shall,
prepay the outstanding  principal amount of the Advances  comprising part of the
same  Borrowing in whole or ratably in part,  together with accrued  interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided,  however,
that (x) each partial  prepayment  shall be in an aggregate  principal amount of
not less than the  Borrowing  Minimum or an integral  multiple of the  Borrowing
Multiple  in excess  thereof  and (y) in the event of any such  prepayment  of a
Eurocurrency  Rate Advance,  such  Borrower  shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c).

      (b) Mandatory. (i) If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Borrowers that,
on any interest  payment date, the sum of (A) the aggregate  principal amount of
all Advances  denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in
Dollars  (determined  on the third  Business Day prior to such interest  payment
date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed
Currencies  then  outstanding  exceeds 103% of the aggregate  Commitments of the
Lenders on such date, the Borrowers  shall,  as soon as  practicable  and in any
event within two  Business  Days after  receipt of such  notice,  subject to the
proviso to this  sentence  set forth  below,  prepay the  outstanding  principal
amount of any Advances owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount  sufficient
to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate  Commitments
of the Lenders on such date  together  with any interest  accrued to the date of
such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount of Advances prepaid;  provided
that if the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances  outstanding at the
time of such  required  prepayment  is less  than the  amount  of such  required
prepayment,  the portion of such required  prepayment in excess of the aggregate
principal amount of Base Rate Advances then outstanding  shall be deferred until
the next succeeding  last day of an Interest Period of outstanding  Eurocurrency
Rate  Advances  in an  aggregate  amount  equal to the  excess of such  required
prepayment.  The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under
this Section 2.09(b) to the Borrowers and the Lenders,  and shall provide prompt
notice to the Borrowers of any such notice of required prepayment received by it
from any Lender.

      (ii) Each  prepayment  made pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) shall be made
together  with  any  interest  accrued  to the  date of such  prepayment  on the
principal  amounts  prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency
Rate  Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest  Period or at its
maturity,  any  additional  amounts  which  the  applicable  Borrower  shall  be
obligated  to reimburse  to the Lenders in respect  thereof  pursuant to Section
9.04(b).  The Agent shall give prompt notice of any  prepayment  required  under
this Section 2.09(b) to the Borrowers and the Lenders.

      SECTION 2.10.  Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction
of or any change in or in the  interpretation of any law or regulation after the
date hereof,  or (ii) the compliance  with any guideline or request issued after
the date hereof from any central bank or other governmental authority including,
without  limitation,  any agency of the  European  Union or similar  monetary or
multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining  Eurocurrency Rate Advances  (excluding for purposes of this Section
2.10 any such  increased  costs  resulting  from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which  Section  2.13 shall  govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall  net  income or  overall  gross  income by the  United  States or by the
foreign  jurisdiction  or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized
or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then
the Borrowers  shall from time to time,  upon demand by such Lender (with a copy
of such  demand to the  Agent),  pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost;
provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different  Applicable  Lending Office if the making
of such a  designation  would  avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
increased  cost and would not, in the  reasonable  judgment of such  Lender,  be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost,  submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Lender,  shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


                                       15
<PAGE>

      (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or
any guideline or request  taking effect or issued after the date hereof from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law)  affects or would  affect the amount of capital  required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender or any  corporation  controlling  such Lender and that
the amount of such capital is  increased by or based upon the  existence of such
Lender's  commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then,
upon  demand  by such  Lender  (with a copy of such  demand to the  Agent),  the
Borrowers  shall pay to the Agent for the account of such  Lender,  from time to
time as specified by such Lender,  additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate
such  Lender  or such  corporation  in the light of such  circumstances,  to the
extent that such Lender  reasonably  determines  such  increase in capital to be
allocable to the existence of such  Lender's  commitment  to lend  hereunder.  A
certificate as to such amounts  submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      (c)  Failure  or delay on the part of any  Lender to  demand  compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such  compensation;  provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to
compensate  a  Lender  pursuant  to this  Section  for any  increased  costs  or
reductions  incurred  more than six  months  prior to the date that such  Lender
notifies the Borrowers of the circumstances  giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions  and of such Lender's  intention to claim  compensation  therefor;
provided further that, if the circumstances  giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions  cause such increased costs or reductions to be retroactive,  then
the six-month  period  referred to above shall be extended to include the period
of retroactive effect thereof.

      SECTION  2.11.  Illegality.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this
Agreement,  if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any
change in or in the  interpretation  of any law or regulation makes it unlawful,
or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its  Eurocurrency  Lending  Office to perform its  obligations
hereunder  to make  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances  in  Dollars  or any  Committed
Currency or to fund or  maintain  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances in Dollars or any
Committed  Currency  hereunder,  (a) (i) if such  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advance is
denominated  in Dollars,  be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such
Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be exchanged
into an Equivalent  amount of Dollars and be Converted  into a Base Rate Advance
and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make  Eurocurrency Rate Advances in the
affected  currency or to Convert Advances into  Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall
be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist;  provided,  however, that
before  making any such demand,  each Lender  agrees to use  reasonable  efforts
(consistent  with its internal policy and legal and regulatory  restrictions) to
designate  a  different  Eurocurrency  Lending  Office  if the  making of such a
designation  would  allow  such  Lender or its  Eurocurrency  Lending  Office to
continue to perform its obligations to make such  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances or
to continue to fund or maintain such  Eurocurrency  Rate Advances and would not,
in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

      SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrowers shall make each
payment  hereunder  (except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other
amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency), irrespective
of any right of  counterclaim  or set-off,  not later than 11:00 A.M.  (New York
City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent's
Account in same day funds. The Borrowers shall make each payment  hereunder with
respect to principal of,  interest on, and other amounts  relating to,  Advances
denominated in a Committed  Currency,  irrespective of any right of counterclaim
or set-off,  not later than 11:00 A.M. (at the Payment Office for such Committed
Currency)  on the day when  due in such  Committed  Currency  to the  Agent,  by
deposit of such funds to the applicable  Agent's Account in same day funds.  The
Agent will promptly  thereafter  cause to be distributed  like funds relating to
the  payment of  principal  or interest or  facility  fees  ratably  (other than
amounts  payable  pursuant to Section 2.10,  2.13 or 9.04(c)) to the Lenders for
the  account of their  respective  Applicable  Lending  Offices,  and like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender
for the account of its Applicable  Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a
Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment  Increase pursuant to Section 2.17,
and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording
of the  information  contained  therein  in the  Register,  from and  after  the
applicable  Increase Date, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under
any Notes issued in  connection  therewith  in respect of the  interest  assumed
thereby  to the  Assuming  Lender.  Upon its  acceptance  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance and recording of the  information  contained  therein in the Register
pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the


                                       16
<PAGE>

effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make
all payments  hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest  assigned
thereby to the Lender  assignee  thereunder,  and the parties to such Assignment
and  Acceptance  shall make all  appropriate  adjustments  in such  payments for
periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

      (b) Each  Borrower  hereby  authorizes  each Lender,  if and to the extent
payment  owed to such  Lender is not made when due  hereunder  or under the Note
held by such  Lender,  to charge  from time to time  against  any or all of such
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

      (c) All  computations  of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by
the  Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366  days,  as the case may be,  all
computations  of interest  based on the  Eurocurrency  Rate or the Federal Funds
Rate and of fees  shall be made by the  Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days
(or, in each case of Advances  denominated in Committed  Currencies where market
practice  differs,  in accordance  with market  practice),  in each case for the
actual  number of days  (including  the first  day but  excluding  the last day)
occurring  in the period  for which  such  interest  or fees are  payable.  Each
determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      (d) Whenever  any payment  hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to
be due on a day other than a Business  Day,  such  payment  shall be made on the
next  succeeding  Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the  computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case
may be;  provided,  however,  that,  if such  extension  would cause  payment of
interest on or principal of  Eurocurrency  Rate  Advances to be made in the next
following  calendar  month,  such  payment  shall be made on the next  preceding
Business Day.

      (e)  Unless the Agent  shall  have  received  notice  from the  applicable
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders  hereunder
that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that
such  Borrower  has made such  payment in full to the Agent on such date and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such  assumption,  cause to be  distributed  to each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such  Lender.  If
and to the extent the applicable Borrower shall not have so made such payment in
full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
amount  distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon,  for each day
from the date such  amount is  distributed  to such  Lender  until the date such
Lender  repays  such amount to the Agent,  at (i) the Federal  Funds Rate in the
case of Advances  denominated  in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds  incurred by
the Agent in  respect  of such  amount in the case of  Advances  denominated  in
Committed Currencies.

      (f) To the extent that the Agent  receives  funds for  application  to the
amounts owing by any Borrower  under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note
in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent
to distribute  funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section
2.12, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars
or into a Committed  Currency,  to the extent  necessary  to enable the Agent to
distribute  such  funds in  accordance  with the  terms  of this  Section  2.12;
provided that each Borrower and each of the Lenders  hereby agree that the Agent
shall not be liable or  responsible  for any loss,  cost or expense  suffered by
such  Borrower  or such  Lender as a result of any  conversion  or  exchange  of
currencies  affected  pursuant  to this  Section  2.12(f)  or as a result of the
failure of the Agent to effect any such  conversion  or  exchange;  and provided
further that the  Borrowers  agree to indemnify  the Agent and each Lender,  and
hold the Agent  and each  Lender  harmless,  for any and all  losses,  costs and
expenses  incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any  conversion or exchange of
currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any  currencies) in accordance
with this Section 2.12(f).

      SECTION 2.13.  Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party to or for
the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the Notes or any other
documents to be delivered  hereunder  shall be made, in accordance  with Section
2.12 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and
without  deduction  for any and all present or future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,
deductions,  charges or withholdings,  and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding,  in the case of each  Lender  and the  Agent,  taxes  imposed  on its
overall  net income,  and  franchise  taxes  imposed on it in lieu of net income
taxes, by the jurisdiction  under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) is organized or any political  subdivision  thereof and, in the
case of each  Lender,  taxes  imposed on its overall net income,  and  franchise
taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income  taxes,


                                       17
<PAGE>

by the jurisdiction of such Lender's  Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof and excluding such taxes imposed by the United States or the
United Kingdom that are payable as of the date such Lender or the Agent became a
party  to  this  Agreement  (all  such  non-excluded  taxes,  levies,   imposts,
deductions,  charges,  withholdings  and  liabilities  in  respect  of  payments
hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter  referred to as "Taxes").  If any
Loan Party  shall be  required  by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum  payable  hereunder  or under  any  Note or any  other  documents  to be
delivered  hereunder  to any Lender or the Agent,  (i) the sum payable  shall be
increased  as may be  necessary  so that after  making all  required  deductions
(including  deductions  applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.13) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)  receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such  deductions been made, (ii) such Loan
Party  shall make such  deductions  and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full
amount  deducted  to the  relevant  taxation  authority  or other  authority  in
accordance with applicable law.

      (b) In addition,  the  Borrowers  shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary  taxes or any other  excise or  property  taxes,  charges or similar
levies  that arise from any  payment  made  hereunder  or under the Notes or any
other  documents to be delivered  hereunder or from the  execution,  delivery or
registration of,  performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
or the Notes or any  other  documents  to be  delivered  hereunder  (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

      (c) The Borrowers  shall  indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold
it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,  without
limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable  under this Section 2.13) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent
(as the  case  may be) and any  liability  (including  penalties,  interest  and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall
be made  within 30 days from the date such  Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) makes written demand therefor.

      (d) Within 45 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,  the applicable
Loan Party shall  furnish to the Agent,  at its  address  referred to in Section
9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt  evidencing  such payment to
the extent such a receipt is issued therefor,  or other written proof of payment
thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. In the case of any payment
hereunder or under the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by
or on behalf of any Loan  Party  (other  than OFP)  through an account or branch
outside the United  States or by or on behalf of any Loan Party (other than OFP)
by a payor that is not a United  States  person,  if such Loan Party  determines
that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,  such Loan Party shall furnish, or
shall cause such payor to furnish,  to the Agent, at such address, an opinion of
counsel  acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.
For  purposes of this  subsection  (d) and  subsection  (e),  the terms  "United
States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings  specified in Section
7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (e) Each Lender  organized  under the laws of a  jurisdiction  outside the
United  States,  on or prior to the date of its  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial  Lender and on the date of the  Assumption
Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender
in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably
requested  in  writing by OFI and OCI (but only so long as such  Lender  remains
lawfully  able to do so),  shall  provide each of the Agent OFI and OCI with two
original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any
successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue  Service,  certifying
that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced  rate of United  States
withholding  tax on payments  made by OFI and OCI pursuant to this  Agreement or
the  Notes.  If the form  provided  by a Lender  at the time such  Lender  first
becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding
tax rate in excess of zero,  withholding  tax at such rate  shall be  considered
excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate  forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies,  whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered  excluded from Taxes for periods  governed by such
form; provided,  however,  that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant  to which a Lender  assignee  becomes  a party to this  Agreement,  the
Lender  assignor was  entitled to payments  under  subsection  (a) in respect of
United States  withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent,  the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding  taxes
that may be imposed  in the  future or other  amounts  otherwise  includable  in
Taxes) United States  withholding  tax, if any,  applicable  with respect to the
Lender  assignee  on such  date.  If any form or  document  referred  to in this
subsection (e) requires the disclosure of  information,  other than  information
necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof
by Internal  Revenue Service


                                       18
<PAGE>

form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably  considers to be confidential,
the Lender  shall give notice  thereof to OFI and OCI and shall not be obligated
to include in such form or document such confidential information.

      (f) For any  period  with  respect to which a Lender has failed to provide
OFI and OCI with the appropriate form,  certificate or other document  described
in Section  2.13(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in
the interpretation or application  thereof,  occurring subsequent to the date on
which a form,  certificate  or other  document  originally  was  required  to be
provided,  or if such  form,  certificate  or other  document  otherwise  is not
required  under  subsection  (e) above),  such  Lender  shall not be entitled to
indemnification  under  Section  2.13(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by
the United States by reason of such failure;  provided,  however,  that should a
Lender  become  subject  to Taxes  because  of its  failure  to  deliver a form,
certificate or other document required hereunder,  the Borrowers shall take such
steps as the  Lender  shall  reasonably  request to assist the Lender to recover
such Taxes.

      (g) In  respect  of  Advances  to OFP,  each  Lender  shall  designate  an
Applicable  Lending Office that is beneficially  entitled to interest under such
Advances and that,  on the date of this  Agreement or (in the case of any Person
that  becomes a Lender  hereunder  by means of an  assignment)  on the date such
Lender  becomes a party hereto is either (i) within the charge to United Kingdom
corporation tax in respect of interest in respect of an advance by a person that
was a bank (for the  purposes  of Section 349 Income and  Corporation  Taxes Act
1988) at the time the advance was made; or (ii) resident in a country with which
the United Kingdom has a double  taxation  agreement  which makes  provision for
full exemption from United Kingdom  taxation on interest payable by OFP pursuant
to this Agreement and does not carry on business in the United Kingdom through a
permanent  establishment  with which the payment is effectively  connected (each
such bank which is so resident  being  hereinafter in this Section 2.13 referred
to as a "Treaty Lender");  or (iii) a company resident in the United Kingdom, or
a partnership  each member of which is a company  resident in the United Kingdom
for United Kingdom tax purposes; or (iv) a company not so resident in the United
Kingdom  which  carries  on a trade in the  United  Kingdom  through a branch or
agency and which is required to bring into account interest payable to it by OFP
pursuant to this Agreement in computing its chargeable  profits for the purposes
of Section  11(2) of the Income and  Corporation  Taxes Act 1988.  If any Lender
does not or ceases to comply with clause  (i),  (ii),  (iii) or (iv) above other
than by reason of any  change  after  the date of this  Agreement  in (or in the
interpretation,  administration  or application  of) any law or double  taxation
agreement  or any  published  practice  or  concession  of any  relevant  taxing
authority,  the Borrowers  shall not be required to compensate such Lender under
Section 2.13(a) or 2.13(c) for the amount of Taxes imposed by the United Kingdom
in consequence. Any Lender to whom clause (ii) above is relevant shall cooperate
with OFP in promptly completing any procedural  formalities necessary for OFP to
obtain  authorization to make interest  payments without deduction for UK income
tax.

      (h) Each Treaty Lender irrevocably  appoints the Agent to act as syndicate
manager  under,  and  authorizes  the  Agent to  operate,  and  take any  action
necessary or desirable  under,  the PTR Scheme in connection  with any Borrowing
hereunder.  Each Treaty Lender shall  cooperate with the Agent in completing any
procedural formalities necessary under the PTR Scheme, and shall promptly supply
to the Agent such  information  as the Agent may request in connection  with the
operation of the PTR Scheme.  Each Treaty Lender without  limiting the liability
of any  Borrower  under this  Agreement,  shall,  within five  Business  Days of
demand, indemnify the Agent for any liability or loss incurred by the Agent as a
result  of the  Agent  acting  as  syndicate  manager  under  the PTR  Scheme in
connection with the Treaty Lender's  participation  in any Borrowing  (except to
the extent that the  liability or loss arises  directly  from the Agent's  gross
negligence  or willful  misconduct).  Each  Treaty  Lender  shall,  within  five
Business Days of demand, indemnify each Borrower for any Tax which such Borrower
becomes  liable to pay in respect of any  payments  made to such  Treaty  Lender
arising as a result of any incorrect  information supplied by such Treaty Lender
which results in a provisional  authority  issued by the UK Inland Revenue under
the PTR Scheme being  withdrawn.  Each  Borrower  acknowledges  that it is fully
aware of its contingent  obligations under the PTR Scheme and shall (i) promptly
inform the Agent of all actions  required to be performed by the Agent under the
PTR Scheme,  (ii) promptly supply to the Agent such information as the Agent may
request in  connection  with the  operation of the PTR Scheme;  and (iii) act in
accordance with any provisional notice issued by the UK Inland Revenue under the
PTR Scheme. The Agent agrees to provide,  as soon as reasonably  practicable,  a
copy  of any  provisional  authority  issued  to it  under  the  PTR  Scheme  in
connection with any Borrowing to those Borrowers  specified in such  provisional
authority.  Each of the Borrowers, the Treaty Lenders and the Agent acknowledges
that the Agent: (i) is entitled to rely completely upon information  provided to
it in connection with this clause;  (ii) is not


                                       19
<PAGE>

obliged to undertake any inquiry into the accuracy of such  information nor into
the status of the Treaty Lender or, as the case may be, Borrower  providing such
information; and (iii) shall have no liability to any person for the accuracy of
any  information  it submits to the UK Inland  Revenue in  connection  with this
clause.

      (i) Any Lender claiming any additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to this
Section  2.13 agrees to use  reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory  restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Eurocurrency  Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, any such  additional  amounts that may  thereafter
accrue and would not, in the  reasonable  judgment of such Lender,  be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

      SECTION  2.14.  Sharing of  Payments,  Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether  voluntary,  involuntary,  through the exercise of any right of
set-off,  or  otherwise)  on account  of the  Advances  owing to it (other  than
pursuant to Section  2.10,  2.13 or  9.04(c)) in excess of its ratable  share of
payments on account of the  Advances  obtained by all the  Lenders,  such Lender
shall  forthwith  purchase  from the other  Lenders such  participations  in the
Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing  Lender to
share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,  however,  that if
all or any  portion of such excess  payment is  thereafter  recovered  from such
purchasing  Lender,  such  purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing  Lender the purchase price to the extent of
such  recovery  together  with an amount equal to such  Lender's  ratable  share
(according  to the  proportion  of (i)  the  amount  of such  Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the  purchasing  Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total  amount so  recovered.  Each  Borrower  agrees  that any  Lender so
purchasing a  participation  from another  Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.14
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,  exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such  participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct  creditor of such  Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

      SECTION  2.15.  Evidence  of  Debt.  (a) Each  Lender  shall  maintain  in
accordance  with its usual  practice  an  account  or  accounts  evidencing  the
indebtedness  of each Borrower to such Lender  resulting from each Advance owing
to such  Lender  from time to time,  including  the  amounts  of  principal  and
interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect
of Advances made to such Borrower.  The Borrowers  agree that upon notice by any
Lender to the Borrowers  (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect
that a Note is  required  or  appropriate  in order for such  Lender to evidence
(whether for purposes of pledge,  enforcement  or otherwise)  the Advances owing
to, or to be made by, such Lender,  the  Borrowers  shall  promptly  execute and
deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal
amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.

      (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) shall
include a control account,  and a subsidiary  account for each Lender,  in which
accounts  (taken  together)  shall be  recorded  (i) the date and amount of each
Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if
appropriate,  the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  (ii) the terms of each
Assumption  Agreement  and  each  Assignment  and  Acceptance  delivered  to and
accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from each  Borrower to each Lender  hereunder and (iv)
the amount of any sum  received by the Agent from each  Borrower  hereunder  and
each Lender's share thereof.

      (c) Entries  made in good faith by the Agent in the  Register  pursuant to
subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts  pursuant to
subsection  (a) above,  shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal
and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to,
in the case of the  Register,  each Lender  and, in the case of such  account or
accounts,  such Lender, under this Agreement,  absent manifest error;  provided,
however,  that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry,  or any
finding that an entry is incorrect,  in the Register or such account or accounts
shall not limit or otherwise  affect the  obligations of any Borrower under this
Agreement.

      SECTION  2.16.  Use of Proceeds.  The  proceeds of the  Advances  shall be
available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds)  solely for
general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries.


                                       20

      SECTION  2.17.  Increase in the Aggregate  Commitments.  (a) The Guarantor
may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar  year prior
to the  Termination  Date,  by notice to the Agent,  request that the  aggregate
amount  of the  Commitments  be  increased  by an amount  of  $10,000,000  or an
integral multiple thereof (each a "Commitment Increase") to be effective as of a
date that is at least 90 days prior to the  scheduled  Termination  Date then in
effect (the  "Increase  Date") as specified in the related  notice to the Agent;
provided,  however  that (i) in no  event  shall  the  aggregate  amount  of the
Commitments  at any  time  exceed  $1,000,000,000  and  (ii) on the  date of any
request by the Guarantor for a Commitment  Increase and on the related  Increase
Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article III shall be satisfied.

      (b) The Agent  shall  promptly  notify  the  Lenders  of a request  by the
Guarantor for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed
amount of such requested  Commitment  Increase,  (ii) the proposed Increase Date
and (iii) the date by which Lenders  wishing to  participate  in the  Commitment
Increase  must  commit  to  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  their  respective
Commitments (the "Commitment  Date"). Each Lender that is willing to participate
in such requested  Commitment  Increase (each an "Increasing  Lender") shall, in
its  sole  discretion,  give  written  notice  to the  Agent  on or prior to the
Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment.
If the Lenders  notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of
their  respective  Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of
the requested  Commitment  Increase,  the requested Commitment Increase shall be
allocated  among the Lenders  willing to participate  therein in such amounts as
are agreed between the Guarantor and the Agent.

      (c) Promptly  following each  Commitment  Date, the Agent shall notify the
Guarantor  as to the  amount,  if any,  by which  the  Lenders  are  willing  to
participate in the requested  Commitment  Increase.  If the aggregate  amount by
which the  Lenders  are  willing  to  participate  in any  requested  Commitment
Increase  on any such  Commitment  Date is less  than the  requested  Commitment
Increase, then the Guarantor may extend offers to one or more Eligible Assignees
to participate in any portion of the requested  Commitment Increase that has not
been committed to by the Lenders as of the applicable Commitment Date; provided,
however,  that the  Commitment  of each such  Eligible  Assignee  shall be in an
amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

      (d) On each Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to
participate  in a requested  Commitment  Increase  in  accordance  with  Section
2.17(b)  (each such  Eligible  Assignee,  an "Assuming  Lender")  shall become a
Lender party to this  Agreement as of such Increase  Date and the  Commitment of
each  Increasing  Lender  for such  requested  Commitment  Increase  shall be so
increased by such amount (or by the amount  allocated to such Lender pursuant to
the last  sentence  of Section  2.17(b))  as of such  Increase  Date;  provided,
however,  that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the
following, each dated such date:

            (i) (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of
      each Loan Party or the  Executive  Committee of such Board  approving  the
      Commitment  Increase  and (B) an opinion of counsel  for the Loan  Parties
      (which may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibits D-1
      and D-2 hereto;

            (ii) an assumption  agreement from each Assuming Lender,  if any, in
      form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Guarantor and the Agent (each an
      "Assumption  Agreement"),  duly  executed by such Eligible  Assignee,  the
      Agent and the Guarantor; and

            (iii)  confirmation  from each Increasing  Lender of the increase in
      the amount of its  Commitment in a writing  satisfactory  to the Guarantor
      and the Agent.

On each Increase  Date,  upon  fulfillment  of the  conditions  set forth in the
immediately  preceding sentence of this Section 2.17(d),  the Agent shall notify
the Lenders (including,  without limitation,  each Assuming Lender) and the Loan
Parties, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier or telex, of
the occurrence of the  Commitment  Increase to be effected on such Increase Date
and shall record in the Register the relevant  information  with respect to each
Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date.

      the  matters   described  on  Schedule   3.01(b)  hereto  (the  "Disclosed
      Litigation")  or  (ii)  purports  to  affect  the  legality,  validity  or

            (c) Nothing shall have come to the  attention of the Lenders  during

      Bank N.V.,  as agent,  and each of the  Lenders  that is a party to either
      such credit agreement hereby waives, upon the execution of this Agreement,
      any  requirement  of  prior  notice  relating  to the  termination  of the
      commitments thereunder.

      SECTION 3.02.  Conditions  Precedent to Each Borrowing and Each Commitment
Increase.  The  obligation  of each Lender to make an Advance on the occasion of
each Borrowing and each  Commitment  Increase shall be subject to the conditions
precedent  that the  Effective  Date shall have occurred and on the date of such
Borrowing or such Increase Date (a) the following  statements shall be true (and
each of the giving of the applicable Notice of Borrowing, request for Commitment
Increase  and the  acceptance  by a Borrower of the  proceeds of such  Borrowing
shall constitute a representation and warranty by such Borrower that on the date
of such Borrowing or such Increase Date such statements are true):

            (i) the  representations  and  warranties  contained in Section 4.01
      (except, in the case of a Borrowing,  the representations set forth in the
      last sentence of subsection (e) thereof and in subsection  (f)(i) thereof)
      are correct on and as of such date, before and after giving effect to such

      proceeds therefrom, as though made on and as of such date, and

            (ii) no event has occurred and is  continuing,  or would result from
      such Borrowing or such Commitment  Increase or from the application of the
      proceeds therefrom, that constitutes a Default;

and (b) the  Agent  shall  have  received  such  other  approvals,  opinions  or
documents as any Lender through the Agent may reasonably request.

      SECTION  3.03.   Determinations   Under  Section  3.01.  For  purposes  of
determining  compliance  with the  conditions  specified in Section  3.01,  each
Lender  shall be deemed to have  consented  to,  approved  or  accepted or to be
satisfied with each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented
to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lenders unless an officer
of the Agent  responsible  for the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
shall  have  received  notice  from  such  Lender  prior  to the  date  that the
Borrowers,  by notice to the Lenders,  designate as the proposed Effective Date,
specifying its objection thereto. The Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of
the occurrence of the Effective Date.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      SECTION  4.01.  Representations  and  Warranties  of  the  Guarantor.  The
Guarantor represents and warrants as follows:

            (a)  Each  Loan  Party  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly

unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, the Guarantor will:

            (a)  Compliance  with  Laws,  Etc.  Comply,  and  cause  each of its
      Subsidiaries to comply with all applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations and
      orders, such compliance to include,  without  limitation,  compliance with
      ERISA and  Environmental  Laws  except,  in each case,  to the extent that

      Adverse Effect.

            (b) Payment of Taxes, Etc. Pay and discharge,  and cause each of its
      Subsidiaries   to  pay  and  discharge,   before  the  same  shall  become
      delinquent,  (i) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
      imposed upon it or upon its property and (ii) all lawful  claims that,  if
      unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon its property;  provided,  however,
      that neither the Guarantor nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall be required
      to pay or  discharge  any such tax,  assessment,  charge or claim  that is
      being  contested in good faith and by proper  proceedings  and as to which
      appropriate reserves are being maintained.

            (c)  Maintenance  of  Insurance.  Maintain,  and  cause  each of its
      Subsidiaries  to  maintain,   insurance  with  responsible  and  reputable
      insurance  companies or  associations  in such  amounts and covering  such
      risks as is usually carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and
      owning similar properties in the same general areas in which the Guarantor
      or such Subsidiary operates.

            (d) Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. Preserve and maintain,
      and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its corporate
      existence,  rights  (charter  and  statutory)  and  franchises;  provided,
      however, that the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may consummate any merger
      or consolidation permitted under Section 5.02(b) and provided further that
      neither the  Guarantor  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall be required to
      preserve any right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the Guarantor
      or such  Subsidiary  shall determine that the  preservation  thereof is no
      longer  desirable in the conduct of the business of the  Guarantor or such
      Subsidiary,  as the  case  may  be,  and  that  the  loss  thereof  is not
      disadvantageous in any material respect to the Guarantor,  such Subsidiary
      or the Lenders.

            (e) Visitation Rights. At any reasonable time and from time to time,
      permit the Agent or any of the  Lenders  or any agents or  representatives
      thereof,  to examine and make copies of and abstracts from the records and
      books of account of, and visit the properties of, the Guarantor and any of
      its Subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the

      directors and with their independent certified public accountants.

            (f) Keeping of Books.  Keep, and cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to
      keep,  proper  books of record  and  account,  in which  full and  correct
      entries  shall be made of all  financial  transactions  and the assets and

      Subsidiaries to conduct,  all transactions  otherwise permitted under this
      Agreement  with  any of  their  Affiliates  on  terms  that  are  fair and
      reasonable and no less favorable to the Guarantor or such  Subsidiary than
      it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not
      an Affiliate.

      indirectly,  enter  into  or  suffer  to  exist,  or  permit  any  of  its
      Subsidiaries  to  enter  into  or  suffer  to  exist,   any  agreement  or
      arrangement  limiting  the ability or any of its  Subsidiaries  to (i) pay
      dividends  or make any other  distributions  on its  capital  stock or any
      other interest or  participation  in its profits owned by the Guarantor or
      any of its  Subsidiaries,  or pay any Debt owed to the Guarantor or any of
      its  Subsidiaries,  (ii) make loans or advances to the  Guarantor or (iii)
      transfer any of its properties or assets to the Guarantor, except for such

unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, the Guarantor will:

            (a)  Leverage  Ratio.  Maintain  a ratio  of  Consolidated  Debt for
      Borrowed  Money of the  Guarantor  and its  Subsidiaries  to  Consolidated

      recently ended of not greater than 3.0 to 1.

            (b) Interest Coverage Ratio. Maintain a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA
      of the Guarantor and its  Subsidiaries for the four quarters most recently
      ended to interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect
      of, all Debt during such period by the Guarantor and its  Subsidiaries  of
      not less than 5.0 to 1.

      interest on any Advance or make any other payment of fees or other amounts
      payable under this  Agreement or any Note within three Business Days after
      the same becomes due and payable; or

            (b) Any  representation  or warranty made by the Guarantor herein or
      by any  Loan  Party  (or any of its  officers)  in  connection  with  this
      Agreement shall prove to have been incorrect in any material  respect when
      made; or

            (c) (i) The  Guarantor  shall fail to  perform or observe  any term,
      covenant or agreement contained in Section 5.01(d),  (e), (h) or (i), 5.02
      or 5.03, or (ii) any Loan Party shall fail to perform or observe any other
      term,  covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on its part to be

      Agent or any Lender; or

            (d) The Guarantor or any of its  Subsidiaries  shall fail to pay any
      principal of or premium or interest on any Debt that is  outstanding  in a

      shall exist under any  agreement or  instrument  relating to any such Debt
      and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in
      such agreement or instrument,  if the effect of such event or condition is

      Debt;  or any  such  Debt  shall be  declared  to be due and  payable,  or
      required  to be prepaid or redeemed  (other than by a regularly  scheduled
      required prepayment or redemption),  purchased or defeased, or an offer to

      a  bankrupt   or   insolvent,   or  seeking   liquidation,   winding   up,
      reorganization,    arrangement,   adjustment,   protection,   relief,   or

      an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver,  trustee,  custodian
      or  other  similar  official  for it or for  any  substantial  part of its
      property  and, in the case of any such  proceeding  instituted  against it
      (but  not  instituted  by  it),  either  such   proceeding   shall  remain
      undismissed  or  unstayed  for a period of 60 days,  or any of the actions
      sought in such proceeding (including,  without limitation, the entry of an
      order for relief  against,  or the  appointment  of a  receiver,  trustee,
      custodian or other similar official for, it or for any substantial part of
      its property)  shall occur;  or the  Guarantor or any of its  Subsidiaries
      shall take any corporate  action to authorize any of the actions set forth

      been  commenced by any creditor  upon such judgment or order or (ii) there
      shall  be any  period  of 60  consecutive  days  during  which  a stay  of
      enforcement  of such judgment or order,  by reason of a pending  appeal or
      otherwise,  shall  not be in  effect;  provided,  however,  that  any such
      judgment  or order  shall not be an Event of Default  under  this  Section
      6.01(f) if and for so long as (i) the amount of such  judgment or order is
      covered by a valid and binding  policy of insurance  between the defendant
      and the insurer  covering  payment  thereof and (ii) such  insurer,  which
      shall be rated at least "A" by A.M.  Best  Company,  has been notified of,
      and has not  disputed  the claim made for  payment  of, the amount of such
      judgment or order; or

            (g) (i) Any Person or two or more  Persons  acting in concert  shall
      have acquired  beneficial  ownership  (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of
      the Securities and Exchange  Commission under the Securities  Exchange Act

            (h) Any material  provision of the Guaranty  shall cease to be valid
      and binding on or  enforceable  against the  Guarantor,  or the  Guarantor
      shall so state in writing; or

            (i) The  Guarantor or any of its ERISA  Affiliates  shall incur,  or
      shall be reasonably  likely to incur liability in excess of $60,000,000 in

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the
consent,  of the  Required  Lenders,  by notice to the  Borrowers,  declare  the
obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be terminated,  whereupon the same
shall  forthwith  terminate,  and  (ii)  shall at the  request,  or may with the
consent,  of the  Required  Lenders,  by


                                       30
<PAGE>

notice to the  Borrowers,  declare the  Advances,  all interest  thereon and all
other  amounts  payable  under this  Agreement to be forthwith  due and payable,
whereupon the Advances,  all such interest and all such amounts shall become and
be forthwith due and payable,  without presentment,  demand,  protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby  expressly  waived by each Borrower;
provided,  however,  that in the event of an actual or deemed  entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Loan Party under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A)
the obligation of each Lender to make Advances shall automatically be terminated
and (B) the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically
become  and be due and  payable,  without  presentment,  demand,  protest or any
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTY

      SECTION 7.01. Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby absolutely,  unconditionally
and irrevocably  guarantees the punctual  payment when due, whether at scheduled
maturity or on any date of a required  prepayment or by acceleration,  demand or
otherwise, of all obligations of each other Loan Party now or hereafter existing
under or in  respect of the this  Agreement  and the Notes  (including,  without
limitation, any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals
of any  or  all of the  foregoing  obligations),  whether  direct  or  indirect,
absolute or contingent,  and whether for principal,  interest,  premiums,  fees,
indemnities,  contract  causes of action,  costs,  expenses or  otherwise  (such
obligations being the "Guaranteed  Obligations"),  and agrees to pay any and all
expenses  (including,  without limitation,  fees and expenses of outside counsel
and the allocated costs and expenses of in-house  counsel) incurred by the Agent
or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  the  Guarantor's  liability  shall extend to all
amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed  Obligations and would be owed by
any other  Loan  Party to the Agent or any  Lender  under or in  respect of this
Agreement  and the Notes but for the fact  that  they are  unenforceable  or not
allowable  due to the  existence  of a  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or  similar
proceeding involving such other Loan Party.

      SECTION  7.02.  Guaranty  Absolute.  The  Guarantor  guarantees  that  the
Guaranteed  Obligations  will be paid strictly in  accordance  with the terms of
this Agreement and the Notes,  regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Agent or any Lender  with  respect  thereto.  This  Guaranty is an
absolute and unconditional  guaranty of payment when due, and not of collection,
by the Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of the Guarantor
under  or in  respect  of  this  Guaranty  are  independent  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations or any other obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect
of this Agreement and the Notes, and a separate action or actions may be brought
and prosecuted  against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty,  irrespective of
whether any action is brought  against any  Borrower or whether any  Borrower is
joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be irrevocable,  absolute and unconditional  irrespective of, and
the  Guarantor  hereby  irrevocably  waives  any  defenses  it may  now  have or
hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

            (a) any lack of validity or  enforceability of any provision of this
      Agreement or any Note or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

            (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
      other  term of,  all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
      obligations  of any Borrower  under or in respect of this Agreement or the
      Notes,  or any other  amendment  or waiver of or any consent to  departure
      from this  Agreement  or the Notes,  including,  without  limitation,  any
      increase in the  Guaranteed  Obligations  resulting  from the extension of
      additional credit to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

            (c)  any  taking,   exchange,   release  or  non-perfection  of  any
      collateral,  or any taking,  release or amendment or waiver of, or consent
      to departure  from, any other  guaranty,  for all or any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations;

            (d) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to
      all or any of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any manner of sale or other
      disposition of any collateral for all or any of the


                                       31
<PAGE>

      Guaranteed  Obligations  or any other  obligations of any Loan Party under
      this  Agreement or the Notes or any other assets of any Borrower or any of
      its Subsidiaries;

            (e)  any  change,  restructuring  or  termination  of the  corporate
      structure or existence of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (f) any  failure  of the  Agent or any  Lender  to  disclose  to the
      Guarantor any information  relating to the business,  condition (financial
      or  otherwise),  operations,  performance,  properties or prospects of any
      Borrower now or hereafter known to the Agent or such Lender (the Guarantor
      waiving any duty on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose such
      information);

            (g) the failure of any other  Person to execute or deliver any other
      guaranty or  agreement  or the release or  reduction  of  liability of the
      Guarantor  or other  guarantor  or surety with  respect to the  Guaranteed
      Obligations; or

            (h) any  other  circumstance  (including,  without  limitation,  any
      statute  of   limitations)   or  any  existence  of  or  reliance  on  any
      representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise  constitute
      a defense  available  to, or a  discharge  of, any Loan Party or any other
      guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall  continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must  otherwise  be returned  by the Agent or any Lender or any other  Person
upon the insolvency,  bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise,
all as though such payment had not been made.

      SECTION  7.03.  Waivers  and  Acknowledgments.  (a) The  Guarantor  hereby
unconditionally  and  irrevocably  waives  promptness,   diligence,   notice  of
acceptance,  presentment,  demand  for  performance,  notice of  nonperformance,
default, acceleration,  protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the
Agent or any Lender protect,  secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property
subject  thereto or exhaust any right or take any action  against any Loan Party
or any other Person or any collateral.

            (b) The Guarantor hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
      right to revoke  this  Guaranty  and  acknowledges  that this  Guaranty is
      continuing in nature and applies to all  Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether
      existing now or in the future.

            (c) The Guarantor hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i)
      any  defense  arising  by  reason of any claim or  defense  based  upon an
      election  of  remedies  by the  Agent  or any  Lender  that in any  manner
      impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation,
      reimbursement,  exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the
      Guarantor or other rights of the  Guarantor to proceed  against any of the
      other  Loan  Parties,  any  other  guarantor  or any  other  Person or any
      collateral  and  (ii)  any  defense  based  on any  right  of  set-off  or
      counterclaim  against or in respect of the  obligations  of the  Guarantor
      hereunder.

            (d) The Guarantor hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
      duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose  to the  Guarantor
      any matter, fact or thing relating to the business,  condition  (financial
      or  otherwise),  operations,  performance,  properties or prospects of any
      other Loan Party or any of its  Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by the
      Agent or such Lender.

            (e) The  Guarantor  acknowledges  that it will  receive  substantial
      direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements  contemplated
      by this  Agreement and that the waivers set forth in Section 7.02 and this
      Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

      SECTION  7.04.  Subrogation.  The  Guarantor  hereby  unconditionally  and
irrevocably  agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against any Borrower or any other insider  guarantor


                                       32
<PAGE>

that  arise from the  existence,  payment,  performance  or  enforcement  of the
Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation,  reimbursement,  exoneration, contribution
or  indemnification  and any right to  participate in any claim or remedy of the
Agent or any Lender  against any Borrower or any other insider  guarantor or any
collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract,  statute or common law, including,  without  limitation,  the right to
take or receive from any Borrower or any other  insider  guarantor,  directly or
indirectly,  in cash or other  property  or by set-off  or in any other  manner,
payment or security on account of such claim,  remedy or right, unless and until
all of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and the  Commitments  shall have
expired or been  terminated.  If any amount  shall be paid to the  Guarantor  in
violation of the immediately  preceding  sentence at any time prior to the later
of the  payment  in full in cash of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all  other
amounts payable under this Guaranty and the Termination  Date, such amount shall
be received and held in trust for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders, shall be
segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be
paid or  delivered  to the  Agent  in the same  form as so  received  (with  any
necessary  endorsement  or  assignment)  to  be  credited  and  applied  to  the
Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other  amounts  payable  under  this  Guaranty,
whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or
to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable
under this Guaranty  thereafter arising. If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment
to the  Agent or any  Lender of all or any part of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,
(ii) all of the Guaranteed  Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty  shall  have been paid in full in cash and (iii) the  Termination  Date
shall have occurred,  the Agent and the Lenders will, at the Guarantor's request
and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without
recourse  and without  representation  or  warranty,  necessary  to evidence the
transfer by  subrogation  to the  Guarantor  of an  interest  in the  Guaranteed
Obligations  resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor  pursuant to this
Guaranty.

      SECTION 7.05. Subordination. The Guarantor hereby subordinates any and all
debts,  liabilities  and other  obligations  owed to the Guarantor by each other
Loan Party (the "Subordinated Obligations") to the Guaranteed Obligations to the
extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Section 7.05:

            (a) Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding under
      any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party,  the Guarantor agrees
      that the Agent and the Lenders  shall be  entitled  to receive  payment in
      full in cash of all  Guaranteed  Obligations  (including  all interest and
      expenses  accruing  after  the  commencement  of a  proceeding  under  any
      Bankruptcy  Law,  whether or not  constituting  an  allowed  claim in such
      proceeding  ("Post  Petition  Interest"))  before the  Guarantor  receives
      payment of any Subordinated Obligations.

            (b) Turn-Over.  After the  occurrence and during the  continuance of
      any Event of Default under Section  6.01(e),  the Guarantor  shall, if the
      Agent so requests, collect, enforce and receive payments on account of the
      Subordinated  Obligations  as trustee  for the Agent and the  Lenders  and
      deliver  such  payments  to  the  Agent  on  account  of  the   Guaranteed
      Obligations  (including  all Post  Petition  Interest),  together with any
      necessary  endorsements  or other  instruments  of  transfer,  but without
      reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the  Guarantor  under
      the other provisions of this Guaranty.

            (c)  Agent  Authorization.  After  the  occurrence  and  during  the
      continuance  of any Event of Default under Section  6.01(e),  the Agent is
      authorized  and  empowered  (but without any  obligation to so do), in its
      discretion,  (i) in the name of the Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and
      to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated  Obligations and to apply any
      amounts received thereon to the Guaranteed  Obligations (including any and
      all Post  Petition  Interest),  and (ii) to require the  Guarantor  (A) to
      collect and  enforce,  and to submit  claims in respect  of,  Subordinated
      Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to the
      Agent for application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all
      Post Petition Interest).

      SECTION  7.06.  Continuing  Guaranty;  Assignments.  This  Guaranty  is  a
continuing  guaranty  and shall (a) remain in full  force and  effect  until the
later of the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts  payable under this Guaranty and the  Termination  Date,  (b) be binding
upon the  Guarantor,  its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of
and  be  enforceable  by  the  Agent  and  the  Lenders  and  their


                                       33
<PAGE>

successors,  transferees and assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause
(c) of the immediately  preceding  sentence,  any Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer all or any portion of its rights and  obligations  under this Agreement
(including,  without  limitation,  all or any  portion of its  Commitments,  the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,  and
such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect
thereof  granted to such Lender herein or otherwise,  in each case as and to the
extent  provided  in Section  9.07.  The  Guarantor  shall not have the right to
assign its rights  hereunder or any interest  herein  without the prior  written
consent of each of the Lenders.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    THE AGENT

      SECTION 8.01.  Authorization  and Action.  Each Lender hereby appoints and
authorizes  the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms  hereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are  reasonably
incidental  thereto.  As to any  matters  not  expressly  provided  for by  this
Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  enforcement  or  collection of the
Notes),  the Agent shall not be required to exercise any  discretion or take any
action,  but shall be  required  to act or to refrain  from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders,  and such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all  holders  of  Notes;  provided,  however,  that the  Agent  shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this  Agreement  or  applicable  law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Loan Party  pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement.

      SECTION  8.02.  Agent's  Reliance,  Etc.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in  connection  with this  Agreement,
except  for its or their own gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct.  Without
limitation of the  generality  of the  foregoing,  the Agent:  (i) may treat the
Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until
the Agent  receives  and  accepts an  Assumption  Agreement  entered  into by an
Assuming  Lender as provided in Section  2.17 or an  Assignment  and  Acceptance
entered into by such Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee,
as provided in Section  9.07;  (ii) may consult  with legal  counsel  (including
counsel for the Loan Parties),  independent public accountants and other experts
selected  by it and shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or omitted to be
taken  in good  faith  by it in  accordance  with the  advice  of such  counsel,
accountants or experts;  (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
and shall not be  responsible  to any Lender for any  statements,  warranties or
representations  (whether  written or oral) made in or in  connection  with this
Agreement;  (iv)  shall not have any duty to  ascertain  or to inquire as to the
performance,  observance  or  satisfaction  of any of the  terms,  covenants  or
conditions  of this  Agreement on the part of any Loan Party or the existence at
any time of any  Default or to inspect  the  property  (including  the books and
records) of any Loan Party;  (v) shall not be  responsible to any Lender for the
due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto;  and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement
by acting upon any notice,  consent,  certificate or other instrument or writing
(which may be by telecopier, telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and
signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

      SECTION 8.03. Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the
Advances  made by it and any Note  issued to it,  Citibank  shall  have the same
rights and powers under this  Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent;  and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless  otherwise  expressly  indicated,  include  Citibank  in  its  individual
capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept  deposits from, lend money to,
act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment  banking  engagements from
and generally  engage in any kind of business with,  the  Guarantor,  any of its
Subsidiaries  and any Person who may do business  with or own  securities of the
Guarantor  or any such  Subsidiary,  all as if  Citibank  were not the Agent and
without  any duty to account  therefor to the  Lenders.  The Agent shall have no
duty to disclose information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Guarantor or its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was
obtained or received in any capacity other than as Agent.

      SECTION 8.04.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender  acknowledges  that it
has,  independently  and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on the  financial  statements  referred to in Section  4.01 and such other
documents  and  information  as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit
analysis  and  decision  to  enter  into  this   Agreement.   Each  Lender  also
acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

      SECTION  8.05.  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent
(to the  extent not  reimbursed  by the  Borrowers),  ratably  according  to the
respective principal amounts of the Advances then owed to each of them (or if no
Advances  are at the  time  outstanding,  ratably  according  to the  respective
amounts  of  their  Commitments),  from  and  against  any and all  liabilities,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements  of any kind or nature  whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of this  Agreement  or any action  taken or omitted by the Agent  under this
Agreement (collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"), provided that no Lender shall
be liable for any portion of the  Indemnified  Costs  resulting from the Agent's
gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without  limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender agrees to reimburse  the Agent  promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred
by  the  Agent  in  connection  with  the  preparation,   execution,   delivery,
administration,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities  under, this Agreement,  to the extent that the Agent
is not  reimbursed  for  such  expenses  by the  Borrowers.  In the  case of any
investigation,  litigation or proceeding  giving rise to any Indemnified  Costs,
this  Section  8.05  applies  whether  any  such  investigation,  litigation  or
proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

      SECTION 8.06.  Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written  notice  thereof to the Lenders and the  Borrowers and may be removed at
any  time  with  or  without  cause  by the  Required  Lenders.  Upon  any  such
resignation or removal,  the Required  Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent from among the Lenders with the consent,  so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, of the Guarantor, which consent will not
be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed.  If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required  Lenders,  and shall have accepted  such  appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders,  appoint a successor Agent,  which shall be a Lender that
is a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or
of any State  thereof  and having a  combined  capital  and  surplus of at least
$500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any  appointment  as Agent  hereunder by a
successor  Agent,  such successor  Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become
vested with all the rights,  powers,  discretion,  privileges  and duties of the
retiring  Agent,  and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations  under this  Agreement.  After any retiring  Agent's  resignation or
removal  hereunder as Agent,  the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to
its  benefit as to any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Agreement.

      SECTION 8.07.  Sub-Agent.  The Sub-Agent  has been  designated  under this
Agreement to carry out duties of the Agent.  The  Sub-Agent  shall be subject to
each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent,  and
each of the  Borrowers  and the  Lenders  agrees  that  the  Sub-Agent  shall be
entitled  to  exercise  each of the rights and shall be  entitled to each of the
benefits of the Agent under this  Agreement as relate to the  performance of its
obligations hereunder.

      SECTION 8.08. Other Agents.  Each Lender hereby  acknowledges that neither
the  documentation  agent nor any other Lender  designated as any "Agent" on the
signature pages hereof (other than the Agent) has any liability  hereunder other
than in its capacity as a Lender.

      SECTION 9.01. Amendments,  Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this  Agreement  or the Notes,  nor consent to any  departure  by any Loan Party
therefrom,  shall in any event be effective  unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the  Required  Lenders,  and then such waiver or consent  shall be
effective only in the specific  instance and for the specific  purpose for which

Lenders,  (c) reduce the  principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees

payable  hereunder,  (e)  change the  percentage  of the  Commitments  or of the
aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount of the Advances,  or the number of Lenders,
that  shall  be  required  for the  Lenders  or any of them to take  any  action
hereunder,  (f)  amend  the  definition  of  "Committed  Currencies"  to add any
additional currency,  (g) reduce or limit the obligations of the Guarantor under

liability  with  respect to the  obligations  owing to the Agent and the Lenders
under Article VII or (h) amend this Section 9.01;  and provided  further that no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in
addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or
duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note.

      SECTION 9.02. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications  provided
for hereunder shall be in writing  (including  telecopier,  telegraphic or telex
communication) and mailed, telecopied,  telegraphed, telexed or delivered, if to

mailed,  telecopied,  telegraphed or telexed, be effective when deposited in the
mails,  telecopied,  delivered  to the  telegraph  company or confirmed by telex
answerback,  respectively,  except that notices and  communications to the Agent

manually executed counterpart thereof.

      SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or
the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising,  any right hereunder or under
any Note  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

      SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay on demand
all  costs  and  expenses  of the  Agent in  connection  with  the  preparation,
execution,  delivery,   administration,   modification  and  amendment  of  this
Agreement,  the  Notes  and  the  other  documents  to be  delivered  hereunder,
including,  without limitation,  (A) all due diligence,  syndication  (including
printing,   distribution   and   bank   meetings),   transportation,   computer,
duplication,  appraisal,  consultant,  and audit expenses and (B) the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect
to  advising  the  Agent  as to  its  rights  and  responsibilities  under  this
Agreement.  The Borrowers  further agree to pay on demand all costs and expenses
of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation,  reasonable
fees and  expenses of outside  counsel and the  allocated  costs and expenses of
in-house  counsel),   in  connection  with  the  enforcement   (whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement,  the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered  hereunder,  including,  without limitation,
reasonable  fees and  expenses  of  counsel  for the  Agent  and each  Lender in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a).

      (b) The Borrowers  agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each
Lender and each of their  Affiliates and their officers,  directors,  employees,
agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified  Party") from and against any and all
claims,   damages,   losses,   liabilities  and  expenses  (including,   without
limitation,  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or asserted or
awarded  against  any  Indemnified  Party,  in each  case  arising  out of or in
connection with or by reason of (including,  without  limitation,  in connection
with any investigation,  litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in
connection  therewith) (i) the Notes,  this


                                       36
<PAGE>

Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed
use of the  proceeds of the  Advances or (ii) the actual or alleged  presence of
hazardous  materials on any property of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries
or any  Environmental  Action relating in any way to the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries,  except to the extent  such  claim,  damage,  loss,  liability  or
expense is found in a final,  non-appealable  judgment  by a court of  competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified  Party's gross negligence or
willful  misconduct.  In the  case  of an  investigation,  litigation  or  other
proceeding  to  which  the  indemnity  in this  Section  9.04(b)  applies,  such
indemnity shall be effective  whether or not such  investigation,  litigation or
proceeding  is  brought  by any Loan  Party,  its  directors,  equityholders  or
creditors  or an  Indemnified  Party or any  other  Person,  whether  or not any
Indemnified  Party  is  otherwise  a  party  thereto  and  whether  or  not  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby are consummated.  The Loan Parties also agree
not to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
against  the  Agent,  any  Lender,  any of  their  Affiliates,  or any of  their
respective directors,  officers, employees,  attorneys and agents, on any theory
of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement,
any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Advances.

      (c) If any payment of principal  of, or  Conversion  of, any  Eurocurrency
Rate Advance is made by any Borrower to or for the account of a Lender (i) other
than on the last day of the Interest  Period for such Advance,  as a result of a
payment or Conversion  pursuant to Section 2.07,  2.09 or 2.11,  acceleration of
the maturity of the Notes  pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason,  or
by an Eligible  Assignee to a Lender  other than on the last day of the Interest
Period for such Advance upon an assignment of rights and obligations  under this
Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  9.07 as a result of a demand by the  Guarantor
pursuant  to  Section  9.07(a)  or (ii) as a result of a payment  or  Conversion
pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.09 or 2.11, the Borrower of such Advance shall, upon
demand by such  Lender  (with a copy of such  demand to the  Agent),  pay to the
Agent for the  account of such Lender any amounts  required to  compensate  such
Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment or Conversion,  including,  without limitation,  any
loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason
of the  liquidation or  reemployment  of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender to fund or maintain such Advance. If the amount of the Committed Currency
purchased by any Lender in the case of a  Conversion  or exchange of Advances in
the case of Section  2.07 or 2.11  exceeds  the sum  required  to  satisfy  such
Lender's  liability in respect of such Advances,  such Lender agrees to remit to
the applicable Borrower such excess.

      (d)  Without  prejudice  to the  survival  of any other  agreement  of the
Borrowers  hereunder,  the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained
in Sections 2.10,  2.13 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes.

      SECTION 9.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon (i) the  occurrence  and during the
continuance  of any Event of Default  and (ii) the making of the  request or the
granting of the consent  specified  by Section  6.01 to  authorize  the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section 6.01,
each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or final) at
any time held and other  indebtedness  at any time owing by such  Lender or such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party  against any and
all of the  obligations of such Loan Party now or hereafter  existing under this
Agreement  and any Note held by such  Lender,  whether or not such Lender  shall
have  made any  demand  under  this  Agreement  or such Note and  although  such
obligations  may be  unmatured.  Each  Lender  agrees  promptly  to  notify  the
applicable Loan Party after any such set-off and application,  provided that the
failure to give such notice  shall not affect the  validity of such  set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including,  without limitation,  other
rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.

      SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other
than Section 2.01,  which shall only become  effective upon  satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed
by each Loan Party and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been  notified by
each  Initial  Lender that such Initial  Lender has  executed it and  thereafter
shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the Loan  Parties,  the Agent
and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan
Party shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein
without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

      SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations.  (a) Each Lender may and, if
demanded by the Guarantor (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section
2.10 or 2.13) upon at least five  Business  Days'  notice to such Lender and the
Agent,  will  assign to one or more  Persons  all or a portion of its rights and
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  all or a
portion of its  Commitment,  the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held
by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant,
and  not a  varying,  percentage  of  all  rights  and  obligations  under  this
Agreement,  (ii)  except  in  the  case  of  an  assignment  to a  Person  that,
immediately prior to such assignment,  was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  amount  of the
Commitment  of the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
assignment  (determined as of the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with
respect to such  assignment)  shall in no event be less than  $10,000,000  or an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess  thereof unless the Guarantor and the
Agent  otherwise  agree,  (iii)  each such  assignment  shall be to an  Eligible
Assignee,  (iv)  each  such  assignment  made as a  result  of a  demand  by the
Guarantor  pursuant to this Section  9.07(a)  shall be arranged by the Guarantor
after  consultation  with the Agent and shall be either an  assignment of all of
the rights and  obligations  of the assigning  Lender under this Agreement or an
assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations  made  concurrently  with
another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the
rights and  obligations  of the assigning  Lender under this  Agreement,  (v) no
Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by
the  Guarantor  pursuant to this  Section  9.07(a)  unless and until such Lender
shall have  received one or more  payments  from either the  Borrowers or one or
more Eligible  Assignees in an aggregate  amount at least equal to the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all
other amounts  payable to such Lender under this  Agreement and (vi) the parties
to each  such  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver  to the  Agent,  for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, payable by the parties to each such assignment,  provided, however, that
in the case of each  assignment  made as a result of a demand by the  Guarantor,
such  recordation  fee shall be payable  by the  Guarantor  except  that no such
recordation  fee  shall  be  payable  in the case of an  assignment  made at the
request of the  Guarantor to an Eligible  Assignee  that is an existing  Lender.
Upon such  execution,  delivery,  acceptance and  recording,  from and after the
effective date specified in each  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  (x) the assignee
thereunder  shall  be a  party  hereto  and,  to  the  extent  that  rights  and
obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such  Assignment and
Acceptance,  have the rights and  obligations of a Lender  hereunder and (y) the
Lender  assignor  thereunder  shall,  to the extent that rights and  obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such  Assignment and  Acceptance,
relinquish  its rights (other than its rights under Section 2.10,  2.13 and 9.04
to the  extent  any claim  thereunder  relates  to an event  arising  prior such
assignment) and be released from its  obligations  under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining  portion
of an assigning  Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

      (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,  the Lender
assignor  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty  and  assumes  no  responsibility   with  respect  to  any  statements,
warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto;  (ii) such  assigning  Lender  makes no  representation  or warranty and

obligations  under this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished
pursuant  hereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement,  together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section  4.01  and  such  other  documents  and  information  as it  has  deemed
appropriate  to make its own credit  analysis  and  decision  to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance;  (iv) such assignee will,  independently  and without
reliance upon the Agent,  such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on

this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi)
such assignee  appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers and  discretion  under this  Agreement as
are  delegated to the Agent by the terms  hereof,  together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably  incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

      (c) Upon its  receipt  of an  Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed  by an
assigning Lender and an assignee  representing that it is an Eligible  Assignee,
together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment,  the Agent shall, if
such  Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in  substantially  the
form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record
the information  contained  therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrowers.

      (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address  referred to in Section 9.02 a
copy of each Assumption  Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered
to and  accepted  by it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the  names and
addresses  of the Lenders and the  Commitment  of, and  principal  amount of the
Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the  "Register").  The entries
in the  Register  shall be  conclusive  and  binding  for all  purposes,  absent
manifest  error,  and each Loan Party,  the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person  whose name is recorded in the  Register  as a Lender  hereunder  for all
purposes of this  Agreement.  The Register  shall be available for inspection by
any Loan Party or any Lender at any  reasonable  time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

      (e) Each  Lender  may sell  participations  to one or more  banks or other
entities  (other than the Guarantor or any of its  Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  (including,  without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  its  Commitment to the
Borrowers  hereunder)  shall  remain  unchanged,  (ii) such Lender  shall remain
solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such
obligations,  (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection  with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve any  amendment or
waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement  or any Note,  or any consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent  would reduce the  principal  of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder,  in each case to the extent subject
to such  participation,  or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in
each case to the extent  subject to such  participation,  or reduce or limit the
obligations  of the Guarantor  under Section 7.01 or release the Guarantor  from
its obligations under Article VII.

      (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or  participation or
proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information
relating  to the  Guarantor  furnished  to such  Lender  by or on  behalf of the
Guarantor;  provided  that,  prior  to any  such  disclosure,  the  assignee  or
participant  or proposed  assignee or  participant  shall agree to preserve  the
confidentiality  of any  Confidential  Information  relating  to  the  Guarantor
received by it from such Lender.

      (g) Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in this Agreement,  any
Lender may at any time  create a security  interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the Advances owing
to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal  Reserve Bank in
accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve
System.

      SECTION  9.08.  Confidentiality.  Neither  the Agent nor any Lender  shall
disclose any Confidential Information to any other Person without the consent of
the  Guarantor,  other than (a) to the Agent's or such Lender's  Affiliates  and
their officers,  directors,  employees, agents and advisors and, as contemplated
by Section 9.07(f),  to actual or prospective  assignees and  participants,  and
then  only  on a  confidential  basis,  (b) as  required  by any  law,  rule  or
regulation  or  judicial  process,  (c) as  requested  or required by any state,
federal or foreign authority or examiner  regulating banks or banking and (d) in
connection  with the exercise of any remedies  hereunder or any suit,  action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder.

      SECTION  9.09.  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  and the  Notes  shall be
governed by, and  construed  in  accordance  with,  the laws of the State of New
York.

      SECTION 9.10. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed  shall be


                                       39

deemed to be an original and all of which taken  together  shall  constitute one
and the same agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this  Agreement  by  telecopier  shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

      SECTION 9.11.  Judgment.  (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in
any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another
currency,  the  parties  hereto  agree,  to the  fullest  extent  that  they may
effectively  do so,  that the rate of  exchange  used  shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking  procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with
such  other  currency  at  Citibank's  principal  office in London at 11:00 A.M.
(London  time) on the Business  Day  preceding  that on which final  judgment is
given.

      (b) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary
to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency into Dollars, the parties
agree to the fullest  extent that they may  effectively  do so, that the rate of
exchange  used  shall  be  that at  which  in  accordance  with  normal  banking
procedures  the Agent could  purchase  such  Committed  Currency with Dollars at
Citibank's  principal  office  in  London  at 11:00  A.M.  (London  time) on the
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

      (c) The  obligation  of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due from it in
any  currency  (the  "Primary  Currency")  to any Lender or the Agent  hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to
the extent  that on the  Business  Day  following  receipt by such Lender or the
Agent  (as the case  may be),  of any sum  adjudged  to be so due in such  other
currency,  such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance  with
normal banking  procedures  purchase the applicable  Primary  Currency with such
other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is
less than  such sum due to such  Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the
applicable Primary Currency,  the Borrowers agree, as a separate  obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be)  against  such loss,  and if the amount of the  applicable  Primary
Currency so  purchased  exceeds  such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) in the applicable  Primary  Currency,  such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) agrees to remit to the applicable Borrower such excess.

      SECTION  9.12.  Jurisdiction,  Etc. (a) Each of the parties  hereto hereby
irrevocably and  unconditionally  submits,  for itself and its property,  to the
nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any New York State court or federal  court of the
United States of America  sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any  thereof,  in any action or  proceeding  arising  out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Notes, or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and
each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that
all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and
determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent  permitted by law,
in such federal court.  The Loan Parties hereby agree that service of process in
any such action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State court or in
such  federal  court may be made upon the  Guarantor  at its offices at One East
Weaver Street, Greenwich,  Connecticut 06831 Attention:  General Counsel and the
Loan Parties hereby  irrevocably  appoint the Guarantor its authorized  agent to
accept such service of process,  and agrees that the failure of the Guarantor to
give any notice of any such  service  shall not impair or affect the validity of
such  service or of any  judgment  rendered  in any action or  proceeding  based
thereon.  Each Loan Party hereby further irrevocably  consents to the service of
process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any
parties hereto by registered or certified mail,  postage  prepaid,  to such Loan
Party at its address  specified  pursuant to Section  9.02.  Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final  judgment in any such action or  proceeding  shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right  that any  party may  otherwise  have to bring  any  action or  proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

      (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally  waives, to
the fullest  extent it may legally and  effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or  hereafter  have to the  laying  of  venue  of any  suit,  action  or
proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal  court.  Each of the  parties  hereto  hereby  irrevocably
waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

      SECTION  9.13.  Substitution  of  Currency.  If a change in any  Committed
Currency  occurs  pursuant to any  applicable  law,  rule or  regulation  of any
governmental,  monetary or multi-national  authority, this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the definitions of Eurocurrency Rate) will be amended to the
extent


                                       40
<PAGE>

determined  by the  Agent  (acting  reasonably  and  in  consultation  with  the
Guarantor)  to be  necessary  to reflect the change in  currency  and to put the
Lenders and the Borrowers in the same  position,  so far as possible,  that they
would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency had occurred.


                                       41

      SECTION 9.14.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each of the Loan Parties,  the Agent
and the  Lenders  hereby  irrevocably  waives  all right to trial by jury in any
action,   proceeding  or  counterclaim  (whether  based  on  contract,  tort  or
otherwise)  arising  out of or relating  to this  Agreement  or the Notes or the
actions  of  the  Agent  or  any  Lender  in  the  negotiation,  administration,
performance or enforcement thereof.

      IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties  hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,  as of the date
first above written.

                              DISCLOSED LITIGATION

      On June 13, 2002, a lawsuit was filed against  Omnicom Group Inc.  ("OGI")
and certain of OGI's  senior  executives  in the federal  court in the  Southern
District of New York on behalf of a purported  class of purchasers of OGI common
shares during the period April 25, 2000 to June 11, 2002. The  executives  named
as defendants are OGI's  chairman,  chief  executive  officer,  chief  financial
officer and controller.  The complaint alleges,  among other things,  that OGI's
press  releases  and SEC  reports  during the  alleged  class  period  contained
materially  false  and  misleading  statements  or  omitted  to  state  material
information  relating  to (1) OGI's  calculation  of the  organic  component  of
period-to-period  revenue growth, (2) the formation of Seneca Investments LLC in
May 2001, and (3) the characterization of acquisition payments and the existence
and amount of OGI's future obligations in respect of acquisitions. The complaint
seeks an  unspecified  amount of money  damages plus  attorneys'  fees and other
costs.  Ten other  complaints were  subsequently  filed in the same court,  each
making similar  allegations and  referencing  the same class period.  All of the
cases are at a preliminary stage.

      In addition to the proceedings  described above, a shareholder  derivative
action was filed on June 28,  2002 in New York state court in New York City by a
plaintiff shareholder,  purportedly on OGI's behalf, against current and certain
former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, disclosure failures, abuse
of control and gross  mismanagement  in connection with the formation of Seneca,
including  as a result  of  open-market  sales  of OGI  common  shares  by OGI's
chairman and two former employee  directors during the period August 2001 to May
2002.  The complaint  seeks the  imposition of a  constructive  trust on profits
received  in the  stock  sales,  an  unspecified  amount  of money  damages  and
attorneys' fees and other costs.

      The case names and numbers are as follows:

      1) Fisher v. Omnicom Group Inc., No. 02-CV-4483

  as of November 14, 2002
  among Omnicom Finance Inc.,

       Omnicom Finance Inc., Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance plc

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      This opinion is furnished  to you pursuant to Section  3.01(h)(iv)  of the
Three Year Credit  Agreement,  dated as of  _______________,  2002 (the  "Credit
Agreement"),  among Omnicom Finance Inc.  ("OFI"),  Omnicom Capital Inc. ("OCI")
and  Omnicom  Finance  plc  ("OFP",  and,  collectively  with OFI and  OCI,  the
"Borrowers"), Omnicom Group Inc. (the "Guarantor"), the Lenders parties thereto,
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and ABN AMRO Incorporated,  as lead arrangers and book
managers,  ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as  syndication  agent,  HSBC Bank USA,  Wachovia
Bank, National  Association and Societe Generale,  as documentation  agents, and
Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders. Capitalized terms used herein without
definition are used as defined in the Credit Agreement.

      We have acted as New York counsel for the Loan Parties in connection  with
the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

      In  connection  with this opinion,  we have  examined  originals or copies
(including conformed copies) of the following documents:

            (1) The Credit Agreement.

            (2) The documents  furnished by the Loan Parties pursuant to Article
      III of the Credit Agreement.

            (3) The Certificate of Incorporation and all amendments thereto (the
      "Charter")  of each of OFI, OCI and the Guarantor  (collectively,  the "US
      Loan  Parties"),  as certified as of a recent date by a public official of
      the state of its incorporation.

            (4) The by-laws and all amendments  thereto (the  "By-laws") of each
      US Loan Party, as certified to us by each US Loan Party.

<PAGE>

            (5) A  certificate  of the  Secretary  of State of  Delaware,  dated
      _______________,  2002, attesting to the continued corporate existence and
      good standing of OFI in that State as of the date thereof.

            (6) A certificate  of the Secretary of State of  Connecticut,  dated
      _____________,  2002,  attesting to the continued  corporate existence and
      good standing of OCI in that State as of the date thereof.

            (7) A  certificate  of the  Secretary  of State of New  York,  dated
      ________________, 2002, attesting to the continued corporate existence and
      good standing of the Guarantor in that State as of the date thereof.

      In addition, we have examined originals or copies,  certified or otherwise
identified  to  our  satisfaction,   of  such  records,  instruments  and  other
documents,  and have made such other investigations,  as we have deemed relevant
and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.

      For the purposes hereof, we have assumed, with your permission and without
independent verification of any kind: (a) that the signatures of persons signing
all documents in connection  with which this opinion is rendered are genuine and
authorized;  (b) the  legal  capacity  of all  natural  persons;  (c)  that  all
documents submitted to us as originals or duplicate originals are authentic; and
(d) that all  documents  submitted  to us as copies,  whether  certified or not,
conform to authentic  original  documents.  As to questions of fact  relevant to
this opinion, we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification
of any kind,  the accuracy of the  representations  and  warranties  of the Loan
Parties in the Credit  Agreement and have relied upon  certificates  and oral or
written  statements and other information of public officials,  and officers and
representatives  of the Loan  Parties.  For purposes of the opinion set forth in
the  paragraph  numbered 1 below,  we have  relied  solely  upon  copies of good
standing  certificates  as certified by public  officials as of the dates and in
the jurisdictions listed on Annex I hereto.

      In rendering the opinions  expressed  below,  we have  assumed,  with your
permission and without any  independent  investigation  or  verification  of any
kind,  that:  OFP has been duly  organized  and is validly  existing and in good
standing  under  the  laws  of its  jurisdiction  of  incorporation  and is duly
qualified in each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership of its property makes such qualification necessary;  (ii) OFP has full
power and  authority  to execute,  deliver and perform the Credit  Documents  to
which it is a party; (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit
Documents by OFP have been duly authorized by all requisite  corporate action on
the part of OFP; (iv) the Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered
by OFP; and (v) the execution,  delivery and performance of the Credit Documents
by OFP do not and will not violate the Charter,  By-laws or other organizational
documents of OFP. We have further assumed,  with your permission and without any
independent investigation or verification of any kind, that the Credit Agreement
constitutes  the valid and  legally  binding  obligation  of each  Person  party
thereto  (other than the US Loan  Parties  and OFP),  enforceable  against  such
Person in  accordance  with its terms.  Furthermore,  in giving the opinions set
forth in paragraphs numbered 4, 5 and 6 below, we express no opinion as to state
securities or blue sky laws.

      Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations set forth herein,
we are of the opinion that:

      1.  Each US Loan  Party  (i) is a  validly  existing  corporation  in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation listed on Annex
I hereto and (ii) has the corporate  power and authority to own its property and
assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged.

      2. Each US Loan Party has the  corporate  power to  execute,  deliver  and
perform the terms and  provisions  of the Credit  Agreement  and the Notes to be
delivered by it and has taken all  necessary  corporate  action to authorize the
execution,  delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be
delivered by it. Each US Loan Party has duly  executed and  delivered the Credit
Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it.

<PAGE>

      3.  The  Credit  Agreement   constitutes  the  legal,  valid  and  binding
obligation of each Loan Party enforceable  against such Loan Party in accordance
with its terms.  Each Note to be delivered by a Loan Party will  constitute  the
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party enforceable  against such
Loan Party in accordance with its terms.

      4. Neither the execution and delivery, nor the performance, by any US Loan
Party of the Credit Agreement or the Notes to be delivered by it, nor compliance
by such US Loan Party with the terms and provisions thereof, (i) will contravene
any  provision  of any law,  statute,  rule or  regulation  (including,  without
limitation,  Regulation  X of the  Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve
System) of the United  States of America or the State of New York  applicable to
such US Loan Party or (ii) will violate any  provision of the Charter or By-Laws
of such US Loan Party.

      5. Neither the execution and delivery, nor the performance,  by OFP of the
Credit  Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it, nor compliance by it with
the terms and  provisions  thereof,  will  contravene  any provision of any law,
statute, rule or regulation (including, without limitation,  Regulation X of the
Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System) of the  United  States of
America or the State of New York applicable to OFP.

      6. No order, consent, approval,  license,  authorization or validation of,
or filing,  recording or registration with (except as have been obtained or made
on or prior to the date  hereof),  or exemption by, any  governmental  or public
body or  authority  of the United  States of America,  or the State of New York,
applicable  to any Loan  Party is  required  to  authorize,  or is  required  in
connection  with, (i) the execution,  delivery and performance by any Loan Party
of the  Credit  Agreement  and the  Notes  to be  delivered  by it or  (ii)  the
enforceability  of the Credit  Agreement  and the Notes to be delivered by it in
accordance with their terms against such Loan Party.

      7. The choice of New York law as the governing law of the Credit Agreement
and the Notes is,  under  the laws of the State of New York,  a valid  choice of
law.

      8. The consent by each Loan Party in Section 9.12 of the Credit  Agreement
to the  jurisdiction  of  courts  sitting  in the  State  of New York is a valid
consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.

      Our opinions are subject to the qualifications that:

      A. The  enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is subject to
and  may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  fraudulent
conveyance,  moratorium,  or other  similar laws  relating to or  affecting  the
rights of  creditors  generally  (including  such as may deny  giving  effect to
waivers of debtors'  or  guarantors'  rights),  and the  application  of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), including,  without limitation,  (i) the possible  unavailability of
specific  performance,  injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii)
concepts  of   materiality,   reasonableness,   good  faith  and  fair  dealing.
Accordingly,  no opinion is given herein as to (i) the availability of the right
to accelerate  any obligation  and certain  remedies  provided for in the Credit
Agreement in the event of a nonmaterial  default,  or (ii) the enforceability of
any  provision of the Credit  Agreement  relating to  cumulation  of remedies or
waiving the remedy of specific performance, or the waiver of debtors' rights.

      B. We  express  no opinion  as to the  enforceability  of any  contractual
provision  in  the  Credit  Agreement  as to  waiver  of any  procedural  right,
including,  without limitation, (i) the first sentence of Section 9.12(a) of the
Credit  Agreement  insofar  as  such  sentence  relates  to the  subject  matter
jurisdiction  of a federal court of the United States of America  sitting in New
York City to adjudicate any controversy  related to any of the Credit Documents,
and (ii) the waiver of  inconvenient  forum set forth in Section  9.12(b) of the
Credit  Agreement  with respect to  proceedings in a federal court of the United
States of America sitting in New York City.

<PAGE>

      C. We  express  no opinion  as to the  enforceability  of any  contractual
provision  in the  Credit  Documents  relating  to  indemnification,  including,
without  limitation,  with respect to the  enforceability of Section 9.04 of the
Credit  Agreement,  to the extent  that these may be limited  (i) in the case of
litigation  against  any Loan  Party  which is decided  adversely  to the person
claiming  indemnification or in a case involving a claim of indemnification  for
attorneys' fees, (ii) by laws rendering unenforceable  indemnification  contrary
to federal or state securities laws and the public policy  underlying such laws,
or (iii) by laws  limiting  the  enforceability  of  provisions  exculpating  or
exempting a party, or requiring  indemnification  of a party,  for liability for
its own action or inaction,  to the extent the action or inaction involves gross
negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.

      D. Furthermore, no opinion is given herein as to:

            (i)  Section  7.02 of the Credit  Agreement,  to the extent  that it
      relates to action  contemplated by Section 7.02(b) of the Credit Agreement
      taken without the Guarantor's consent, which may not be enforceable to the
      extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially altered; or

            (ii) the  enforceability  of the  provisions  of Section 9.11 of the
      Credit  Agreement  (A) to the extent that a judgment not in (1) Dollars is
      obtained in respect of the Credit  Agreement in a jurisdiction  other than
      the United  States of America or (2)  Committed  Currencies is obtained in
      respect  of  the  Credit   Agreement  in  a  jurisdiction   other  than  a
      member-state of the European Union and the respective Loan Party pays such
      judgment or (B) insofar as those provisions  contemplate an alternative or
      additional  cause of action for a claim that may have  merged  with claims
      covered by an earlier judgment; or

            (iii)  Section  7.02(h)  of the Credit  Agreement,  to the extent it
      relates to any waiver of an applicable statute of limitations; or

            (iv) the  enforceability  of the  right of  setoff  provided  for in
      Section 9.05 of the Credit  Agreement (A) in respect of an interest  under
      the Credit  Agreement  purchased  by a Lender  pursuant to Section 2.14 or
      9.07 of the Credit Agreement, to the extent the relevant purchase does not
      give rise to a direct  obligation  of any Borrower to such Lender,  or (B)
      insofar as that right relates to setoff of unmatured obligations under the
      Credit  Agreement or of obligations owed to any Loan Party by an Affiliate
      of a Lender or by an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent.

      We are  members of the Bar of the State of New York and express no opinion
as to the laws of any jurisdiction  other than those of the laws of the State of

Our Ref MHL/539576

      November 2002

Dear Sirs

Omnicom Finance plc

1           Introduction

            We have acted as special  English lawyers for Omnicom Finance plc, a
            company  incorporated  and  existing  under the laws of England  and
            Wales ("OFP"), in connection with its authorisation of the execution
            and  delivery  of the  following  documents  (together,  the "Credit
            Documents"):

1.1         the 364-Day  Credit  Agreement  dated as of November 2002 made among
            Omnicom Finance Inc.,  Omnicom  Capital Inc. and OFP  (collectively,
            the  "Borrowers"),  Omnicom  Group Inc.  as  Guarantor,  the initial
            Lenders  named  therein,  Salomon Smith Barney Inc. as lead arranger
            and book manager and Citibank,  N.A. as Administrative Agent for the
            Lenders (the "Credit Agreement"); and

1.2         the  Notes of OFP,  if any,  to be  delivered  pursuant  to  Section
            2.15(a) of the Credit Agreement.

            We have been asked by OFP to give you this  opinion for the purposes
            of Section  3.01(h)(iv)  of the Credit  Agreement  and we have taken
            instructions  in this regard  solely  from OFP.  You should be aware
            that our sole  involvement  with this transaction has been in giving
            this opinion and we have not been involved in the negotiation of the
            Credit Documents or in any other aspect of the transaction.

            Terms  defined in the Credit  Agreement  have the same meanings when
            used in this opinion.

2           English law opinion

            This  opinion is limited  to English  law as applied by the  English
            courts as at the date of this  letter and is given on the basis that
            it will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.
            We have made no investigation of the laws of any jurisdiction  other
            than those of England  and we do not express or imply any opinion as
            to the laws of any  jurisdiction  other  than those of  England.  We
            express no opinion as to matters of fact.

<PAGE>

3           Documents examined

            For the  purpose of this  opinion  we have  examined  the  following
            documents:

3.1         a copy of the Credit  Agreement  (including  the  Exhibits  thereto)
            bearing a signature  on behalf of OFP which is stated  therein to be
            that of one of the persons identified in the certificate referred to
            at paragraph 3.4 below as a Director of OFP;

3.2         a copy of the certificate  given by OFP pursuant to Section 3.01 (h)
            (ii) and (iii) of the Credit Agreement and having attached  thereto,
            inter alia:

3.2.1       copies  of the  certificate  of  incorporation  and  Memorandum  and
            Articles of Association of OFP, each certified as true, complete and
            up-to-date as at the date hereof by a Director of OFP; and

3.3         a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the Board of  Directors of OFP
            held on 7 November  2002,  the  resolutions  set out in such minutes
            having been certified as true, complete and still in force as at the
            date hereof by a Director of OFP; and

3.4         a further certificate addressed to us from a director of OFP, a copy
            of which is attached hereto (the "Certificate").

4           Enquiries made

            For the purpose of giving this opinion, we have:

4.1         made an oral enquiry by telephone of the Central Registry of Winding
            Up Petitions in respect of OFP on 11 November 2002; and

4.2         arranged for a review of the microfiche  relating to OFP kept at the
            Companies  Registration Office in London and obtained on 11 November
            2002.

            Except for the documents listed in paragraph 3 above and the matters
            referred to in this  paragraph 4, we have not examined any contracts
            or other  documents  entered into by or  affecting  any party to the
            Credit  Documents nor any  corporate  records of OFP and we have not
            made any other enquiries or searches concerning OFP.

5           Assumptions

            In examining  the  documents  referred to in  paragraph 3 above,  in
            making the enquiries  referred to in paragraph 4 above and in giving
            this opinion we have assumed without further enquiry:

5.1         the  genuineness  of all  signatures  and  seals on  documents,  the
            conformity  to the  originals  of all  documents  supplied  to us as
            copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents;

5.2         that the  information  disclosed  by our oral enquiry at the Central
            Registry of  Winding-up  Petitions  was then  accurate and that such
            enquiry  did not fail to disclose  any matters  which it should have
            disclosed  and which are  relevant  for the purposes of this opinion
            and since the time of such enquiry  there has been no  alteration in
            the status or  condition of OFP as  represented  by the Clerk at the
            Registry;

5.3         that the file of records  maintained at the  Companies  Registration
            Office  concerning  OFP, and  reproduced  on  microfiche  for public
            inspection, was complete, accurate and up-to-date at the time of the
            review referred to in paragraph 4.2 above and that there has been no
            alteration in the status or condition of OFP as  represented  by the
            microfiche;

<PAGE>

5.4         that OFP has not passed a voluntary  winding-up  resolution and that
            no petition  has been  presented to or order made by a court for the
            winding-up  or  dissolution   of  OFP  or  the   appointment  of  an
            administrator of OFP and that no receiver or administrator  has been
            appointed  in respect of OFP or any of its assets  which in any such
            case has not been revealed by the enquiries referred to in paragraph
            4 above;

5.5         (in relation to paragraph  6.7 only,  if relevant)  that each of the
            parties to the Credit Documents (other than OFP) is in existence and
            has full  corporate  capacity,  right,  power and authority to enter
            into and to exercise  its rights and perform its  obligations  under
            the Credit Documents;

5.6         (in relation to paragraph 6.7 only, if relevant) that under the laws
            of the  State  of New  York,  USA,  each  of  the  Credit  Documents
            constitutes  valid,  legally binding and enforceable  obligations of
            the parties thereto, including OFP;

5.7         that any copies  certified and all documents  dated earlier than the
            date of this  letter  on which  we have  expressed  reliance  remain
            accurate,  complete and in full force and effect at the date of this
            letter;

5.8         that  there  are  no  provisions  of  the  laws  of  any  applicable
            jurisdiction  outside  England  which  would be  contravened  by the
            execution and delivery of the Credit Documents and that,  insofar as
            any obligation  under the Credit Documents is to be performed in any
            jurisdiction outside England, its performance will not be illegal or
            contrary   to   public   policy  by  virtue  of  the  laws  of  that
            jurisdiction;

5.9         the accuracy of the statements contained in the Certificate; and

5.10        (as regards our opinions in  paragraphs  6.5 and 6.6 below) that all
            Advances made to OFP pursuant to the Credit  Agreement  will be made
            by persons who are (i) authorised persons (within the meaning of the
            Financial  Services  and  Markets Act 2000) who have  permission  to
            accept deposits or to effect or carry out contracts of insurance, or
            (ii)  acting in the  course of  carrying  on a  business  consisting
            wholly  or to a  significant  extent  of  lending  money,  or  (iii)
            otherwise  described in paragraph 6(1) of the Financial Services and
            Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001.

6           Opinion

            Based  upon  and  subject  to  the  foregoing,  and  subject  to the
            qualifications  and reservations  mentioned below and to any matters
            not disclosed to us, we are of the following opinion.

6.1         OFP  (i) is duly  incorporated  and  validly  existing  as a  public
            limited  company  under the laws of England and Wales;  (ii) has the
            power and  authority  to own its property and assets and to transact
            the  business in which it is engaged (as such  property,  assets and
            business  are  described  in  the  Certificate);  and  (iii)  is not
            required to be qualified as a "foreign  corporation"  in order to do
            business within England and Wales.

6.2         The  enquiry  and review  referred  to in  paragraph 4 above did not
            reveal any appointment  of, or resolution or petition to appoint,  a
            liquidator, administrator or administrative receiver of OFP, or that
            OFP is delinquent in filing its statutory annual  directors'  report
            and accounts,  or any  notification by the Registrar of Companies of
            intention to strike OFP's name off the Register of Companies.

6.3         OFP has the  corporate  power to  execute,  deliver  and perform the
            terms and provisions of each of the Credit  Documents to which it is
            expressed to be a party and to borrow under the Credit Agreement and
            has taken all necessary corporate action to authorise the execution,
            delivery and

<PAGE>

            performance by it of each of such Credit  Documents and borrowing by
            it under the Credit Agreement.

6.4         OFP has validly  executed the Credit  Agreement.  When the Notes are
            signed by one of the  Directors  of OFP,  such  Notes will have been
            validly executed by OFP.

6.5         The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  by OFP  of  the  Credit
            Documents to which it is expressed to be a party,  the compliance by
            it with the terms and  provisions  thereof and the  borrowing  by it
            under the Credit  Agreement will not (i) contravene any provision of
            any law,  statute,  rule or  regulation of England and Wales or (ii)
            violate any provision of the  memorandum and articles of association
            of OFP as currently in force.

6.6         Under   English   law,  no  order,   consent,   approval,   licence,
            authorisation or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
            with, or exemption by, any  governmental or public body or authority
            of or in England  and Wales  (except  such as have been  obtained or
            made  prior to the date  hereof) is  required  to  authorise,  or is
            required  in  connection  with,  (i)  the  execution,  delivery  and
            performance by OFP of any Credit  Document to which OFP is expressed
            to be a party,  (ii) the borrowing by OFP under the Credit Agreement
            or (iii) the enforceability of any such Credit Document against OFP.

6.7         The English courts would  recognize and give effect to the choice of
            the laws of the State of New York,  USA, as the governing law of the
            Credit Documents.

6.8         The submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New
            York,  USA, by OFP in the Credit  Documents is within the  corporate
            powers of OFP and does not contravene any law of England.

6.9         A judgment  rendered  by a court in the United  States has no direct
            operation   in  England  but  may  be   enforceable   by  action  or
            counterclaim  or be recognised by the English courts as a defence to
            an action or as conclusive of an issue in an action.  For a judgment
            rendered  by a court in the  United  States  to be  enforced  by the
            English courts it would be necessary to prove to the satisfaction of
            the English court that:-

            (i) the United States court had jurisdiction;

            (ii) the judgment is final and conclusive; and

            (iii) the judgment is for a fixed sum.

            For a defendant to such an action to have a good  defence,  it would
            be necessary for him to prove that:-

            (1)   the judgment was obtained by fraud; or

            (2)   the judgment is contrary to English public policy; or

            (3)   the judgment involves the enforcement of foreign public, penal
                  or revenue laws; or

            (4)   enforcement  would be contrary to section 5 of the  Protection
                  of Trading Interests Act 1980 (which prohibits the enforcement
                  of judgments  for multiple  damages and  judgments  based on a
                  provision or rule of law  specified by the  Secretary of State
                  as being  concerned  with the  prohibition  or  regulation  of
                  anti-competitive   arrangements   or  with  the  promotion  of
                  competition); or

            (5)   the judgment was obtained in a manner contrary to the rules of
                  natural justice; or

<PAGE>

            (6)   the judgment  involves a matter  previously  determined  by an
                  English court; or

            (7)   the United  States  action was brought in breach of  agreement
                  for settlement of disputes.

            The  question  of whether  enforcement  of a judgment is contrary to
            English public policy (see (2) above)  depends on the  circumstances
            of the  transaction  as a whole and the  subsequent  conduct  of the
            litigation in the United States and English  proceedings.  Solely on
            the  basis  of our  examination  of  the  documents  referred  to in
            paragraphs  3.1 to 3.3  (inclusive)  above,  we are not aware of any
            reason why enforcement of a judgment to pay a sum of money due under
            the Credit  Agreement  would be contrary to English public policy as
            at the date of this letter.

7           Qualifications and reservations

            Our  opinion  is  subject  to  the  following   qualifications   and
            reservations.

7.1         We express no opinion on the  effectiveness of any of the provisions
            of the Credit Documents,  since the Credit Documents are governed by
            New York law.

7.2         The obligations of OFP under the Credit Documents will be subject to
            any  laws  from  time to  time in  effect  relating  to  insolvency,
            administration,  bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganisation, moratorium
            or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and we express
            no opinion on such laws.

7.3         The enquiry at the Central Registry of Winding-up Petitions referred
            to in paragraph  4.1 above  relates only to a compulsory  winding-up
            and  is not  conclusively  capable  of  revealing  whether  or not a
            winding-up  petition in respect of a compulsory  winding-up has been
            presented since details of the petition may not have been entered on
            the  records  of  the  Central  Registry  of  Winding-up   Petitions
            immediately  or,  in the case of a  petition  presented  to a County
            Court,  may not have  been  notified  to the  Central  Registry  and
            entered on such  records at all, and the response to an enquiry only
            relates  to the  period  of six  months  prior to the date  when the
            enquiry was made.

7.4         The microfiche at the Companies  Registration  Office referred to in
            paragraph 4.2 above is not conclusively capable of revealing whether
            or not certain events have occurred,  including the  commencement of
            winding  up  or  the  making  of  an  administration  order  or  the
            appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator or
            liquidator,  as notice of these  matters  may not be filed  with the
            Registrar  of  Companies  immediately  and,  when filed,  may not be
            entered  on  the  public   microfiche   of  the   relevant   company
            immediately.

7.5         The choice of a  particular  law to govern an  agreement or document
            would  not be  recognised  or upheld  by the  English  Courts if the
            choice of law was not bona fide and legal or if there  were  reasons
            for avoiding the choice of law on the grounds of public policy.  The
            choice of a particular law would not be upheld,  for example,  if it
            was made with the  intention of evading the law of the  jurisdiction
            with which the  contract  had its most  substantial  connection  and
            which, in the absence of the chosen law, would have  invalidated the
            contract  or been  inconsistent  with  it.  We  have  not  made  any
            investigation  into the  bona  fides of the  parties  to the  Credit
            Documents;  however  we are not aware of any  reason  for an English
            Court to find that the  choice of New York law to govern  the Credit
            Documents  is not bona  fide or not  legal,  nor are we aware of any
            English  public policy that would be violated by the  enforcement of
            the Credit Documents in accordance with their respective terms.

7.6         We have not considered the particular  circumstances of any party to
            the  Credit  Documents  (save  OFP to the  extent  expressly  stated
            herein) or the effect of such particular circumstances on the Credit
            Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

<PAGE>

7.7         English  courts can give judgments in a currency other than sterling
            if,  subject  to the terms of the  contract,  that  currency  is the
            currency which most fairly expresses the plaintiff's loss.

8           Reliance

            This opinion may be relied on solely by the  addressees  and may not
