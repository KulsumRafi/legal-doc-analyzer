                    Amended and Restated Employment Agreement

                                     Between

                               Kenneth W. Freeman

                                        &

                         Quest Diagnostics Incorporated

     This AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered
into as of January 1, 2003 (the "Effective Date"), between QUEST DIAGNOSTICS
INCORPORATED (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation having its principal place
of business at One Malcolm Avenue, Teterboro, NJ 07608, and KENNETH W. FREEMAN
(the "Executive").

     WHEREAS, Executive has been heretofore employed by the Company as Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; and

     WHEREAS, the Company considers the services of the Executive to be unique
and essential to the success of the Company's business; and

     WHEREAS the Company and the Executive had previously entered into
employment agreements, the term of the last of which is to expire as of December
31, 2002, and the parties desire that the Executive continue as Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and

     WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive now wish to enter into an omnibus
amendment of the current agreement of employment on the terms and conditions set
forth herein,




<PAGE>


and which shall constitute the sole and exclusive agreement relating to the
employment of Executive by the Company.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual
covenants, terms and conditions set forth herein, and other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it
is hereby agreed between the Company and the Executive that his existing
agreement shall be amended and modified in its entirety as follows:

1.   Employment. The Company shall continue to employ the Executive in a
     full-time capacity in the position set forth in this paragraph, and the
     Executive shall continue to accept such employment upon the terms and
     conditions set forth herein. Such employment shall be in the capacity of
     Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and as a Director and Chairman of
     the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") reporting directly to
     the Board; provided that if during the Employment Term the Executive and
     Board agree in writing that as a matter of corporate governance or
     otherwise, it would be in the best interests of the Company for there to be
     a separate Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive
     may relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer and shall continue
     to serve solely as Chairman of the Board and as a Director of the Company
     for (i) one year from the date the position of Chief Executive Officer is
     relinquished ("CEO Relinquishment Date"), or (ii) until December 31, 2005,
     whichever occurs first, and the Employment Term (as hereinafter defined)
     shall be deemed to have terminated as of such date. Subject to the
     provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall use its
     best efforts to cause the Executive to be nominated as a Director of the
     Company and shall use its best efforts to cause the Executive to be elected
     to the Board and as Chairman for the duration of the Employment Term.


                                       2

2.   Employment Term. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof,
     and subject to Section 1, the term of Executive's employment under this
     Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date of this Agreement and
     continue until December 31, 2005 (the "Employment Term").

3.   Duties. During the Employment Term, the Executive shall, subject to the
     supervising powers of the Board, have those powers and duties consistent
     with his position as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman (or as Chairman
     only, as the case may be), which powers as Chief Executive Officer shall in
     all cases include, without limitation, the power of supervision and control
     over, and responsibility for, the general management and operations of the
     Company. Executive agrees to devote substantially all his working time and
     attention to the business of the Company, provided that in the event he
     becomes Chairman solely, the Executive shall devote the same full time,
     attention, diligence and care to the business and affairs of the Company as
     he did while Chief Executive Officer and Chairman prior to the CEO
     Relinquishment Date. The Executive shall not, without the prior written
     consent of the Company's Board of Directors, be directly or indirectly
     engaged in any other trade, business or occupation for compensation
     requiring his personal services during the Employment Term. Nothing in this
     Agreement shall preclude the Executive from (i) engaging in charitable and
     community activities or (ii) from managing his personal investments, or
     (iii) serving as a member of the board of directors of an unaffiliated
     company not in competition with the Company, subject, however, in each case
     mentioned in Sections 3(i) and (iii) above, to written approval by the
     Company's Board of Directors.


                                       3

4.   Place of Performance. The principal place of employment of the Executive
     shall be at the Company's principal executive offices in Teterboro, New
     Jersey; Lyndhurst, New Jersey; or New York, New York.

5.   Cash Compensation. Executive shall be compensated for services rendered
     during the Employment Term as follows:

     (a)  Base Salary. Executive shall be compensated at an annual base salary
          of no less than $1,100,000 (one million one hundred thousand dollars)
          (the base salary, at the rate in effect from time to time, is
          hereinafter referred to as the "Base Salary"). The Company's Board of
          Directors, or a committee thereof, may review and may, if appropriate,
          at its discretion, increase this annual Base Salary during the
          Employment Term consistent with Company practices and policies, to
          reflect (among other factors) increases generally granted to other
          senior executives of the Company and Executive's performance. The Base
          Salary shall be payable in equal bi-weekly installments.

     (b)  Annual Bonus. In addition to the Base Salary provided for in Section 5
          (a) above, the Company will provide annual cash bonus awards to
          Executive under its Management Incentive Plan (MIP) in accordance with
          the plan and any financial performance targets thereunder ("Annual
          Bonus"). During the Employment Term, Executive's target incentive
          opportunity under the Company's MIP will be no less than 140% of Base
          Salary as in effect at the time such target incentive opportunity is
          established, provided that in the event the Executive becomes Chairman
          solely, the Executive shall be entitled to (i) a pro rata portion of
          the Annual Bonus for that portion of the calendar year period for
          which he served as Chief Executive


                                       4




<PAGE>


          Officer (based on days served) immediately prior to the CEO
          Relinquishment Date and (ii) an additional Annual Bonus with respect
          to his service period following the CEO Relinquishment Date, provided
          (A) he is then still in the employ of the Company (x) one year from
          the CEO Relinquishment Date, or (y) December 31, 2005, whichever
          occurs first or (B) such payment is otherwise due the Executive
          pursuant to Section 11(e)(v) hereof, provided further, that if the
          Executive serves as Chairman solely for less than twelve (12) months
          because his employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by
          the Executive without Good Reason, the Executive shall have no right
          to any part of the Annual Bonus payable with respect to service after
          the CEO Relinquishment Date.

     (c)  Deferral. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Supplemental Deferred
          Compensation Plan ("SDCP"), the Executive may elect to defer from
          payments of Base Salary and Annual Bonus and any other eligible
          compensation such amounts as provided for under the SDCP.

     (d)  Incentive Award Modifications. Any equity and option awards made to
          the Executive on or prior to the Effective Date and any equity and
          option awards that may be made to the Executive during the Employment
          Term, to the extent permitted by law, shall be subject to, and shall
          benefit from, any favorable amendments or revisions to the terms and
          conditions of any of the Company's Incentive Compensation Programs
          (including, without limitation, any action resulting in extended
          exercise periods) that may be implemented on or after the Effective
          Date.

6.   Equity Awards.

     (a)  On or about the February 13, 2003 meeting of the Board, the Executive
          shall be awarded options to purchase a total of 700,000 (seven hundred
          thousand) shares of the Company's common stock (the "Option Shares")
          at an exercise price equal to the average of the quoted high and low
          price per share of such common stock on the date of the award (the
          "Option Grant"). The Option Grant shall vest as to 1/36th thereof as
          of the Effective Date and 1/36th thereof monthly on the first day of
          each and every month thereafter commencing February 1, 2003 unless
          subject to accelerated vesting under this Agreement, provided, that in
          the event the Executive becomes Chairman solely, the vesting schedule
          as set forth above shall be deemed modified and further monthly
          vesting shall cease and 12/36th of the Option Grant (or the remaining
          portion of the Option Grant which has not yet vested if less than 12
          months remain in the Employment Term) shall only vest if (A) the
          Executive is then still in the employ of the Company (x) twelve months
          from the CEO Relinquishment Date, or (y) December 31, 2005, whichever
          occurs first, or (B) the provisions of Section 11(e)(v) apply;
          provided further, that if Executive is Chairman solely for less than
          twelve (12) months because his employment is terminated by the Company
          for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason, the Executive shall
          have no right to any part of the Option Grant which accrues after the
          CEO Relinquishment Date. Except as otherwise provided for in this
          Agreement, vested Option Shares may not be exercised prior to December
          31, 2006 or after December 31, 2012, and, unless otherwise provided
          for herein, shall be governed by the terms of a stock option agreement
          approved


                                       6




<PAGE>


          by the Board, acting through its Compensation Committee consistent
          with this Agreement.

     (b)  On or about the February 13, 2003 meeting of the Board, the Executive
          shall be granted 100,000 shares of restricted stock ("Restricted
          Stock") in the Company. The Restricted Stock shall vest as to 1/36th
          thereof as of the Effective Date and 1/36th thereof monthly on the
          first day of each and every month thereafter commencing February 1,
          2003, unless subject to accelerated vesting under this Agreement;
          provided, that in the event the Executive becomes Chairman solely, the
          vesting schedule as set forth above shall be deemed modified and
          further monthly vesting shall cease and 12/36th of the Restricted
          Stock (or the remaining portion of the Restricted Stock which has not
          yet vested if less than twelve (12) months remain in the Employment
          Term) shall only vest if (A) the Executive is then still in the employ
          of the Company (x) twelve (12) months from the CEO Relinquishment
          Date, or (y) December 31, 2005, whichever occurs first or (B) the
          provisions of Section 11(e)(v) apply; provided, further, that if
          Executive is Chairman solely, for less than twelve (12) months because
          his employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the
          Executive without Good Reason, the Executive shall have no right to
          any part of the Restricted Stock which accrues after the CEO
          Relinquishment Date.

     (c)  Executive may be awarded additional compensation (such as stock
          options, shares of incentive stock, or shares of restricted stock) at
          the discretion of the Board (or any committee thereof) pursuant to the
          present or any future incentive compensation or long-term compensation
          program established for the senior


                                       7




<PAGE>


          officers of the Company (collectively the "Incentive Compensation
          Programs"), in an appropriate manner as determined in the sole
          discretion of the Board (or any committee thereof) for the position
          occupied by Executive and his performance therein relative to other
          Company senior executives and consistent with Company pay practices.
          Compensation granted under such plans will be subject to the actual
          provisions and conditions applicable to such plans.

     (d)  The Executive agrees that he shall not (i) sell, transfer or otherwise
          dispose of any Option Shares or Restricted Stock or any interest
          therein other than in compliance with the Company's 1999 Employee
          Equity Participation Program, the Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement
          between the Company and Executive relating to such Option Shares
          and/or Restricted Stock, and the Company's Policy for Purchasing and
          Selling Securities, (ii) enter into any transaction that is expected
          to result in a financial benefit arising from a decline in the value
          of the Company's stock or (iii) enter into any hedging transactions,
          including, but not limited to the use of financial derivatives, short
          sales or any other similar transactions, without the prior written
          consent of the Board of Directors, in each case with respect to
          Subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) until the Option Shares or Restricted
          Stock are vested to the fullest extent provided for under this
          Agreement, and all restrictions against exercise have expired or been
          terminated.

7.   Employee Benefits.

     (a)  General Provisions. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
          Executive shall be eligible to participate in all employee benefit and
          welfare plans offered by the Company to its senior executive officers
          (e.g., Life Insurance, Medical &


                                       8




<PAGE>


          Dental Insurance, Travel, Accident, STD & LTD, Flexible Spending
          Accounts, Regular and Supplemental AD&D, Optional/Supplemental Life
          Insurance, Profit Sharing, the 401(k) Plan and Employee Stock Purchase
          Plan) (collectively referred to as the "Benefit Plans") on a basis
          that is no less favorable to the Executive than that made available to
          other senior executive officers of the Company provided that Executive
          shall be reimbursed for the costs of his annual participation in a
          comprehensive executive health assessment at a leading medical
          institution of his choice.

     (b)  Transferred Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan.

          (i)  Executive will continue to be eligible to continue to participate
               in the "Transferred Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan" (the
               "SRP") established by the Company for certain executives of the
               Company. Under the terms of such plan, Executive (or his spouse)
               will be entitled to receive a nonqualified retirement benefit in
               accordance with the terms and provisions of the plan, as
               administered by the Board, subject to the modifications provided
               for under the terms of this Agreement.

          (ii) Notwithstanding any of the terms of the SRP to the contrary and
               in addition to any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to
               Section 11 of this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to
               receive a retirement pension benefit under this Agreement (the
               "Company Non-Qualified Benefit") as provided for below. The
               Company Non-Qualified Benefit shall, unless distributed in
               another form as provided herein, be an entitlement to a series of
               payments by the Company (such series of payments being


                                       9




<PAGE>


               referred to hereinafter as the "Normal Form of Benefit")
               consistent with the terms of the benefit provided for under the
               SRP as modified by this Agreement, such payments to commence on
               the later of (i) Executive's date of termination or (ii) the
               Executive's 55th birthday (the later of (i) and (ii), the "SRP
               Commencement Date") and shall (1) be fully equivalent in value to
               the pension benefits Executive would have received under the
               Corning non-qualified and qualified pension plans as in effect on
               December 18, 1996 (including all across-the-board plan
               improvements or benefit decreases and/or successor plans, in each
               case adopted after December 18, 1996, other than as may result
               from any bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring or
               reorganization by Corning) and applicable to the class of
               executives of which the Executive was a part while employed by
               Corning; (2) be based on Executive's combined years of service
               with the Company and Corning (but in any case, except as
               otherwise specifically provided, herein, not less than 37 years
               of service); (3) be computed without actuarial or other reduction
               that would otherwise be applicable by reason of Executive's age
               as of the SRP Commencement Date (the intent of this being to
               provide a retirement benefit that has no actuarial or other
               reduction because of its commencement on or after Executive's
               attainment of age 55, but prior to age 60, the age at which an
               unreduced retirement benefit would otherwise have been provided
               to Executive under the SRP); (4) be based on all compensation
               earned by Executive from Corning and Company through to the SRP

               Commencement Date (provided that for purposes of such
               computation, Executive's benefit eligible compensation shall be
               the average of the three highest calendar years' annual cash
               compensation (base and bonus and any other remuneration actually
               taken into account under the SRP as administered by the Company
               or Corning) received by the Executive prior to his termination of

               unpaid as of the close of such year or otherwise deferred to
               subsequent years, provided that any such unpaid or deferred
               compensation shall not again be taken into account in the year of
               receipt)("Eligible Compensation"), and provided further that in
               the case of Executive's termination as Chairman following the CEO
               Relinquishment Date, the three highest calendar years may include
               Eligible Compensation earned or otherwise payable to the
               Executive for a calendar year in which his position as Chairman
               terminates; and (5) provide the Executive with a lump sum payment
               option (the "Lump Sum Option" as hereinafter defined and subject
               to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth), as an
               alternative to the Normal Form of Benefit, payable as soon as
               practicable following (but in no event later than forty-five (45)
               days following, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise) (A)
               Executive's attainment of age 55 or (B) his termination of
               employment (whichever is later), which payment option may be
               satisfied at the election of the Executive by means of a lump sum
               cash distribution to the Executive, the distribution of an
               annuity

               contract to the Executive, or a combination of the two, where the
               total out of pocket cost to the Company of such distribution is
               equal to the amount that would be payable in the form of an
               immediate lump sum cash payment if Executive elects the Lump Sum
               Option payable in cash only (provided that in the event of a
               change of control, either under this Agreement, the SRP or any
               other applicable plan, the Executive shall be entitled to receive
               an immediate lump sum cash payment that is the equivalent in
               value to the payments that would otherwise be made to the
               Executive in the Normal Form of Benefit commencing as of the SRP
               Commencement Date, determined by using the methodology applicable
               to the determination of the Annuity Cost, as set forth below, and
               applied so as to obtain costs, determined as of the date the
               immediate lump sum cash payment is to be made, of an annuity with
               payments commencing as of the then applicable SRP Commencement
               Date); provided that if the Executive terminates his employment
               under this Agreement without Good Reason, or as a result of his
               death or the Company terminates the Executive's employment under
               this Agreement with Cause, then the pension benefits payable to
               the Executive (or his spouse) under the SRP shall be determined
               based only on actual service and Eligible Compensation through to
               the Termination Date, and the deferred vested benefit payable to
               the Executive (i) shall be computed on an accrued and unreduced
               basis and without applying the reduction factors applicable to
               deferred vested benefits under the SRP or Corning qualified plan,
               and (ii) shall be


                                       12




<PAGE>


               computed without applying the compensation and benefit limits of
               Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
               incorporated in Section 4.1(a)(7) of the SRP.

          (iii) Amounts payable to the Executive in satisfaction of the Company
               Non-Qualified Benefit shall be reduced by (i) any qualified plan
               benefits actually received or reasonably anticipated as to be
               received in the future by Executive under Corning's qualified
               plan and (ii) any non-qualified retirement benefits actually
               received or reasonably anticipated as to be received in the
               future from Corning pursuant to any non-qualified retirement plan
               of Corning (the amounts reflected in subclauses (i) and (ii)
               shall be referred to collectively as the "Corning Offset
               Payments"); provided that the value of the Corning Offset
               Payments shall be expressed as a lump sum payment the amount of
               which shall be determined by applying the same methodology and
               procedures used to determine the Annuity Cost, as set forth
               below.

          (iv) The Lump Sum Option shall be available to the Executive only if
               Executive provides written notice of his intent to elect the Lump
               Sum Option prior to the first to occur of (A) the last day of the
               calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the SRP
               Commencement Date occurs or (B) the date that is six (6) months
               prior to the SRP Commencement Date. The amount payable as an
               immediate lump sum cash payment to the Executive as settlement in
               full of his entitlement to the Lump Sum Option shall be equal to
               the Annuity Cost (as that term is defined below). For


                                       13




<PAGE>


               these purposes, the Annuity Cost shall be determined as follows:
               At least sixty (60) days prior to the SRP Commencement Date, the
               Company shall obtain and deliver to the Executive quotes on the
               price at which an annuity is available providing for payments
               commencing as of the SRP Commencement Date from seven (7)
               providers from the group of Named Annuity Providers (as defined
               below), the terms of each such annuity providing for payments to
               the Executive and his spouse commencing as of the SRP
               Commencement Date (i) that are the same as those that would
               otherwise be payable by the Company under the Company
               Non-Qualified Benefit in the Normal Form of Benefit (and without
               giving effect to any taxes owed by the Company and Executive on
               such payments, it being understood that the Executive and Company
               will be responsible for the payment of their respective
               applicable taxes upon actual payment to the Executive of the Lump
               Sum Option and (ii) based on the Corning 75% joint and
               survivorship option factors as in effect as of the Effective Date
               (the "Annuity Cost Quotes"). The Named Annuity Providers are
               Travelers, John Hancock, Met Life, Hartford, Principal, Pacific
               Life and AIG, as long as the provider maintains a better than
               "AA-" or equivalent rating (based on the providers' ability to
               pay claims) from at least two of the three (or if there are only
               two, both, or if there is only one, then the one) major credit
               rating agencies, namely Standard and Poors, Fitch Rating Services
               and Moody's Investor Services. In the event the provider does not
               maintain the previously specified credit ratings, the provider
               will


                                       14




<PAGE>


               be dropped from the group of Named Annuity Providers. In the
               event the group of Named Annuity Providers numbers less than
               seven, the Company may designate an annuity provider which meets
               the previously specified credit ratings to be added to the group
               of Named Annuity Providers so that they number seven. The Annuity
               Cost shall be the product of (x) 1.02 times (y) the price quote
               of the Named Annuity Provider that represents the median of the
               price quotes obtained from the Named Annuity Providers; provided
               that in no event shall the Annuity Cost exceed the highest price
               quote obtained from the Named Annuity Providers. In the event
               there are no Named Annuity Providers, the Executive shall
               designate an annuity provider acceptable to him and the price
               quote provided by such designee shall be the Annuity Cost.

          (v)  The lump sum payment to the Executive in satisfaction of the Lump
               Sum Option shall be subject to deduction by the Company by reason
               of the Company's tax withholding obligations under applicable
               federal, state or local statute.

     (c)  Participation in Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan. Executive
          shall be eligible to participate in the Supplemental Deferred
          Compensation Plan on a basis that is no less favorable than all other
          senior executive officers of the Company participating in the
          Transferred Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan.

     (d)  Vacation and Sick Leave. Executive shall be entitled to vacation and
          sick leave in accordance with the vacation and sick leave policies
          adopted by the Company from time to time, provided that the Executive
          shall be entitled to no less than five


                                       15




<PAGE>


          (5) weeks of paid vacation each calendar year, provided that in no
          event shall unused vacation be carried over into the next calendar
          year. Any vacation shall be at such time and for such periods as shall
          be mutually agreed upon between the Executive and the Company. The
          Executive shall be entitled to all public holidays observed by the
          Company.

8.   Applicable Taxes. There shall be deducted from any compensation payments
     made under this Agreement any federal, state, and local taxes or other
     amounts required to be withheld under applicable law.

9.   Miscellaneous Benefits. During the Employment Term, the Company shall
     provide the Executive with the following additional benefits:

     (a)  Business Travel and Expenses. Executive shall be reimbursed by the
          Company for reasonable and other business expenses, as approved by the
          Company, that are incurred and accounted for in accordance with the
          Company's normal practices and procedures for reimbursement of
          expenses.

     (b)  Executive Driver. In order to ensure the accessibility and safety of
          the Executive during the Employment Term, the Company will reimburse
          Executive for the costs of an executive driver for business purposes
          only (including transportation to and from work). The Company shall
          directly cover the costs of all other business-related transportation.

     (c)  Use of Aircraft. In order to ensure the accessibility and safety of
          the Executive during the Employment Term, the Company shall reimburse
          Executive for all costs associated with the Executive's use, for
          business purposes only, of aircraft in


                                       16




<PAGE>


          accordance with the Company's policies, whether the aircraft is being
          chartered or is Company-owned.

     (d)  Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Executive
          from being entitled to receive any additional compensation or benefits
          as approved by the Company's Board of Directors; provided, however,
          that in no event shall the Company make any loans to Executive that
          are in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as such act may be
          amended or supplemented from time to time, and the rules and
          regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated
          thereunder.

10.  Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
     Agreement to the contrary, the employment of the Executive pursuant to this
     Agreement may be terminated as follows:

     (a)  Termination by the Company for Cause. Executive may be terminated for
          "Cause" by the Company as provided below. As used herein, the term
          "Cause" shall mean (i) conviction of the Executive for a felony; or
          (ii) the commission by the Executive of fraud or theft against, or
          embezzlement from, the Company. For purposes of this section, no act
          or failure to act on Executive's part shall be considered to be reason
          for termination for Cause if done, or omitted to be done, by Executive
          in good faith and with the reasonable belief that the action or
          omission was in the best interests of the Company. Cause shall not
          exist unless and until there shall have been delivered to the
          Executive a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote
          of not less than two thirds of the entire membership of the Board at a
          meeting of the Board held for the purpose (after no


                                       17




<PAGE>


          less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Executive of such
          meeting and the purpose thereof and an opportunity for him, together
          with his counsel, to be heard before the Board at such meeting), of
          finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive was
          guilty of the conduct set forth above in this Section 10(a) and
          specifying the particulars thereof in detail. As set forth more fully
          in Section 10(e) hereof, the "Date of Termination" (which shall be no
          earlier than 30 days after delivery of the written notice to the
          Executive) shall be the date specified in the "Notice of Termination;"
          provided, however, that in the case of a termination for Cause under
          clauses 10(a)(i) and 10(a)(ii) above, the Date of Termination shall be
          the date of delivery of the Notice of Termination. Anything herein to
          the contrary notwithstanding, if, following a termination of the
          Executive's employment by the Company for Cause based upon the
          conviction of the Executive for a felony, such conviction is
          overturned in a final determination on appeal, the Executive shall be
          entitled to the payments and the economic equivalent of the benefits
          the Executive would have received if his employment had been
          terminated by the Company without Cause.

     (b)  Termination by the Company for Excessive Absenteeism. At the sole
          discretion of the Board, Executive may be terminated if the Executive
          shall have been absent from his duties with the Company on a full-time
          basis for one hundred and twenty (120) consecutive days, and if within
          thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination is given by the
          Company to the Executive, the Executive shall not have resumed the
          performance of his duties hereunder on a full-time basis. In this
          event, the Date of Termination shall be thirty (30) days after Notice
          of


                                       18




<PAGE>


          Termination is given by the Company (provided that the Executive shall
          not have returned to the full-time performance of his duties).

     (c)  Death. The Executive's employment shall terminate upon his death, and
          the date of his death shall be the Date of Termination for purposes of
          this Agreement.

     (d)  Termination by the Executive for Good Reason. The Executive may
          terminate his employment hereunder for "Good Reason," provided that
          the Executive shall have delivered a Notice of Termination within
          ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the event of Good Reason
          giving rise to such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good
          Reason" shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following
          circumstances, without the Executive's express written consent, and
          which are not remedied by the Company within thirty (30) days of
          receipt of the Executive's Notice of Termination except in the event
          of a Change in Control:

          (i)  an assignment to the Executive of any duties materially
               inconsistent with his position, duties, responsibilities, and
               status with the Company, or any material limitation of the powers
               of the Executive not consistent with the powers of the Executive
               contemplated by Section 3 hereof;

          (ii) Subject to the provisions of Section 1, any failure to use best
               efforts to cause the Executive to be elected to, the position(s)
               specified in Section 1 of this Agreement, including, without
               limitation, the failure of the Company to continue the Executive
               as Chairman following the CEO Relinquishment Date, subject to
               Section 1;

          (iii) any change of the Executive's title(s) as specified in Section 1
               of this Agreement without the Executive's consent;


                                       19




<PAGE>


          (iv) the Company's requiring the Executive without his written consent
               to be based at any office or location more than 75 miles
               commuting distance from the locations referred to in Section 4 of
               this Agreement;

          (v)  a reduction in the Executive's Base Salary or Annual Bonus target
               incentive opportunity as in effect from time to time, without his
               written consent;

          (vi) the failure of the Company to continue in effect any material
               Benefit Plan that was in effect on the Effective Date or provide
               the Executive with substantially equivalent benefits, in the
               aggregate, without his written consent;

          (vii) any other material breach by the Company of this Agreement;

          (viii) "Change in Control" as defined in Section 11(f) of this
               Agreement; or

          (ix) a failure of the Company to secure a written assumption by any
               successor company as provided for in Section 15(g) hereof.

In the event of a termination for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall be
the date specified in the Notice of Termination, and shall not be more than
thirty (30) days after the Notice of Termination.

     (e)  Other Terminations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or the
          Executive may terminate the Executive's employment under this
          Agreement at any time, subject to the provisions of Section 10(f)
          hereof. If the Executive's employment is terminated hereunder for any
          reason other than as set forth in Sections 10(a) through 10(d) hereof,
          the date on which a Notice of Termination is


                                       20




<PAGE>


          given or any later date (within 30 days) set forth in such Notice of
          Termination shall be the Date of Termination.

     (f)  Notice of Termination. Any termination of the Executive's employment
          hereunder by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated by
          written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto. For purposes
          of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice that
          shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
          relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
          circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
          Executive's employment under the provisions so indicated and a date of
          termination.

11.  Compensation upon Termination or During Disability

     (a)  Disability Period. During any period during the Employment Term that
          the Executive fails to perform his duties hereunder as a result of
          incapacity due to physical or mental illness ("Disability Period"),
          the Executive shall continue to (i) receive his full Base Salary and
          bonus otherwise payable for that period of the Employment Term

          (iii) Executive and his eligible dependents shall be entitled to
               continue participation in the Company's Benefit Plans at the same
               cost as other Company senior executives (to the extent allowable
               in accordance with the administrative provisions of those plans

               termination of the Executive without Cause by the Board or by the
               Executive for Good Reason, in which case the restriction on
               exercise of vested Option Shares shall lapse on the earlier to

                    through (iv) above and Section 11(e)(vi) below,

               (B)  if the Executive's employment is terminated subsequent to
                    six months after the CEO Relinquishment Date without Cause
                    by the Board or by the Executive for Good Reason, he shall
                    be entitled to: (w) payment of unpaid Base Salary from the
                    Chairman Termination Date through (i) the first anniversary
                    of the CEO Relinquishment Date or (ii) until December 31,
                    2005, whichever occurs first; (x) payment of the Annual
                    Bonus that he would have been entitled to had he continued
                    to serve as the Chairman from the Chairman Termination Date
                    through (i) the first anniversary of the CEO Relinquishment
                    Date or (ii) until December 31, 2005, whichever occurs
                    first, payable in accordance with the Company's normal

                    December 31, 2005, whichever occurs first; and (z) all of
                    the accelerated vesting, lifting of exercise period
                    restrictions and other lapsing of restrictions on restricted
                    stock and stock options and other benefits described in
                    Section 11(e)(iv) except that such benefits shall not apply
                    to that portion of the Option Shares and


                                       26




<PAGE>


                    Restricted Stock that would not otherwise have vested
                    through (i) the first anniversary of the CEO Relinquishment
                    Date or (ii) until December 31, 2005, whichever occurs
                    first, assuming that the Executive had continued to serve as
                    Chairman throughout such period.

          (vi) In the event that the Executive receives any payment or benefit
               (including but not limited to the payments or benefits pursuant
               to Section 11 of this Agreement (a "Payment") that is subject to
               the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the
               Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
               Company shall pay to the Executive, as soon thereafter as
               practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment") such
               that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of
               any Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state,
               and local income tax and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up
               Payment, shall be equal to the Payment. The determination of
               whether an Excise Tax is due in respect to any payment or
               benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the
               Gross-Up Payment shall be made by an independent auditor (the
               "Auditor") jointly selected by the Company and the Executive and
               paid by the Company. If the Executive and the Company cannot
               agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and
               the Company shall each select one nationally recognized
               accounting firm and those two firms shall jointly select one
               nationally recognized accounting firm to serve as the Auditor.
               Notwithstanding the Payment, (i) any other payments or


                                       27




<PAGE>


               benefits received or to be received by the Executive in
               connection with a Change in Control or the Executive's
               termination of employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this
               Agreement or any other plan, arrangement, or agreement with the
               Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control
               or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall
               be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
               280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments"
               within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code shall be treated
               as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of the tax
               counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits
               (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or
               are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the
               Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the
               highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which
               the Gross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at
               the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality
               of the Executive's residence on the Date of Termination, net of
               the maximum reduction in federal income tax which could be
               obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the
               event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less
               than the amount used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the
               Executive or the Company, as the case may be, shall pay to the
               other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax or such income
               tax.

     (f)  Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, "Change in Control"
          of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred if:


                                       28




<PAGE>


          (i)  the Company's shareholders approve any transaction that is
               contemplated to result in a "Qualifying Merger or Consolidation,"
               sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's
               assets or a plan of partial or complete liquidation, share
               exchange, amalgamation, recapitalization or similar transaction
               and such transaction is completed substantially in accordance
               with the terms approved by the shareholders; provided that
               notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in this subsection
               (f)(i), no such merger, consolidation or sale shall be deemed to
               constitute a "Change in Control" if such transaction or series of
               transactions required the Executive to be identified in any
               United States securities law filing as a person or a member of
               any group acquiring , holding or disposing of beneficial
               ownership of the Company's securities and/or assets and effecting
               a "Change in Control" as defined in this subclause (f)(i); or

          (ii) during any period of not more than two (2) consecutive years (not
               including any period prior to the date of this Agreement),
               individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the
               Board of Directors of the Company, and any new director (other
               than a director designated by a "person" (as hereinabove defined)
               who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a
               transaction described in clause (i), (iii) or (iv) of this
               Section) whose election was approved by Executive or whose
               election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's
               stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the
               directors then still in office who either were directors at the
               beginning of the period or whose


                                       29

               (including approval by Executive), cease for any reason to
               constitute at least a majority thereof; or

          (iii) the acquisition of any third-party of stock constituting at
               least 51% of all outstanding shares of stock of the Company and
               that is not part of a Qualifying Merger or Consolidation (a
               "Share Acquisition") and subsequent to such acquisition either
               (i) the Company is no longer a public company for U.S. securities
               law purposes, or (ii) there is a material diminution of the
               Executive's position or any other breach of this Agreement by the
               Company or event giving rise to a Good Reason termination by the
               Executive.

          (iv) For purposes of this Section (f), "Qualifying Merger or
               Consolidation" shall mean any of the following: (1) any merger or
               consolidation between the Company and any entity in which the
               surviving entity (whether or not the Company) is not a publicly
               traded entity and the Executive is not CEO and Chairman of the
               publicly traded parent (if any) of the surviving entity, or (2)
               any merger or consolidation between the Company and any entity in

               surviving entity, in each case so long as the Executive was CEO
               and Chairman immediately prior to the merger or consolidation

               that if under this Agreement the Executive is no longer serving
               as the CEO immediately prior to such


                                       30

               merger or consolidation there must also have occurred following
               the consummation of such transaction, or within six (6) months
               thereafter, a material diminution of the Executive's position or
               any other breach of this Agreement by the Company or event giving
               rise to a Good Reason termination by the Executive.

          period of (1) one year from the date of the Executive's termination of
          employment for any reason, the Executive will not provide services, in
          any capacity, whether as an employee, consultant, independent

          later than 30 calendar days) as to whether, in the exercise of its
          reasonable judgment, the Company views any proposed activity
          contemplated by the Executive as constituting a competing "Business,"
          provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Executive from, after

          than three percent (3%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a
          corporation that is publicly traded.

               Laboratory Medical Information Services, (C) clinical laboratory

               Company planned, provided or discussed during the (1) one year
               period prior to the termination of Executive's employment.

          (ii) "Clinical Laboratory Medical Information Services" shall mean
               medical information services which contain a substantial clinical
               laboratory data component.

          (iii) "Indirectly solicit" shall include, but are not to be limited

               allowing the use of Executive's name by any company (or any
               employees of any other company) other than the Company, in the
               solicitation of the Business of Company's customers.

     (e)  Expedited Arbitration Applicable to Section 12. In the event there is
          a dispute under this Section, the parties agree to hold an expedited
          hearing in the City of New York, New York, before an arbitrator under
          American Arbitration Association Rules.

     (f)  Exclusive Property. Executive confirms that all confidential
          information is and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company.
          All business records, papers and documents kept or made by Executive
          relating to the business of the Company, its affiliates and
          subsidiaries (other than his personal records) shall be and remain the
          property of the Company. Upon the termination of his employment with
          the Company or upon the request of the Company at any time, Executive
          shall promptly deliver to the Company, and shall not without the
          consent of the Board retain copies of, any written materials not
          previously made available to the public, or records and documents made
          by Executive in his possession concerning the business or affairs of
          the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries (other than his
          personal records); provided, however, that subsequent to any such
          termination, the Company shall provide Executive with copies (the cost
          of which shall be borne by Executive) of any documents that are
          requested by Executive and that Executive has determined in good faith
          are (i) required to establish a defense to a claim that Executive has
          not complied with his


                                       33




<PAGE>


          duties hereunder or (ii) necessary to Executive in order to comply
          with applicable law.

     (g)  Remedies.

          (i)  Injunctive Relief. Without intending to limit the remedies
               available to the Company, Executive acknowledges that a breach of
               any of the covenants contained in this Section 12 may result in
               material irreparable injury to the Company or its affiliates or
               subsidiaries for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that
               it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
               precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat
               thereof, the Company shall be entitled to obtain a temporary
               restraining order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction
               restraining Executive from engaging in activities prohibited by
               this Section 12 or such other relief as may be required to
               specifically enforce any of the covenants in this Section 12.
               Executive hereby agrees that the Company shall not be required to
               post any bond or other security in connection with any such
               equitable relief. Without intending to limit the remedies
               available to Executive, Executive shall be entitled to seek
               specific performance of the Company's obligations under this
               Agreement.

          (ii) Additional Remedy. In the event of an arbitrator's determination
               that Executive has breached any of the covenants contained in
               this Section 12 during his employment or within one year after
               termination thereof for any reason, then (1) all of Executive's
               outstanding stock options shall immediately terminate as of the
               date of the breach and (2) any gains


                                       34




<PAGE>


          realized by Executive from exercising all or a portion of any stock
          options within three months prior to his termination of employment or
          anytime after his termination of employment, shall be paid by
          Executive to the Company. The amount of the realized gains shall be
          the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of
          the stock on the day each option is exercised and the Executive agrees
          to pay immediately said amounts to the Company. The Company shall
          cooperate with the Executive in filing amended tax returns required as
          a result of the exercise by the Company of its rights pursuant to this
          subclause (ii). Executive agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance
          to the Company. Executive may be released from his obligations
          hereunder only if the Board (or its duly appointed agent) determines
          in its sole discretion that such action is in the best interests of
          the Company.

13.  Arbitration. In the event of any difference of opinion or dispute between
     the Executive and the Company with respect to the construction or
     interpretation of this Agreement or the alleged breach thereof, which
     cannot be settled amicably by agreement of the parties, then such dispute
     shall be submitted to and determined by arbitration by a single arbiter in
     the city of New York, New York in accordance with the rules then in effect
     of the Commercial Arbitration Panel of the American Arbitration Association
     (the "AAA"), and judgment upon the award rendered shall be final, binding
     and conclusive upon the parties and may be entered in the highest court,
     state or federal, having jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration shall
     be borne as determined by the arbitrator; provided, however, that the
     reasonable expenses of the prevailing party, as determined by the
     arbitrator (including,


                                       35




<PAGE>


     without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the AAA and the
     arbitrator, fees and expenses payable to witnesses, including expert
     witnesses, reasonable fees and expenses payable to attorneys and other
     professionals, reasonable expenses of the prevailing party in attending the
     hearing, reasonable costs in connection with obtaining and presenting
     evidence and reasonable costs of the transcription of the proceedings), as
     determined by the arbitrator, shall be reimbursed to the prevailing party
     by the other party.

14.  Confidentiality. During the Employment Term, and except as otherwise
     required by law, the Executive shall not disclose or make accessible to any
     business, person or entity, or make use of (other than in the course of the
     business of the Company) any trade secrets, proprietary knowledge or
     confidential information, which he shall have obtained during his
     employment by the Company and which shall not be generally known to or
     recognized by the general public. All information regarding or relating to
     any aspect of either the Company's business, including but not limited to
     that relating to existing or contemplated business plans, activities or
     procedures, current or prospective clients, current or prospective
     contracts or other business arrangements, current or prospective products,
     facilities and methods, manuals, intellectual property, price lists,
     financial information (including the revenues, costs, or profits associated
     with any of the Company's products or services), or any other information
     acquired because of the Executive's employment by the Company, shall be
     conclusively presumed to be confidential; provided, however, that
     Confidential Information shall not include any information known generally
     to the public (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by or at
     the direction of the Executive) or any specific information or type of
     information generally not considered information disclosed by the Company
     or any


                                       36




<PAGE>


     officer thereof to a third party without restrictions on the disclosure of
     such information. The Executive's obligations under this Section 14 shall
     be in addition to any other confidentiality or nondisclosure obligations of
     the Executive of the Company at law or under any other agreements.

15.  Other Matters.

     (a)  Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
          between the Company and the Executive relating to the subject matter
          hereof, and supersedes any previous agreements, commitments and
          understandings, written or oral, with respect to the matters provided
          herein. As used in this Agreement, terms such as "herein," "hereof,"
          "hereto" and similar language shall be construed to refer to this
          entire instrument and not merely the paragraph or sentence in which
          they appear, unless so limited by express language.

     (b)  Assignment. Except as set forth below, this Agreement and the rights
          and obligations contained herein shall not be assignable or otherwise
          transferable by either party to this Agreement without the prior
          written consent of the other party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
          the foregoing, any amounts owing to the Executive upon his death shall
          inure to the benefit of his heirs, legatees, personal representatives,
          executor or administrator.

     (c)  Notices. Any and all notices provided for under this Agreement shall
          be in writing and hand delivered or sent by first class registered or
          certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed
          to the Executive at his residence or to the Company at its usual place
          of business, and all such notices


                                       37




<PAGE>


          shall be deemed effective at the time of delivery or at the time
          delivery is refused by the addressee upon presentation.

     (d)  Amendment/Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be amended,
          waived, modified, extended or discharged unless such amendment,
          waiver, extension or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by both
          the Company and the Executive.

     (e)  Applicable Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
          parties hereunder shall be construed, interpreted, and enforced in
          accordance with the laws of the State of New York (applicable to
          contracts to be performed wholly within such State).

     (f)  Severability. The Executive hereby expressly agrees that all of the
          covenants in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary in order to
          protect the Company and its business. If any provision or any part of
          any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable
          under applicable law, such part shall be ineffective only to the
          extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and shall not affect in
          any way the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of
          this Agreement, or the remaining parts of such provision.

     (g)  Successor in Interest. In the event the Company merges or consolidates
          with or into any other corporation or corporations, or sells or
          otherwise transfers substantially all of its assets to another
          corporation or other entity, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
          binding upon and inure to the benefit of the entity surviving or
          resulting from the merger or consolidation or to which the assets are
          sold or transferred and, prior to the consummation of any such event,
          the Company shall obtain the express written assumption of this
          Agreement by the


                                       38




<PAGE>


          other entity (other than in the case of a merger after which the
          Company is the surviving entity). All references herein to the Company
          refer with equal force and effect to any corporate or other successor
          of the entity that acquires directly or indirectly by merger,
          consolidation, purchase or otherwise, all or substantially all of the
          assets of the Company.

     (h)  No Mitigation. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate amounts
          payable pursuant to Section 11 hereof by seeking other employment or
          otherwise.

16.  Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the full
     extent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all expenses,
     costs, liabilities and legal fees (collectively, "Damages") that the
     Executive may incur in the discharge of all his duties hereunder,
     including, without limitation, the right to be paid in advance by the
     Company for his expenses in defending a civil or criminal action,
     proceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition thereof. During
     the time that Executive serves as an officer or Director of the Company,
     the Executive shall be insured under the Company's Directors' and Officers'
     Liability Insurance Policy as in effect from time to time. Notwithstanding
     any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any termination of
     the Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the
     continuing operation of this Section 16.

17.  Authority. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has
     been duly authorized by the Company and this Agreement represents the
     valid, legal and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
     Company according to its terms.
