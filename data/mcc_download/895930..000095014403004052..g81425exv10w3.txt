                               FIRST AMENDMENT TO
                 AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT


         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
(this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of June 22, 2001 by and
among AMSURG CORP., a Tennessee corporation (the "Borrower"), the several banks
and other financial institutions from time to time party hereto (the "Lenders"),
and SUNTRUST BANK, in its capacity as Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the
"Administrative Agent" or "Agent").

                                    RECITALS:

         1.       The Borrower and the Lenders entered into an Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated May 5, 2000 (the "Agreement).

         2.       The Borrower and Lender desire to amend the Agreement as
provided herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, the Borrower and the Lender agree as follows:

         1.       Section 7.13(b)(iii) shall hereby be amended and restated as
follows:

                           (iii)    the aggregate number of Acquisitions, in any
                  rolling twelve (12) month period since the Closing Date, does
                  not exceed twelve (12); provided, however, that if the sum of
                  the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures of all Lenders plus
                  the pro forma cost of any proposed Acquisition is less than
                  $50,000,000, then the limitations set forth in this Section
                  7.13(b)(iii) shall not apply;

         2.       The Agreement is not amended in any other respect

         3.       The Borrower represents and warrants that no Event of Default
has occurred under the Agreement.

         4.       The Borrower agrees that its obligations are valid and
binding, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to no
defense, counterclaim, or objection.

         5.       This agreement may be executed in any number of separate
counterparts (including by telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
