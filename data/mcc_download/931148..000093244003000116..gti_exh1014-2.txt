                           RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT
                               (Standard Version)

         Restricted Stock Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of______, ____
(the "Grant Date"), between GrafTech International Ltd. (the "Company") and
____________ (the "Participant").

                                   BACKGROUND

         Reference is made to the GrafTech International Ltd. Management Stock
Incentive Plan, 1995 Equity Incentive Plan or 1996 Mid-Management Equity
Incentive Plan, in each case as amended and restated effective through the Grant
Date. As used herein, the term "Plan" means whichever of those Plans is
specified below. A copy of the Plan has been made available to the Participant
and the terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference.

         The Plan allows the Company to provide rewards and incentives to
certain management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries by, among other
things, granting them shares of Common Stock. The Board or the Committee has
determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and its
stockholders to grant the Restricted Shares to the Participant under the Plan.

         In consideration of the covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

         Whenever capitalized terms are used in this Agreement, they shall have
the meanings set forth in this Agreement or, if not defined in this Agreement,
as set forth in the written employment agreement between the Participant and the
Company or a Subsidiary or, if not defined in this Agreement and if not defined
in such an agreement or there is no such agreement, as set forth in the Plan.

         "Cause" shall mean:

Retirement);

              (ii) breach by the Participant of his or her confidentiality
obligations owed to the Company or any Subsidiary;

              (iii) willful engagement by the Participant in conduct which is
demonstrably injurious to the Company or any Subsidiary (including a breach by
the Participant of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation obligations
owed to the Company or any Subsidiary); or

              (iv) conviction or plea of nolo contendere by the Participant to a
felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.

         "Disability" shall mean the inability of the Participant to perform in

Company or any Subsidiary by reason of a physical or mental disability or
infirmity which inability is reasonably expected to be permanent and has
continued:

              (i) for a period of ____ consecutive months; or

              (ii) such shorter period as the Company may determine.

              (ii) if not eligible to participate in the UCAR Carbon Retirement
Plan (or a successor plan) or if the UCAR Carbon Retirement Plan (or a successor
plan) is not then in effect or shall have been changed in a manner which makes
it materially more onerous to become eligible to receive such a benefit than it
is on the Grant Date, at any time after attaining age __ with at least __ years
of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries or after attaining age __ or
after attaining that age where the sum of the Participant's age and years of
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries equals or exceeds __.

                                   ARTICLE II

profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

forfeited pursuant to Section 3.4; and

         3.2 Accelerated Vesting. If not sooner vested and unless previously
forfeited pursuant to Section 3.4, all Restricted Shares shall vest (regardless

Company and its Subsidiaries without Cause (including termination due to
reduction in force or lay-off)) upon the earliest to occur of:

              (i) a Change in Control;

              (ii) the death of the Participant;

Board or the

<PAGE>

Committee, all unvested Restricted Shares shall cease to vest and shall be
forfeited upon the earliest to occur of:

Participant's employment by the Company or any Subsidiary for Cause; or

              (ii) the date of the Participant's resignation from employment
with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason (including resignation for
good reason) other than Retirement.

purposes hereof, except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.4(i), the date of
resignation or termination of employment means the last date of actual

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     PROCEDURES AFFECTING RESTRICTED SHARES

         4.1 Reversion to Treasury. All Restricted Shares which are forfeited

by the Company, the Participant or any other person) revert to the Company and
shall thereupon constitute treasury shares subject to the Plan.

         4.2 Delivery of Restricted Shares.

              (i) The Restricted Shares will be delivered to the Participant in
book entry form by causing the Restricted Shares to be credited to the
Participant's account at such brokerage firm as may be designated from time to
time by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan (the "Broker").

              (ii) The Restricted Shares will be delivered on or before
_________, ____; provided, however, that if any of the Restricted Shares vest
before such date, such Restricted Shares shall be delivered reasonably promptly
thereafter (as determined by the Company).

              (iii) When Restricted Shares are delivered in book entry form,
such delivery as well as all subsequent transfers and other matters relating to
the Restricted Shares will be subject, in addition to all other provisions
hereof, to the rules and requirements imposed by the Broker and such
administrative rules and requirements as may be imposed by the Company. Prior to
vesting, the Restricted Shares will be subject to stop transfer instructions
given by the Company to the Broker and the transfer agent for the Common Stock.
Upon vesting of any Restricted Shares, such stop transfer instructions will be
terminated (except to the extent that any Restricted Shares may be sold pursuant
to Section 4.4 to satisfy Withholding Requirements). Upon forfeiture of any
Restricted Shares, the Broker and such transfer agent will be instructed to
debit such Restricted Shares from such account and return them to the Company.

              (iv) Each book entry relating to Restricted Shares may include

Agreement, applicable securities, tax or other laws or applicable rules of any
securities exchange or market.

         4.3 Transfer of Restricted Shares.

              (i) Unvested Restricted Shares cannot be transferred or pledged to
any individual or entity or for any purpose without the prior written consent of
the Company. Any attempt to effect a transfer or pledge of unvested Restricted
Shares without such consent shall be null and void.

              (ii) To the extent necessary (as determined by the Company) to
permit resale by the Participant of vested Restricted Shares, the Company will
use reasonable efforts to register the resale of such Restricted Shares under
the Securities Act of 1933, so long as the Company is permitted to do so on Form
S-3 or S-8 or a similar abbreviated form and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Plan and such other reasonable or customary terms and
conditions as be may be imposed by the Company (including those relating to
indemnification by the Participant for errors or omissions from information
provided by the Participant).

         4.4  Withholding of Taxes.

              (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall withhold or deduct from
any or all payments or amounts due to or held for the Participant, whether due
from the Company or any Subsidiary or held in the Participant's account at the
Broker, an amount (the "Withholding Amount") equal to all taxes (including
unemployment (including FUTA), social security and medical (including FICA), and
other governmental charges of any kind as well as income and other taxes)
required to be withheld or deducted with respect to any and all taxable income
and other amounts attributable to the Restricted Shares (the "Withholding
Requirement").

              (ii) The Withholding Amount shall be determined by the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

              (iii) The timing of withholding or deduction from such payments or
amounts shall be determined by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that, if such taxes are required to be paid to a tax or other
governmental authority before such withholding or deduction is made, then the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall pay such taxes when due as agent for the
Participant and shall be entitled to reimbursement therefore from the
Withholding Amount.

              (iv) The Company may restrict transfer of any or all of the vested
Restricted Shares until all Withholding Requirements are satisfied.

              (v) Unless the Participant has made or makes a timely election
pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Participant
authorizes the Company and the Broker to:



                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (A) sell, on his or her behalf and for his or her account,
from time to time and at any time as the Company or the Broker may deem
necessary, appropriate, convenient or expedient to satisfy each Withholding
Requirement or to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect thereof,
a sufficient number of Restricted Shares (as determined by the Company or the
Broker) so that the net proceeds from such sale equal or exceed the applicable
Withholding Amount; and

                  (B) use the net proceeds to satisfy such Withholding
Requirement (with any excess net proceeds to be paid to or deposited in an
account of the Participant).

              (vi) If the Participant has made or makes an election pursuant to
Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, he or she shall immediately
upon demand by the Company make a cash payment to the Company equal to any
Withholding Amount in respect thereof.

              (vii) In connection with any sale of Restricted Shares pursuant to
this Section 4.4, the Participant agrees that:

                  (A) such sale may be aggregated with sales of restricted stock
granted to other participants under the Plan or other equity incentive plans;

                  (B) such aggregated sales may be made from time to time in one
or more installments at any time;

                  (C) such aggregated sales may be made over time as the Company
or the Broker may deem necessary, appropriate, convenient or expedient with a
view toward avoidance or minimization of disruption of the market for the Common
Stock, administrative convenience, minimization of costs and expenses or other
factors; and

                  (D) the net proceeds from such aggregated sales and the sale
prices of the shares sold may be allocated among such Restricted Shares and
other shares of restricted stock and the Participant and such other participants
as the Company or the Broker may deem reasonable.

              (viii) The Participant understands that:

                   (A) different Withholding Requirements may arise at different
times based on time of delivery or vesting of Restricted Shares, tax elections
or other factors;

                   (B) different Withholding Requirements may be based on
different values attributable to the Restricted Shares at such times or
otherwise based on applicable tax laws, changes in the financial performance or
prospects of the Company, changes in market or economic conditions or other
factors;

                   (C) it may not be practicable or permissible to sell
Restricted Shares to satisfy each Withholding Requirement at the time due
because of rules and requirements of the Broker, administrative rules and
requirements of the Company, restrictions under the Company's insider trading
and other compliance policies and procedures, potential



                                       6
<PAGE>

liability for short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, applicable securities, tax or other laws, applicable rules of any
securities exchange or market, or other factors; and

                   (D) as a result, Restricted Shares may be sold at times and
values that differ, potentially significantly, from those applicable to such
Withholding Requirement and that such differences can result in gains or losses,
potentially significant, relative to those values and capital gains and losses
for tax purposes in addition to the taxes described in Section 4.4(i).

              (ix) The Participant hereby appoints each officer and assistant
officer of the Company to be the Participant's true and lawful agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and re-substitution (each, an
"attorney-in-fact" and, together, the "attorneys-in-fact"), to take, cause to be
taken and authorize the taking of any and all actions (including the giving of
instructions to sell and the approval of confirmations), to incur, cause to be
incurred and authorize the incurrence of any and all costs and expenses
(including brokerage commissions), to undertake, cause to be undertaken and
authorize the undertaking of any and all obligations and to execute,
acknowledge, file, publish and deliver, cause to be executed, acknowledged,
filed, published and delivered and authorize the execution, acknowledgement,
filing, publication and delivery of any and all agreements, instruments and
documents (including stock powers, account agreements and related documents, and
wire transfer instructions) which such attorney-in-fact may deem necessary,
appropriate, convenient or expedient to sell Restricted Shares, on behalf and
for the account of the Participant, to generate net proceeds to satisfy any and
all Withholding Requirements, to use net proceeds in satisfaction thereof and to
otherwise give effect to the intent and purposes of this Section 4.4, all in the
name of the Participant, such attorney-in-fact, the Company or any Subsidiary
and all at such times, in such manners, in such amounts, on such exchanges or
markets, on such terms, through such brokers, dealers and accounts and otherwise
as such attorney-in-fact may determine in his or her sole and absolute
discretion, and hereby grants to each attorney-in-fact the full power and
authority to do any and all things necessary, convenient, expedient or
appropriate in connection therewith. This power of attorney shall not be
affected in any manner by reason of the execution, at any time, of other powers
of attorney by the Participant in favor of persons other than the
attorneys-in-fact named herein and shall not be affected by the subsequent
death, disability or incompetence of the Participant. This power of attorney is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall remain in effect until all
Withholding Requirements have been fully and unconditionally satisfied. All
persons dealing with any of the attorneys-in-fact named herein may assume that
this power of attorney has not been revoked and may be relied upon.

              (x) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Company, any Subsidiary, the Broker nor any of their respective affiliates,
control persons, directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents shall
have any liability or obligation for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of
any kind or under any theory arising out of or in connection with any action
taken or omitted to be taken or any delay in taking any action pursuant to or
contemplated by this Section 4.4 (including the determination of any Withholding
Amount or the time when any Withholding Requirement is required to be satisfied
or any sale of or delay in selling or failure to sell or the price, terms or
conditions of sale of any or all of the Restricted Shares), including any
liability for any claim that the Participant could have made more or lost less
in connection therewith or for any capital gain or


                                       7
<PAGE>

loss due to the difference in time between the triggering of a Withholding
Requirement and the resale of Restricted Shares in respect thereof or for
violations of insider trading or other laws or for incurrence of liability for
short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines by final
and nonappealable judgment that any such losses, damages, costs or expenses
resulted from actions taken or omitted to be taken by them in bad faith or from
their gross negligence or willful misconduct. References in this Section 4.4 to
"selling" and correlative terms include all activities related thereto,
including placement and execution of sell orders, selection of brokers and
dealers, delivery of share certificates, receipt of proceeds and payment of fees
and commissions.

              (xi) The provisions hereof regarding sale of Restricted Shares to
satisfy Withholding Requirements are also intended to constitute a trading plan
within the meaning of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Act of 1933.

              (xii) The Participant accepts this Agreement and the Restricted
Shares subject to, and agrees to assume, the limitations, risks and
responsibilities inherent with respect to the Restricted Shares, including those
mentioned in this Agreement.
