liabilities) as they mature; (ii)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s assets do not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business for the current fiscal year
as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its capital needs
taking into account the particular capital requirements of the business
conducted by the Company, and projected capital requirements and capital
availability thereof; and (iii)&nbsp;the current cash flow of the Company, together
with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to liquidate all of its
assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be
sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt when such amounts
are required to be paid. The Company does not intend to incur debts beyond its
ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt).

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><U>Preemptive Rights</U>. The Company hereby grants to the Purchase a
preemptive right to purchase all or any part of the Purchaser&#146;s Pro Rata Share
(as defined below) of any New Securities (as defined below) that the Company
may, from time to time, propose to issue or sell. Such preemptive right shall
be subject to the following provisions of this Section&nbsp;4.1.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>(a)<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><U>Procedure</U>. In the event that the Company proposes to undertake
an issuance of New Securities, the Company shall give the Purchaser written
notice of its intention, describing the type of New Securities and the price
and other terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to issue such
New Securities. The Purchaser shall have 20&nbsp;days from the date any such notice
is given to agree, by written notice to the Company, to purchase all or any
part of its pro rata share of such New Securities at the price and upon the
other terms and conditions specified in the Company&#146;s notice by giving written
notice to the Company of its intention to exercise its preemptive right and
stating therein the number of New Securities, up to its pro rata share, to be
purchased. The failure of the Purchaser to notify the Company within such
20-day period shall constitute an election by the Purchaser not to exercise its
preemptive right with respect to such issuance. If the Purchaser has elected
to exercise all or any part of its preemptive right hereunder, the Company
shall, within three days of the date of issuance of the New Securities, issue
to the Purchaser such number of New Securities as the Purchaser requested in
its notice to the Company and, simultaneously therewith, the Purchaser shall
pay to the Company the purchase price therefor in immediately available funds
by bank check or wire transfer to an account designated in writing by the
Company.
