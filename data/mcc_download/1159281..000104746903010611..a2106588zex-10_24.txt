and if such default is not made good prior to the due date of the next such
installment, the entire principal sum and accrued interest shall at once become

         All parties to this note, whether principal, surety, guarantor, or

                             CORPORATION ("LENDER")



                              ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS



         NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS NOTE, IT IS
AGREED THAT THE EXECUTION OF THIS NOTE SHALL IMPOSE NO PERSONAL LIABILITY ON THE
MAKER HEREOF FOR PAYMENT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED HEREBY AND IN THE EVENT
OF A DEFAULT, THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO THE PROPERTY
DESCRIBED IN THE MORTGAGE AND TO THE RENTS, ISSUES AND PROFITS THEREFORE IN
SATISFACTION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED HEREBY AND WILL NOT SEEK OR OBTAIN
ANY DEFICIENCY OR PERSONAL JUDGMENT AGAINST THE MAKER HEREOF EXCEPT SUCH
JUDGMENT OR DECREE AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO FORECLOSE AND BAR ITS INTEREST IN THE
ROPERTY AND ALL OTHER PROPERTY MORTGAGED, PLEDGED, CONVEYED OR ASSIGNED TO
SECURE PAYMENT OF THIS NOTE EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN THE DEED OF TRUST OF EVEN DATE
GIVEN TO SECURE THIS INDEBTEDNESS.

         Maker represents and warrants that the loan evidenced by this Deed of
Trust Note was made and transacted solely for the investment within the meaning
of said Commercial Law Article, Title 12, Section 101 and 103(e) of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, (1990 Repl. Vol.).

         Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, Maker shall
not have the right to prepay the indebtedness evidenced hereby in part or in
whole at any time to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of final
endorsement of this Deed of Trust Note by the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development ("HUD") (the "Fifth Anniversary"). Maker shall have the right, at
any time from and after the Fifth Anniversary, to prepay the indebtedness
evidenced hereby in whole, but not in part, on the first day of any month prior
to maturity upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the holder
of this Deed of Trust Note accompanied by the following prepayment premiums:
Sixth Year - 5% of the unpaid principal balance: Seventh Year - 3% of the unpaid
principal balance: Eighth Year - 1% of the unpaid principal balance: Ninth Year

         Notwithstanding any prepayment prohibition imposed and/or penalty
required by this Note with respect to prepayments made prior to the Eight
Anniversary of the date of the final endorsement of this Note, the indebtedness
may be prepaid in part or in full without the consent of the mortgagee and
without prepayment penalty of HUD determines that prepayment will avoid a
mortgage insurance claim and is therefore in the best interest of the Federal
Government.

         In the event any installment or part of any installment due hereunder
becomes delinquent for more than fifteen (15) days, there shall be due at the
option of the holder hereof, in addition to other sums then due hereunder, a sum
equal to two percent (2%) of the amount of principal and interest so delinquent.
