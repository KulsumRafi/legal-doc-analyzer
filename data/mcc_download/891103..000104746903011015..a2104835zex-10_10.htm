<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;TANDEM
SARS. Tandem SARs shall terminate on the same date as the related ISO or NSO. A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only if the Fair Market Value of a share of Common
Stock on the date of surrender exceeds either the Option Price for the related ISO or the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Option Date, if related to an NSO, and then shall be exercisable
to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related ISO or NSO is exercisable. A Tandem SAR shall entitle the Participant to whom it is granted the right to elect, so long as such Tandem SAR is
exercisable and subject to such limitations as the Committee shall have imposed, to surrender any then exercisable portion of his related ISO or NSO, in whole or in part, and receive from the Company
in exchange, without any payment of cash (except for applicable employee withholding taxes), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal

Common Stock on the Option Date, if such SAR is related to an NSO and (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such ISO or NSO or portion thereof which is surrendered. Any ISO or

the rules and regulations issued thereunder, or in order to obtain any exemption therefrom. If a Participant subject to Section&nbsp;16(a) or Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act exercises a SAR

to the Committee, stating the number of shares to which he intends to exercise the Option. The Company will issue the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised upon payment in full of the
Option Price. The Option Price may be paid in (i)&nbsp;cash, (ii)&nbsp;shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined on the date of delivery, equal to the Option
Price, or (iii)&nbsp;by delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay for all Common Stock acquired through
such exercise and any tax withholding obligations resulting from such exercise. The Option Price may be paid in shares of Common Stock which were received by the Participant upon the exercise of one
or more Options. The Option Price may be paid in shares of Common Stock which were received by the Participant as an award of Restricted Stock under the Plan. The Option Price may be paid by surrender
of Tandem SARs equal to the Option Price. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;VESTING.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant may not exercise an Option or surrender a SAR or Phantom Stock until it has become vested. The portion of an Option, SAR or Phantom Stock award that
is vested depends upon the period that has elapsed since the Option Date. Unless the Committee establishes a different vesting schedule at the time when an Option is granted or the Restricted Stock,
SAR or Phantom Stock is awarded, all Options granted under this Plan, Restricted Stock, SARs, and Phantom Stock awarded under this Plan shall become 25% vested after 12&nbsp;months from the Option
Date, and shall vest monthly pro rata over a period of 36&nbsp;months thereafter. Except as provided below or in Section&nbsp;14, if a Participant terminates his employment with the Company or its
Subsidiaries if an employee, his membership on the Board if a Director, or his retention as a consultant, for any reason, he forfeits any Options, Restricted Stock, SARs and/or Phantom Stock that are
not yet vested. A transfer from the Company to a Subsidiary or affiliate, or VICE VERSA is not a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan. Unless the Committee in its sole discretion
specifically waives the application of this sentence, then notwithstanding the vesting schedule contained herein or in the Participant's agreement, if the Participant's employment or retention as a
consultant, or if a Director, his membership on the Board, is terminated for Cause all Options, SARs, Restricted Stock and/or Phantom Stock granted or awarded to the Participant will be immediately
cancelled and forfeited by the Participant upon delivery to him of notice of such termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHANGE OF CONTROL.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of Section&nbsp;13 or anything contained in a Participant's agreement to the contrary, upon a Change in Control all Options,
Restricted Stock, SARs and/or Phantom Stock shall become 100% vested and immediately exercisable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company, the Board of Directors may make any adjustments necessary to prevent accretion, or to
protect against dilution, in the number and kind of shares authorized by the Plan and, with respect to outstanding Options, Restricted Stock, Phantom Stock and/or SARs, in the number and kind of
shares covered thereby and in the applicable Option Price. For the purpose of this Section&nbsp;15, a change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company includes, without limitation, any
change resulting from a recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, consolidation, rights offering, spin-off, reorganization, or liquidation and any transaction in which shares of
Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company or another corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND PHANTOM STOCK.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Options and SARs granted or Phantom Stock awarded under the Plan are not transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or the laws of descent
and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in Section&nbsp;414(p) of the Code. During a Participant's lifetime, his Options may be exercised only by him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Common Stock may be delivered upon the exercise of any Option until full payment has been made. A Participant has no rights whatsoever as a stockholder with
respect to any shares covered by an Option until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate for the shares. A Participant who has been granted SARs or Phantom Stock shall have no rights
whatsoever as a stockholder with respect to such SARs or Phantom Stock. </FONT></P>

Section&nbsp;16(a) or 16(b) of the Exchange Act, all amounts required to be withheld upon either (i)&nbsp;the vesting of Restricted Stock or (ii)&nbsp;the exercise of a SAR or surrender of
Phantom Stock which had a set duration and for which payment is made in Common Stock, shall automatically be withheld in Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant and having a Fair Market
Value determined on the date the income is includable in the Participant's income equal to the amount of taxes required to be withheld. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Plan will not give any Participant a right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any subsidiary, or any right or claim to any

provided, however, that (a)&nbsp;no change in any award previously granted to a Participant may be made that would impair the rights of the Participant without the Participant's consent,
(b)&nbsp;no amendment may extend the period during which a Participant may exercise an ISO beyond the period set forth in Section&nbsp;6(a)(ii)&nbsp;or 6(e), and (c)&nbsp;the Committee may

class of eligible individuals who may receive awards under the Plan, (iii)&nbsp;adopt any amendment affecting the Option Price at which Options may be granted, or (iv)&nbsp;materially increase
benefits accruing to participants under the Plan. If any amendment requiring shareholder approval for the Committee to act under part&nbsp;(c) of the previous sentence is made subsequent to the
first registration of any class of equity securities by the Company under Section&nbsp;12 of the Exchange Act, such shareholder approval shall be solicited as described in Section&nbsp;21. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within 12&nbsp;months before or after the date the Plan is adopted by
