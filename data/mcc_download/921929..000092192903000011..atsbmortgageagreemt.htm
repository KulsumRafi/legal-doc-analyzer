                  or other security interests,  <u>provided</u>, that (as regards this clause (3)), such
                  mortgage Liens or other security interests  effectively provide that such Spare
                  Engine  shall not  become  subject  to the Lien of such  mortgage  or  security
                  interest, notwithstanding the installation thereof on such airframe;

(D)      install a Spare Engine on an airframe registered in the United States leased to the Company
                  (or a Permitted  Lessee) or purchased by the Company (or a Permitted Lessee) subject
                  to a  conditional  sale or other  security  agreement,  <u>provided</u>  that (1) such
                   airframe  is free  and  clear  of all  Liens,  except:  (x) the  rights  of the
                  parties to the lease or conditional sale or other security  agreement  covering
                  such  airframe,  or their  assignees,  and (y) Liens of the type  permitted  by
                  clause (C) of this SECTION  2.01(B)(I) and (2) such lease,  conditional sale or
                  other security agreement  effectively provides that such Spare Engine shall not
                  become  subject to the Lien of such lease,  conditional  sale or other security
                  agreement, notwithstanding the installation thereof on such airframe;

(E)      install  a Spare  Engine on an airframe registered in the United States owned by the Company
                  (or a Permitted  Lessee),  leased to the Company or purchased by the Company subject
                  to a conditional  sale or other security  agreement under  circumstances  where
                  neither  clause (C) nor clause (D) of this SECTION  2.01(B)(I)  is  applicable,
                  <u>provided</u>  that any  divestiture  of title to such Spare Engine  resulting  from
                  such  installation  shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect to such Spare
                  Engine,  and the Company  shall comply with SECTION  3.01(A)  hereof in respect
                  thereof,  the  Collateral  Agent  not  intending  hereby  to waive any right or
                  interest  it may have to or in such Spare  Engine  under  applicable  law until
                  compliance by the Company with such SECTION 3.01(A);

(F)      transfer (or permit any Permitted Lessee to transfer) possession of any Spare Engine to the
                  United States of America or any instrumentality oragency thereof pursuant  to the
                  Civil  Reserve  Air Fleet  Program  so long as the  Company  shall  notify  the
                  Collateral Agent (1) prior to transferring  possession of any such Spare Engine
                  to the  United  States of  America  or any  agency or  instrumentality  thereof
                  pursuant  to the Civil  Reserve  Air Fleet  Program and (2) of the name and the
                  address of the Contracting  Office  Representative for the Air Mobility Command
                  of the  United  States  Air  Force to whom  notice  must be given  pursuant  to
                  SECTION 4.01(A) hereof;

(G)      transfer  possession of any Spare Engine to the United States of America or any instrumentality
                  or agency thereof pursuant to a lease, contract or other instrument, a copy of which
                  shall be provided to the Collateral Agent; or

(H)      enter into a lease of any Spare Engine with (1) a Certificated Air Carrier, (2) any airline
                  domiciled and principally located in a country listed on Exhibit D hereto, or (3)
                  any other Person approved in writing by the Collateral Agent;  provided that (I) no
                  such lease shall be permitted  to a lessee that is subject to a  proceeding  or
                  final order under applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency or reorganization laws on
                  the  date  the  lease  is  entered  into,  (II) in the  case  of a lease  under
                  subclause  (2) or (3)  above,  on the  date of such  lease  or any  renewal  or
                  extension  thereof,  the United  States and the country in which such lessee is
                  domiciled and principally  located maintain normal diplomatic  relations (which
                  for purposes of this clause (H) shall include  Taiwan),  (III) in the case only
                  of a lease to any Person  under  subclause  (3)  above,  the  Collateral  Agent
                  receives  at the time of such lease an  opinion  of  counsel  (in form and from
                  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Collateral  Agent) to the effect that
                  (w) the terms of the proposed lease will be legal, valid,  binding and (subject
                  to customary  exceptions  in foreign  opinions  generally  that are of a nature
                  accepted by financiers)  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms against the
                  proposed  lessee in the  country in which the  proposed  lessee is  principally
                  based,  (x) there exist no possessory  rights in favor of the lessee under such
                  lease  under the laws of such  lessee's  country of domicile  that would,  upon
                  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  of or other  default by the Company and assuming at
                  such time such  lessee is not  insolvent  or  bankrupt,  prevent  the return or
                  repossession  of such  Spare  Engine  in  accordance  with the  lease  and when
                  permitted by the terms of ARTICLE 4 upon the exercise by the  Collateral  Agent
                  of its  remedies  pursuant  to  such  Article,  (y) the  laws of such  lessee's
                  country  of  domicile  require  fair  compensation  by the  government  of such
                  jurisdiction  payable in currency freely  convertible into Dollars for the loss
                  of use of such Spare Engine in the event of the  requisition by such government
                  of such use, and (z) the laws of such lessee's  country of domicile  would give
                  recognition to the Company's title to the Spare Engine,  to the registration of
                  the Spare  Engine (if such  country  maintains a registry  for  engines) in the
                  name of the Company (or the proposed lessee, as "lessee", as appropriate),  and
                  to the Lien of the Security  Documents,  (IV) if the lessee under such lease is
                  a  governmental  entity,  such  lessee  has  waived  all  rights  of  sovereign
                  immunity,  and (V) if the lessee is a  Certificated  Air  Carrier,  the Company
                  will be entitled as lessor to the  benefits of Section  1110 of the  Bankruptcy
                  Code with respect to such Spare Engine in  connection  with a proceeding  under
                  Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in which the lessee is the debtor.

(ii)     The rights of any  transferee  (other than a  transferee  where the transfer is of a Spare
         Engine which is to be an Event of Loss) shall be (and the  assignment or other  transfer
         document under which such transfer is governed shall explicitly provide  that) during the
         period of such possession, subject and subordinate to, all the terms of the Security Docu-
         ments, including, without limitation, the covenants contained in this ARTICLE 2, including
         the  inspection  rights  contained in SECTION 2.05 and the  Collateral  Agent's right to
         repossess  such  Spare  Engine.   No  pooling   agreement,   Permitted  Lease  or  other
         relinquishment  of  possession  of any  Spare  Engine  shall  in any  way  discharge  or
         diminish any of the Company's  obligations  to the  Collateral  Agent under the Security
         Documents or constitute a waiver of Collateral  Agent's rights or remedies  hereunder or
         thereunder.

(iii)    In connection with any Permitted Lease, all necessary action shall be taken by the Company
         at its expense which is required to continue the Collateral Agent's security interest in the
         applicable  Spare Engine,  and such Permitted  Lease and all other  necessary  documents
         shall be duly filed,  registered  or recorded in such public  offices as may be required
         to fully  preserve  the  priority of the security  interest of the  Collateral  Agent in
         such  Spare  Engine.  Any Wet  Lease  shall  not  constitute  a  delivery,  transfer  or
         relinquishment  of possession for purposes of this SECTION 2.01.  The  Collateral  Agent
         acknowledges  that any  consolidation  or merger of the Company or conveyance,  transfer
         or  lease  of all or  substantially  all  of the  Company's  assets,  in  each  case  as
         permitted  by the Loan  Documents,  shall not be  prohibited  by this SECTION  2.01.  No
         Permitted  Lease  entered  into  pursuant  to this  SECTION  2.01(B)  shall  permit  any
         subleasing of the Spare Engines.

(iv)     Any  Permitted  Lease  having a term in excess of one (1) year  shall be assigned by the
         Company to the Collateral Agent as additional Collateral hereunder; <u>provided</u> that,
         except upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Specified Default or Event of
         Default,  (A) the Company shall be entitled to retain the rental payments made to the
         Company under such Permitted Lease, and (B) the rights as lessor under any Permitted Lease
         shall not vest (to the exclusion of the Company as lessor thereunder) in the Collateral
         Agent. Upon the occurrence of a default under such Permitted  Lease, both the Company and
         the Collateral Agent shall have the right, acting separately or together, to enforce the
         terms of such Permitted Lease;  <u>provided,  however</u>,  that upon the occurrence and during
         the continuance of a Specified  Default or Event of Default,  the Collateral Agent shall
         have the  exclusive  right to enforce the terms of such  Permitted  Lease.  In the event
         of the expiration or termination of the Permitted Lease, at the Company's  request,  the
         Collateral Agent shall release its interest in such Permitted Lease.

(c)      <u>Insignia</u>.  Within ninety (90) days after (x) the Closing Date (with  respect to Spare
Engines  covered by the Lien of the Security  Documents as of the  Closing  Date), and (y) the date
on which  any Security  Agreement Supplement (Spare  Engine) is delivered (with  respect to such
additional Collateral), and so long as any Spare Engines are subject to the Lien of the  Security
Documents,  the Company  agrees to affix and maintain (or cause to be affixed and  maintained) on
each Spare Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription:

                                   THIS ENGINE IS MORTGAGED TO
                                WELLS FARGO BANK NORTHWEST, N.A.,
                                       AS COLLATERAL AGENT


(such  nameplate  to be  replaced,  if  necessary,  with a nameplate  reflecting  the name of any
successor  collateral  agent,  in each case as  permitted  under the Loan  Documents).  Except as
above  provided,  the Company  will not allow the name of any Person other than the Company to be
placed on any Spare Engine as a  designation  that might be  interpreted  as a claim of ownership
or of any rights therein.

(d)      <u>Substitution  of Spare  Engines</u>.  The Company may at any time,  at its sole cost and
expense, replace any Spare Engine subjected to the Lien hereof by causing one or more Acceptable
Alternate Spare Engines to be substituted for such Spare Engine hereunder in accordance with the
provisions of SECTION 3.01(A) hereof to the same extent as if an Event of Loss has occurred with
respect to such Spare Engine; <u>provided</u>, that the terms of SECTION  3.01(A)(V) shall not apply
to any such substitution.

SECTION 2.02      <u>REPLACEMENT AND POOLING OF PARTS; ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS</u>.
(a)      <u>Replacement of Parts</u>.  The Company, at its own cost and expense,  will promptly
replace or cause to be replaced  all Parts of each Spare Engine that may from time to time become
worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently
rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.02(C).
All replacement parts shall be owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted
Liens,  pooling   arrangements   permitted  by  SECTION  2.02(B)  hereof  and  replacement  parts
temporarily  installed on an emergency basis) and shall be in as good an operating  condition as,
and shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts  replaced  assuming such replaced
Parts were in the  condition  and repair  required  to be  maintained  by the terms  hereof.  All
Parts at any time  removed  from any Spare  Engine  shall  remain the property of the Company and
subject to the Lien of the Security Documents,  no matter where located,  until such time as such
Parts shall be replaced by parts which meet the  requirements  for  replacement  parts  specified
above.  Immediately upon any replacement  part becoming  incorporated or installed in or attached
to any Spare  Engine,  without  further  act  (subject  only to  Permitted  Liens and any pooling
arrangement  permitted by SECTION  2.02(B)  hereof and except any  replacement  part  temporarily
installed  on an emergency  basis),  (i) such  replacement  part shall become the property of the
Company and subject to the Lien of the Security  Documents  and be deemed a Part for all purposes
hereof to the same extent as the Part  originally  incorporated  or  installed  in or attached to
such  Spare  Engine  and (ii) the  replaced  Part  shall be free and  clear of all  rights of the
Collateral Agent and shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(b)      <u>Pooling of Parts</u>.  Any Part  removed from any Spare Engine as provided in SECTION 2.02(A)
hereof may be subjected by the Company to a pooling arrangement of the type which is permitted by
clause (A) of SECTION  2.01(B)(I) hereof; <u>provided</u>, that the part replacing such removed Part shall be
incorporated  or  installed  in or  attached  to such Spare  Engine in  accordance  with  SECTION
2.02(a) as promptly as  practicable  after the removal of such removed  Part.  In  addition,  any
replacement  part when  incorporated  or installed in or attached to a Spare Engine in accordance
with  such  Section  may be owned by any  third  party  subject  to such a  pooling  arrangement,
<u>provided</u>,  that the Company (or any Permitted Lessee),  at its expense, as promptly thereafter as
practicable,  either  (i)  causes  such  replacement  part to become  subject  to the Lien of the
Security  Documents,  free and clear of all Liens  other than  Permitted  Liens or (ii)  replaces
such  replacement  part with a further  replacement  part owned by the Company (or any  Permitted
Lessee)  which shall  become the  property of the Company and subject to the Lien of the Security
Documents, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

(c)      <u>Alterations,  Modifications  and  Additions</u>.  The Company, at its own expense, will
make (or cause to be made) such alterations and modifications in and additions to the Spare Engines
as may be required to be made from time to time so as to comply with any law, rule, regulation or
order of any regulatory agency or body  of any jurisdiction  in  which  any  aircraft  may  then be
registered;  <u>provided,  however</u>,  that the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee) or any may, in good
faith,  and by  appropriate  proceedings  contest the  validity or  application  of any such law,
rule,  regulation or order in any reasonable  manner which does not materially  adversely  affect
the  Collateral  Agent,  the Board or any Lender or any of their  respective  legal and  economic
interests in or to such Spare  Engine,  or subject any such Person to risk of any material  civil
or any criminal  penalties or involve any material  risk of loss or  forfeiture  of title to such
Spare Engine. In addition,  the Company (or any Permitted Lessee),  at its own expense,  may from
time to time make such  alterations  and  modifications  in and  additions to any Spare Engine as
the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee) may deem  desirable in the proper conduct of its business,
including  removal of Parts which the Company (or any  Permitted  Lessee) deems to be obsolete or
no longer  suitable or appropriate for use on such Spare Engine (such parts,  "<u>Obsolete  Parts</u>");
<u>provided</u>  that no such  alteration,  modification,  removal or addition  impairs the condition or
airworthiness of such Spare Engine,  or materially  diminishes the value or utility of such Spare
Engine below the condition,  airworthiness,  value or utility thereof  immediately  prior to such
alteration,  modification,  removal  or  addition  assuming  such  Spare  Engine  was then in the
condition  required to be maintained by the terms of this Security  Agreement.  In addition,  the
value (but not the  utility,  condition or  airworthiness)  of any Spare Engine may be reduced by
the value,  if any, of Obsolete  Parts  which  shall have been  removed so long as the  aggregate
fair market  value of all Obsolete  Parts which shall have been  removed and not  replaced  shall
not exceed  1.5% of the then  Appraised  Value of such Spare  Engine (as shown in the most recent
Appraisal  Report  delivered on or prior to such date).  All Parts  incorporated  or installed in
or  attached  or added to a Spare  Engine  as the  result  of such  alteration,  modification  or
addition  (except  those parts which are excluded  from the  definition  of Parts or which may be
removed by the Company  pursuant to the next sentence) (the  "<u>Additional  Parts</u>") shall,  without
further  act,  become  subject  to  the  Lien  of the  Security  Documents.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing  sentence,  the Company may, at its own expense,  so long as no Event of Default  shall
have occurred and be  continuing,  remove or suffer to be removed any Additional  Part, <u>provided</u>
that such Additional  Part (i) is in addition to, and not in replacement of or substitution  for,
any Part  originally  incorporated or installed in or attached to any Spare Engine at the time of
delivery  thereof  hereunder or any part in  replacement  of or  substitution  for any such Part,
(ii) is not  required  to be  incorporated  or  installed  in or  attached  or added to any Spare
Engine  pursuant to the first  sentence of this  paragraph (c) and (iii) can be removed from such
Spare Engine without  diminishing  the condition,  airworthiness,  value or utility of such Spare
Engine which such Spare Engine would have had at such time had such  alteration,  modification or
addition not occurred.  Upon the removal  thereof as provided  above,  such Additional Part shall
no longer be deemed to be  subject  to the Lien of the  Security  Documents  or part of the Spare
Engine from which it was removed.

SECTION 2.03      <u>USE, POSSESSION AND DESIGNATED LOCATIONS OF SPARE PARTS AND PLEDGED EQUIPMENT</u>.

(a)      The Company shall have the right,  at any time and from time to time at its own cost and
expense, without any release from or consent by the Collateral Agent, to deal with the Spare Parts
and the Pledged  Equipment in any manner consistent with the Company's ordinary  course of business,
including without limitation any of the following:

(i)      with respect to the Spare Parts, to incorporate in, install on or attach or make appurtenant
         to any aircraft, engine or Appliance leased  to or owned  by the  Company  (whether  or not
         subject to any Lien) any Spare Part, free from the Lien of the Security Documents;

(ii)     with respect to the Spare Parts or the Pledged Equipment, to dismantle any Spare Part or
         Pledged Equipment that has become worn out or obsolete or unfit for use,  and to sell or
         dispose of any such Spare Part or Pledged  Equipment or any salvage  resulting from such
         dismantling, free from the Lien of the Security Documents; and

(iii)    with respect to the Spare Parts, to transfer any or all of the Spare Parts located at one
         or more Designated Locations to one or more other Designated Locations.

(b)      Without the prior consent of the Collateral  Agent, the Company will not sell, lease,
transfer or relinquish possession of any Spare Part or any Pledged Equipment to any Person, except
as permitted by the provisions of this SECTION  2.03 and except that the Company shall have the
right in the ordinary  course of business,  (i) to transfer  possession  of any Spare Part or any
Pledged  Equipment to the  Manufacturer  thereof or any service  provider for testing,  overhaul,
repairs,  maintenance,  alterations or  modifications  purposes,  (ii) to sell any of the same in
the  ordinary  course of  business  or (iii) to  subject  any  Spare  Part to an  interchange  or
pooling,  exchange,  borrowing  or  maintenance  servicing  arrangement  customary in the airline
industry and entered into in the ordinary  course of  business;  <u>provided,  however</u>,  that in the
case of any sale or if the  Company's  title to any such Spare Part shall be  divested  under any
such  agreement  or  arrangement,  such  divestiture  shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with
respect  to  such  Spare  Part  subject  to the  provisions  of  SECTION  3.01(B).  So long as no
Specified  Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  and subject to the
Company's  obligations  under SECTION 3.01 hereof and Section 2.6(c) of the Loan  Agreement,  the
Company  shall be entitled  to retain all  payments  received  by it in respect of any  warranty,
indemnity or similar agreement  relating to Spare Parts,  Pledged Equipment and Spare Engines and
deal with the  counterparties  to such agreements  with respect to its rights  thereunder in such
manner as the Company deems appropriate.

(c)      The Company shall maintain and keep the Spare Parts at one or more of the Designated
Locations, except as otherwise permitted under this SECTION  2.03. If (x) any Spare Part, at any
time and for any reason, is stored at any other than a Designated Location or (y) the Company wishes
to subject additional unencumbered spare parts of a type which are similar to the Spare Parts pledged
hereunder  (including,  without  limitation,  spare parts suitable for  installation  in or on an
Airbus  aircraft  or an engine  utilized  thereon)  to the Lien of the  Security  Documents,  the
Company will promptly furnish to the Collateral Agent the following:

(i)      a Security Agreement Supplement (Spare Parts) duly executed by the Company, describing the
         additional unencumbered spare parts which are being subjected to the Lien of the Security
         Documents  (if  applicable)  and/or  identifying  each  location  that  is to  become  a
         Designated  Location  and  specifically  subjecting  the Spare Parts (or spare parts) at
         such location to the Lien of the Security Documents;

(ii)     a legal  opinion from counsel (which opinion and counsel shall be  reasonably satisfactory
         to the Collateral Agent), dated the date of execution of said Security Agreement Supplement
         (Spare Parts),  stating that said Security  Agreement  Supplement (Spare Parts) has been
         duly filed for  recording in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the Federal  Aviation
         Act,  and  either:  (A) no other  filing or  recording  is  required  in any other place
         within the United  States in order to perfect the Lien of the Security  Documents on the
         Spare  Parts  (or  spare  parts)  held at the  Designated  Locations  specified  in such
         Security  Agreement  Supplement  (Spare Parts) under the laws of the United  States,  or
         (B) if any such  filing  or  recording  shall be  required  that  said  filing  has been
         accomplished  in such other  manner and places,  which shall be  specified in such legal
         opinion, as are necessary to perfect the Lien of the Security Documents; and

(iii)    an Officer's Certificate stating that in the opinion of the officer executing the Officers'
         Certificate, all conditions precedent provided for in this Security Agreement relating to the
         subjection  of such  property to the Lien of the Security  Documents  have been complied
         with.

                  The Company shall,  on an ongoing  basis,  effect any filings or recordings (or
amend any  existing  filings or  recordings)  which are  necessary  or  desirable  to perfect the
security  interest of the  Collateral  Agent in the Spare Parts and the Pledged  Equipment  which
are being  subjected to the Lien hereof in accordance  with this SECTION 2.03 and shall  promptly
deliver copies of any such filings or recordings to the Collateral Agent.

SECTION 2.04      <u>INSURANCE</u>.

(a)      <u>Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance</u>.

(i)      Except as provided in clause (II) of this SECTION  2.04(A), the Company will carry or cause
         to be carried with respect to each Spare Engine at its expense (A) comprehensive airline
         liability (including, without limitation, passenger, contractual, bodily injury, and property
         damage liability and product liability) insurance  (exclusive of Manufacturer's  product
         liability   insurance)  and  (B)  war  risk,   hijacking  and  allied  perils  liability
         insurance,  in each case (I) in an amount per  occurrence  not less than the  greater of

         applicable  per  occurrence  to engines  owned or leased and  operated by the Company of
         the same type as such Spare  Engines and (y) the  Minimum  Liability  Insurance  Amount,
         (II) of the same  type and  covering  at least  the same  risks as from time to time are
         applicable  to engines  owned or leased and  operated by  similarly  situated  U.S.  Air
         Carriers owning and operating similar aircraft and engines ("<u>Similar  Carriers</u>"), (III)
          which is  maintained in effect with insurers of  internationally  recognized  reputation
         and reasonably  believed to be financially  sound  ("<u>Insurers</u>")  and (IV) in the case of
          war risk,  hijacking  and allied  perils  coverage,  of a scope  then  being  carried by
         Similar Carriers,  at least in the Minimum  Liability  Amount,  which may be effected by
         combining  insurance  available in  commercial  insurance  markets with  coverage of the
         type  described  in SECTION  2.04(F)  (it being  agreed that the  Company's  obligations
         under this  clause  (IV) shall be subject in any event and at all times to whether  such
         coverage  is  available  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  through a  combination  of
         commercial insurance coverage and coverage of the type described in SECTION 2.04(F)).

(ii)     During any period that a Spare Engine is on the ground and not in  operation, the Company
         may carry or cause to be carried as to such non-operating property, in lieu of the insurance
         required  by clause (I) above,  insurance  by  Insurers  otherwise  conforming  with the
         provisions  of clause (I) except that (A) the amounts of coverage  shall not be required
         to exceed the amounts of  comprehensive  airline  liability  insurance from time to time
         applicable  to  property  owned  or  leased  by the  Company  of the  same  type as such
         non-operating  property  and which is on the  ground and not in  operation;  and (B) the
         scope of the risks  covered and the type of insurance  shall be the same as from time to
         time shall be  applicable  to property  owned or leased by Similar  Carriers of the same
         type as such non-operating property and which is on the ground and not in operation.

(iii)    The Company will carry or cause to be carried at all  times, (x) with respect to the Spare
         Parts, comprehensive airline liability insurance, including, without limitation, property
         damage   liability   insurance   and  (y)  with   respect  to  the  Pledged   Equipment,
         comprehensive  property  damage  liability  insurance,  in each  case,  which  is (A) of
         amount and scope as may be  customarily  maintained  by Similar  Carriers  for  property
         similar to the Spare  Parts and  Pledged  Equipment  and (B)  maintained  in effect with
         Insurers.

(b)      <u>Insurance  Against  Loss or Damage to a Spare  Engine,  etc</u>. The Company shall
maintain or cause to be maintained in effect, at its (or a Permitted  Lessee's) expense, (A) with
Insurers, "all-risk" coverage of Spare Engines (while such Spare Engines are either (x) installed
on any airframe or (y) not installed on an airframe) and Spare Parts and (B) with insurers of
nationally recognized reputation and reasonably believed to be financially sound, "all-risk" coverage
with respect to Pledged Equipment, in each case in such forms as are customarily  maintained  with
respect to similar  property  owned or operated by Similar  Carriers and in an amount of coverage
not less than the Insured  Amount  therefor.  In addition,  the Company shall maintain in respect
of the Spare  Engines war risk,  hijacking  and allied  perils  insurance  of a scope  carried by
Similar  Carriers in an amount  equal to the Insured  Amount  therefor,  unless and to the extent
that SECTION  2.04(A)(II) shall apply (it being agreed that the Company's  obligations under this
sentence  shall be subject in any event and at all times to whether  such  coverage is  available
on  commercially  reasonable  terms through a combination  of commercial  insurance  coverage and
coverage of the type  described in SECTION  2.04(F)).  All losses will be adjusted by the Company
(giving  due  regard to the interest of the Collateral  Agent) with the insurers; <u>provided</u>,
however,  that during a period when any Specified Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing,  the Company shall not agree to any such adjustment  without the prior written
consent of the Collateral  Agent. As between the Collateral  Agent and the Company,  it is agreed
that all  proceeds of  insurance  maintained  in  compliance  with the  preceding  paragraph  and
received as the result of the  occurrence of an Event of Loss will be applied in accordance  with
SECTION 3.01.

(c)      <u>Reports,  Certificates,  etc</u>. The Company will furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to the Collateral Agent on or before the Closing Date, and each annual renewal of the applicable
insurances,  (i) a report, signed by a recognized independent firm of insurance brokers reasonably
acceptable to the  Collateral Agent which brokers may be regularly retained by the Company (the
<u>"Insurance Brokers"</u>), describing in reasonable detail the property and liability insurance
then carried and maintained with respect to the Collateral and stating the opinion of such firm
that (A) such  insurance complies with the terms hereof, (B) all premiums in connection with such
insurance  then  due have  been  paid and (C) such  insurance  together  with any  self-insurance
permitted  hereby  provides  coverages  against  risks that are  customarily  insured  against by
Similar  Carriers and that such coverages are in  substantially  similar forms, are of such types
and have  limits as are  customarily  carried  by Similar  Carriers;  and (ii) a  certificate  of
insurance  evidencing  the due  compliance  with  the  terms of this  SECTION  2.04  relating  to
insurance with respect to the  Collateral.  To the extent that the insurance  obligations of this
SECTION  2.04  are  satisfied  in part  with the  coverage  described  in  SECTION  2.04(F),  the
Insurance  Broker's report and  certificate  need not certify such coverage but may instead refer
to the FAA  Certificate  of Insurance  (which the  Insurance  Broker shall attach to its report).
The Company will cause such Insurance  Broker to agree to advise the Collateral  Agent in writing
of any  default  in the  payment of any  premium  and of any act or  omission  on the part of the
Company of which it has knowledge and which might  invalidate or render  unenforceable,  in whole
or in part,  any insurance on the applicable  Collateral  and to advise the  Collateral  Agent in
writing  at least  thirty  (30) days  (twenty  (20) days in the case of lapse for  nonpayment  of
premiums  and seven (7) days in the case of war risk and  allied  perils  coverage)  prior to the
cancellation  (but not  expiration),  lapse for non-payment of premium or material adverse change
of any insurance  maintained  pursuant to this SECTION 2.04; <u>provided</u> that if the war risk notice
period  specified  above is not  reasonably  obtainable,  the  Company  will cause the  Insurance
Broker to provide for as long a period of prior  notice as shall then be  reasonably  obtainable.
In the event that the  Company  shall fail to  maintain or cause to be  maintained  insurance  as
herein  provided,  the Collateral  Agent may, at its sole option,  but shall be under no duty to,
procure  such  insurance  on behalf of the Company and, in such event,  the Company  shall,  upon
demand,  reimburse the Collateral  Agent for the cost thereof to the Collateral  Agent,  together
with  interest on such cost at the Overdue Rate from the date of such  payment by the  Collateral
Agent to the date of  reimbursement  without waiver of any other rights the Collateral  Agent may
have;  <u>provided,  however</u>,  that no exercise by the Collateral  Agent of said option shall affect
the provisions of this Security  Agreement or the other Loan Documents,  including the provisions
that failure by the Company to maintain the  prescribed  insurance  shall  constitute an Event of
Default.  Upon  receipt of any  notices or  reports,  the  Collateral  Agent shall as promptly as
practicable forward copies of the same to the Agent, the Loan  Administrator,  the Board and each
of the Lenders.  The Collateral Agent shall have no responsibility  for  independently  verifying
the accuracy or completeness of any information  contained in any report or certificate  provided
by the Insurance Brokers.

(d)      <u>Self-Insurance</u>.  The Company (but no Permitted  Lessee) may  self-insure the risks
required to be insured against pursuant to this SECTION 2.04 under a program applicable to all
aircraft and engines (whether owned or leased) in the Company's fleet, but in no case shall the
aggregate amount of such self-insurance in regard to SECTION 2.04(A) and SECTION 2.04(B) hereof for
any calendar year, with respect to all of the aircraft and  engines (whether owned or leased) in the
Company's  fleet,  exceed  $1,000,000.  In addition to the foregoing  right to  self-insure,  the
Company may self-insure  the risks required to be insured  against  pursuant to this SECTION 2.04
in an amount  equal to any  applicable  minimum per  occurrence  (or, if  applicable,  annual (or
other) period) deductible  imposed by its property or liability  Insurer,  which are commensurate
with the standard deductibles in the aircraft insurance industry.

(e)      <u>Additional  Insurance by the Company</u>.  The Company may at its own expense carry
insurance with respect to its  interest in the Spare Engines and Spare Parts in amounts in excess
of that required to be maintained by this SECTION 2.04; <u>provided, however</u>, that such insurance does
not prevent the Company  from  carrying  the  insurance  required or  permitted by this SECTION 2.04
or adversely affect such insurance or the cost thereof; and <u>provided, further</u>, that the
proceeds of such insurance shall be subject to Section 2.6(c) of the Loan Agreement.

(f)      <u>Indemnification  by Government in Lieu of Insurance</u>.  Notwithstanding any provisions
of this SECTION 2.04 requiring insurance, the Collateral Agent agrees to accept, in lieu of insurance
required by the terms of this SECTION  2.04, indemnification from, or insurance provided by, the United
States  Government,  against such risk in an amount which,  when added to the amount of insurance
against such risk  maintained  by the Company  shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance
against such risk  otherwise  required by this  SECTION 2.04 (taking into account  self-insurance
permitted by SECTION  2.04(D)  hereof).  Any such  indemnification  or insurance  provided by the
United  States  Government  shall  provide  substantially  similar  protection  as the  insurance
required  by this  SECTION  2.04  (other  than  SECTION  2.04(G)  to the  extent  that any of the
provisions of such section are generally  unavailable  from the United  States  Government).  The
Company  shall furnish to the  Collateral  Agent a copy of any FAA  Certificate  of Insurance (if
such  certificates  are then being  furnished by the FAA),  and at the request of the  Collateral
Agent,  an Officer's  Certificate  confirming in  reasonable  detail the amount and scope of such
indemnification  or insurance and  certifying  that such  indemnification  or insurance  complies
with the terms of this SECTION 2.04(F).

(g)      <u>Terms of  Insurance  Policies</u>.  Any policies carried in accordance with SECTION
2.04(A) and SECTION 2.04(b) hereof covering the applicable Collateral, and any policies taken out
in substitution or replacement for any such policies, (i) shall name the Additional Insureds as
additional insureds, as their respective interests may appear (but without imposing on any such
party liability to pay premiums with respect to such insurance), (ii) shall name the Collateral
Agent as sole loss payee in respect of insurances maintained pursuant to SECTION 2.04(B);
<u>provided</u>, Default, in respect of any casualty occurrence the insurance proceedsof which
are less than $2,000,000, such insurance proceeds shall be paid directly to the Company, (iii)
may provide for self-insurance to the extent permitted in SECTION 2.04(D) hereof, (iv) shall
provide that if the insurers cancel such insurance for any reason whatever, or if the same is
allowed to lapse for non-payment of premium or if any  material change is made in the insurance
which adversely affects the interest of any Additional Insured, such lapse, cancellation  or change
shall not be  effective  as to any  Additional  Insured for thirty (30) days (twenty (20) days in
the case of lapse  for  non-payment  of  premiums  and seven (7) days in the case of war risk and
allied  perils  coverage)  after  receipt by such  Additional  Insured of written  notice by such
insurers of such lapse,  cancellation or change;  <u>provided,  however</u>, that if the war risk notice
period  specified above is not reasonably  obtainable,  such policies shall provide for as long a
period  of prior  notice as shall  then be  reasonably  obtainable,  (v)  shall  provide  that in
respect of the  respective  interests of each  Additional  Insured in such policies the insurance
shall not be  invalidated  by any action or inaction of the Company or any other Person and shall
insure the respective  interests of the Additional  Insureds,  as they appear,  regardless of any
breach or violation of any warranty,  declaration or condition  contained in such policies by the
Company or by any other  Person,  (vi) shall be primary  without any right of  contribution  from
any other insurance  which is carried by any Additional  Insured,  (vii) shall expressly  provide
that all of the  provisions  thereof,  except the limits of liability,  shall operate in the same
manner as if there were a separate policy covering each  Additional  Insured,  (viii) shall waive
any right of the  insurers  to  set-off,  recoupment  or  counterclaim  or any  other  deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise,  in respect of any liability of any Additional Insured,  (ix)
shall waive any right of the insurers to  subrogation  against any  Additional  Insured,  and (x)
shall  provide  for a 50/50  claims  settlement  per AVS 103 or its  equivalent,  except  that if
coverage  required  under this SECTION 2.04 is then being provided  under SECTION  2.04(F),  such
claims  settlement  shall be made pursuant to provisions then generally in effect with respect to
commercial aviation insurance.

(h)     <u>Application  of  Payments  During  Existence  of a Specified  Default or an Event of  Default</u>.
Any amount referred to in this SECTION 2.04 which is payable to or retainable by the Company (or
any Permitted  Lessee) shall not be paid to or retained by the Company (or any  Permitted  Lessee)
if at the time of such payment or retention a Specified  Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing,  but shall, so long as such Specified  Default or an Event of Default
is  continuing,  be held by or paid over to the  Collateral  Agent and, at the  direction  of the
Board (or if the Board  Guarantee  is no longer in effect,  the  Requisite  Lenders),  subject to
applicable law, be applied  against the  obligations of the Company under the Loan Documents.  At
such time as there shall not be continuing any such Specified  Default or Event of Default,  such
amount shall be paid to the Company to the extent not previously  applied in accordance  with the
preceding  sentence.  Prior to remitting  any such funds to the  Company,  the  Collateral  Agent
shall be authorized to request and receive an Officer's  Certificate from the Company  certifying
that no Specified Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

SECTION 2.05      <u>INSPECTION</u>.

(a)      Subject to  subsection  (B),  at  reasonable  times but not more often than once in any twelve
(12) month period, and upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the Company (<u>provided,
however</u>, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any such inspection
shall be at reasonable times without any limit on the number of times and upon at least one (1)
Business Day's prior written notice to and at the expense of the Company), the Collateral Agent or
the Board or their respective authorized representatives may inspect the Spare Engines, Spare Parts
and Pledged  Equipment,  inspect and make copies of the books and records of the Company relating
to such  Collateral,  including  books and records  required to be maintained by the FAA or other
applicable  regulatory  agency or body, and access (with  assistance from Company  personnel) the
Tracking System (at the Company's risk and expense).  Any such  inspection of Pledged  Equipment,
Spare  Engine or any Spare  Part  shall be subject to the  Company's  safety and  security  rules
applicable at the location of such  Collateral  and, so long as no Specified  Default or Event of
Default  shall have  occurred  and be  continuing,  no  exercise of such  inspection  right shall
interfere  with the  normal  operation  or  maintenance  of such  Collateral  by,  or the  normal
business  operations of, the Company.  Neither the Collateral  Agent nor the Board shall have any
duty to make any such  inspection  and shall incur no  liability or  obligation  by reason of not
making any such inspection.

(b)      The Company  shall at all times  maintain the Tracking  System in at least as favorable
a condition as the condition as at the Closing Date and its perpetual inventory procedures for
the Spare Engines, Spare Parts and Pledged Equipment that provide a continuous internal audit of
the Spare Engines, Spare Parts and the Pledged Equipment. Notwithstanding subsection (A), at any
time during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to the Company (without any limit on
the number of times),  the  Collateral  Agent shall be entitled  to inspect the  Tracking  System
relating  to the  Collateral  to ensure the  Company's  compliance  with the terms  hereof.  Such
inspection  right shall not be  exercised in a manner  which is unduly  disruptive  to the normal
operation  or  maintenance  of the  Tracking  System or the  normal  business  operations  of the
Company.

SECTION 2.06      <u>PLEDGED EQUIPMENT/TAX RECEIVABLE</u>.  The Company shall:

(a)      upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and upon the request
of the Collateral Agent, promptly (i) notify the Tax Receivable Debtor in respect of the Pledged Tax
Receivable that the Pledged Tax Receivable has been assigned to the Collateral  Agent  hereunder,
and that any  payments  due or to become due in respect  thereof  are to be made  directly to the
Collateral  Agent or its designee (it being  understood  and agreed that the foregoing  shall not
limit the rights of the Collateral  Agent upon the  occurrence  and during the  continuance of an
Event of  Default  to so notify the Tax  Receivable  Debtor  without  giving  prior  notice to or
making a demand upon the  Company  including,  without  limitation,  any  notices  required to be
given under the  Anti-Assignment  Act (31 U.S.C.ss. 3727)) and (ii)  transfer  to the  Collateral
Agent or its designee  all funds  received by it from or on behalf of the Tax  Receivable  Debtor
in respect of the  Pledged  Tax  Receivable  (it being  acknowledged  and agreed that the Company
shall be deemed to be holding  all such funds as trustee for the  Collateral  Agent and, as such,
shall not  commingle  such funds with other  funds of the  Company);  and in  furtherance  of the
rights of the  Collateral  Agent's  described  in the  parenthetical  to clause  (i)  above,  the
Company shall deliver to the  Collateral  Agent on the Closing Date an executed  undated power of
attorney in favor of the  Collateral  Agent and such other  documents  or  agreements  reasonably
requested by the Collateral Agent (in form and substance  reasonably  acceptable to it) to enable
the Collateral  Agent to comply,  upon the  occurrence and during the  continuance of an Event of
Default, with the terms of the Anti-Assignment Act (31 U.S.C.ss.3727);

(b)      upon the acquisition after the date hereof by the Company of any additional or replacement
Motor Vehicle, other than a Motor Vehicle described  in the  proviso to the  definition  of Pledged
Equipment or a Motor  Vehicle as to which the Company  need not perfect the security  interest of
the  Collateral  Agent thereon  pursuant to clause (a) of the  penultimate  sentence of paragraph
(3) of the Habendum  Clause,  cause the  Collateral  Agent to be listed as the lienholder on such
certificate  of title and take such other steps as may be required  under the law  applicable  to
perfection  of a security  interest  in such  property to perfect  such  security  interest,  and
within 30 days of the acquisition thereof deliver evidence of the same to the Collateral Agent;

(c)      use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be collected from the Tax Receivable Debtor,
as and when due all amounts owing under or on account of the Pledged Tax Receivable (including,
without limitation, a Pledged Tax Receivable which is delinquent, which shall  be  collected  in
accordance  with lawful  collection  procedures)  and shall apply  forthwith upon receipt thereof
all such amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance of the Pledged Tax Receivable;

(d)      keep the Pledged  Equipment in good working order and repair, and not use such Collateral
in violation of law or any policy of insurance thereon; and

(e)      not change (i) its name, identity or corporate structure in any manner,  (ii) its "location"
(as such term is defined in Article 9 of the UCC) from Colorado, (iii) the  location  of its chief
executive office or (iv) its  jurisdiction of organization in any manner,  unless (in the case of
any event  described  in clause (i)  through  (iv)) it shall have given the  Collateral  Agent at
least thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof.

SECTION 2.07      <u>LIENS</u>.  The Company will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to any Collateral, except Permitted Liens. The Company
shall promptly,  at its own expense,  take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge any Lien
(other than a Permitted Liens) arising at any time.

SECTION 2.08      <u>FURTHER  ASSURANCES</u>.  The Company agrees that it will promptly correct any
defect or error that may be discovered in any document delivered in connection with the Security
Documents to which it is a party or in the execution, acknowledgment or recordation thereof.

SECTION 3.01      <u>EVENT OF LOSS; APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS AND PROCEEDS</u>.

(a)      <u>Event of Loss with Respect to a Spare Engine</u>.

(i)      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to any Spare Engine, the Company shall:

(A)      forthwith  (and in any event,  within five (5) Business Days after such  occurrence)  give the
                  Collateral Agent written notice of such Event of Loss; and

                  following  options  (it being  understood  that the failure to give such notice
                  shall be deemed to be an  election  of the  option set forth in  subclause  (1)
                  below):

(1)      Not later than the earlier of (x) the Business Day next succeeding the ninetieth (90th)day

                           make such  substitution in accordance with the terms hereof,  then the
                           Company  shall make the payments  required by clause (1) above on such
                           date.

(ii)     At such time as the Company shall have complied fully with the provisions of clause (1) above,
         the Collateral  Agent  shall  release  from the Lien of the  Security  Documents  such Spare
         Engine by  executing  and  delivering  to the Company  all  documents  and  instruments,
         prepared at the Company's sole cost and expense,  as the Company may reasonably  request
         to evidence such release.

(iii)    The Company's right to substitute any Replacement Engine as provided in clause (B)(2) of
         SECTION 3.01(A)(I) shall be subject to the fulfillment (which may be simultaneous with such
         replacement),  at the  Company's  sole cost and  expense,  of the  following  conditions
         precedent:

(A)      on the date when any Replacement Engine is subjected to the Lien of the Security Documents
                  (such date being referred to in this SECTION 3.01 as the "Replacement Closing Date"),
                  the following documents shall have been duly authorized,  executed and delivered by
                  the respective  party or parties thereto and shall be in full force and effect,
                  and an executed  counterpart  of each thereof shall have been  delivered by the
                  Company to the Collateral Agent:

(I)      a Security Agreement Supplement (Spare Engine) covering such Replacement Engine, which shall
                           have been duly filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act; and

(II)     UCC financing statements covering such Replacement Engine, which shall have been duly filed
                           for recordation in such places as shall be required;

(B)      each Replacement Engine shall be an Acceptable Alternate Spare Engine (subject to subsection
                  (A)(V) below), and the Collateral Agent shall have received an Appraisal Report from
                  an Appraiser of such Replacement  Engine  (together with any other  Replacement
                  Engines that are  replacing a Spare  Engine),  dated  within ten (10)  Business
                  Days of the Replacement  Closing Date,  evidencing that such Replacement Engine
                  is of at least  the same  value as the  replaced  Spare  Engine  at the time of
                  replacement  (assuming the replaced Spare Engine was in the condition and state
                  of repair required by this Security Agreement) (<u>provided</u>, that if the Company
                  is pledging an Available  Engine in  accordance  with  subsection  (A)(V) below
                  such  Appraisal  Report shall set forth the  Appraised  Value of the  Available
                  Engine and shall not be required to state that such  Available  Engine is of at
                  least the same value as the replaced Spare Engine at the time of replacement);

(C)      the Collateral Agent shall have received satisfactory evidence as to the compliance with
                  SECTION 2.04 with respect to such Replacement Engine;

(D)      the Collateral Agent, at the expense of the Company, shall have received (acting directly
                  or by authorization to its special counsel) (I) an opinion of counsel to the Company
                  (which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory  to the Collateral
                  Agent),  addressed to the Collateral Agent, to the effect that each Replacement
                  Engine has been made  subject to the Lien of the Security  Documents,  that all
                  required  action has been taken in order to  maintain,  and such  action  shall
                  maintain,  the  effectiveness  and  perfection  (to the extent the same existed
                  immediately  prior  to the  occurrence  of such  Event of  Loss,  assuming  the
                  Company was in  compliance  with all  relevant  terms  hereof) of the  security
                  interests  in such Spare  Engine  and title  thereto  created by this  Security
                  Agreement  and that,  except as may have been  effected by a change in law, the
                  protections  afforded to the Collateral Agent by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
                  Code  will  not  be  less  than  such  protections  immediately  prior  to  the
                  occurrence of such Event of Loss  (assuming the Company was in compliance  with
                  all relevant  terms  hereof) and (II) an opinion of  qualified  FAA counsel (or
                  counsel in any  jurisdiction  outside the United  States where the  Replacement
                  Engine  and/or  the  aircraft  of which  such  Replacement  Engine is a part is
                  required to be registered in accordance  with applicable law (which opinion and
                  counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Collateral  Agent),  addressed
                  to the  Collateral  Agent,  stating,  in the  case  of FAA  counsel,  that  the
                  Security  Agreement  Supplement  (Spare  Engine)  and all  other  documents  or
                  instruments  the  recordation  of which is necessary to perfect and protect the
                  rights of the Collateral Agent in each such  Replacement  Engine have been duly
                  recorded and that each such Replacement  Engine is free and clear of any liens,
                  security  interests  and  encumbrances  of record  with the FAA, in the case of
                  counsel in another  jurisdiction,  that all action  necessary has been taken in
                  such jurisdiction for such purposes;

(E)      the  representation  contained  in Section  4.5 of the Loan  Agreement  with  respect to such  Replacement
                  Engine shall be true and correct; and

(F)      the  Collateral  Agent shall have  received an  Officer's  Certificate  of the  Company  stating  that all
                  conditions  precedent  provided  for in this SECTION  3.01(A)  relating to such
                  replacement have been complied with and representing  that any such Replacement
                  Engine is an Acceptable  Alternate  Spare Engine and authorizing the Collateral
                  Agent to rely on such Officer's Certificate.

(iv)     Upon satisfaction of all conditions to such substitution, (x) the Collateral Agent shall
         execute and deliver to the Company such documents and instruments, prepared by the Company
         at the Company's sole cost and expense, as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence
         the  release  of  each  such  replaced  Spare  Engine  from  the  Lien  of the  Security
         Documents,  (y) the Collateral  Agent shall assign to the Company all claims it may have
         against  any  other  Person   relating  to  any  Event  of  Loss  giving  rise  to  such
         substitution  and (z)  subject to Section  2.6(c) of the Loan  Agreement  (to the extent
         that less than 100% of the insurance  proceeds  received in respect of the Event of Loss
         giving rise to such  replacement  were used to acquire  such  Replacement  Engine),  the
         Company  shall  receive  all  insurance  proceeds  and other  proceeds in respect of any
         Event of Loss  giving  rise to such  replacement.  For all  purposes  hereof,  each such
         Replacement  Engine so  substituted  shall be deemed to be  subjected to the Lien of the
         Security Documents and shall be deemed a "Spare Engine" as defined herein.

(v)      Anything to the contrary contained in this SECTION 3.01(A) notwithstanding, in the event that,
         following an Event of Loss, (x) the only unencumbered engines owned by the Company are engines
         which do not meet the  criteria  for  Acceptable  Alternate  Spare  Engines  (each  such
         engine, an "<u>Available  Engine</u>"), or (y) the Company does not then own any unencumbered
         engines,  and in the case of each of (x) and (y),  the  Company  does not  intend to use
         the proceeds  received in  connection  with such Event of Loss to acquire an  Acceptable
         Alternate  Spare Engine,  then in lieu of pledging an Acceptable  Alternate Spare Engine
         in  accordance  with this  SECTION  3.01(A),  the  Company  shall be  entitled to do the
         following on or prior to the date set forth in SECTION 3.01(A)(I)(B)(2):

(A)      in the case of (x) above, pledge to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms hereof
                  (1) such Available Engines or (2) such Available Engine(s) and unencumbered spare
                  parts (of a type which are similar to the Spare Parts pledged hereunder), in each
                  case  which  have an  aggregate  value  at  least  equal  to the  most  current
                  Appraised Value of the Spare Engine being replaced; and

(B)      in the case of (y) above, pledge to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms hereof
                  unencumbered  spare  parts (of a type  which  are  similar  to the Spare  Parts
                  pledged  hereunder)  which have an  aggregate  value at least equal to the most
                  current Appraised Value of the Spare Engine being replaced;

         so long as,  on or  prior to such  date,  the  Company  shall  have  (I)  satisfied  the
         conditions  precedent set forth in SECTION  3.01(A)(III),  in connection with the pledge
         of any Available  Engine,  (II) satisfied the conditions  precedent set forth in SECTION
         2.03(C)(I)  through (III), in connection with the pledge of such spare parts,  and (III)
         in the Officer's  Certificate  delivered pursuant to SECTION  3.01(A)(III)(F) or SECTION
         2.03(C)(III),  as the case may be,  included a  certification  that the Company does not
         intend to use the  proceeds  received in  connection  with such Event of Loss to acquire
         an Acceptable  Alternate  Spare Engine.  Upon  satisfaction  of the terms and conditions
         of  this  subsection  (A)(V),  the  Company  shall  be  deemed  to  have  satisfied  its
         obligations  under  SECTION  3.01(A)(I)(B)(2)  to pledge an Acceptable  Alternate  Spare
         Engine in place of the Spare Engine subject to such Event of Loss.

         The parties  acknowledge and agree that this  subsection  (A)(V) shall not be applicable
         to a substitution of a Spare Engine effected pursuant to SECTION 2.01(D).

(b)      <u>Event  of Loss  with  Respect  to Spare  Parts or  Pledged  Equipment</u>.  As between
the Company and the Collateral Agent,  all insurance proceeds received in respect of Spare Parts or
Pledged Equipment, whether as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss, or property damage or
loss not constituting an Event of Loss,  under policies  required to be maintained by the Company
pursuant  to  SECTION  2.04 and all  proceeds  of a transfer  of title to Spare  Parts or Pledged
Equipment  contemplated  by the terms of SECTION  2.03(B) will be applied in accordance  with the
provisions of Section 2.6(c) of the Loan Agreement.

(c)      <u>Application  of Payments  from  Governmental  Authorities  for  Requisition  of Title,  etc</u>.
Any payments (other than insurance proceeds the application of which is provided for elsewhere in this
SECTION  3.01)  received  at any  time  by  the  Collateral  Agent  or by the  Company  from  any
Governmental  Authority  or  other  Person  with  respect  to an  Event  of  Loss,  other  than a
requisition  for use by the United  States  Government  or other  government  of  registry  of an
aircraft  or any  instrumentality  or agency of any thereof  not  constituting  an Event of Loss,
will be applied in accordance with Section 2.6(c) of the Loan Agreement.

(d)      <u>Requisition for Use of a Spare Engine by the United States Government or the Government of
Registry of an Aircraft</u>. In the event of the requisition for use of a Spare Engine by the United
States Government or any other government of registry of the applicable  aircraft or any agency or
instrumentality  of any  thereof  (other than in the  circumstances  contemplated  by  subsection
(e)), any payments  received by Collateral Agent or the Company from such government with respect
to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained by the Company.

(e)      <u>Application  of  Payments  During  Existence  of  Specified  Defaults  and Events of  Default</u>.
Any amount referred  to in this SECTION 3.01 which is payable to or retainable by the Company (or
any Permitted  Lessee) shall not be paid to or retained by the Company (or any Permitted Lessee)
if at the time of such payment or retention a Specified  Default or any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be  continuing,  but shall be held by or paid over to  Collateral  Agent and, at the
direction  of the  Board (or if the  Board  Guarantee  is no  longer  in  effect,  the  Requisite
Lenders),  subject to applicable  law, be applied  against the  obligations  of the Company under
the Loan  Documents.  At such time as there shall not be continuing  any such  Specified  Default
or Event of  Default,  such  amount  shall be paid to the  Company to the  extent not  previously
applied in  accordance  with the  preceding  sentence.  Prior to remitting  any such funds to the
Company,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  be  authorized  to  request  and  receive  an  Officer's
Certificate  from the  Company  certifying  that no  Specified  Default or Event of  Default  has
occurred and is continuing.

(f)      <u>Treatment  of  Insurance  Proceeds in  Accordance  with Loan  Agreement</u>.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein,  any insurance proceeds and any proceeds received in
connection with a requisition of title by any Governmental Authority payable to the Company or the
loss payee as a result of an Event of Loss with respect to all or any  portion of the Collateral
shall be subject to Section 2.6(c) of the Loan  Agreement (including the threshold set forth in the
first sentence thereof for proceeds not applied to repair, restore or replace the asset from which
such proceeds  derived)  without  regard to whether the Company  elects  pursuant to this SECTION
3.01 to  substitute  an  Acceptable  Alternate  Spare Engine in respect of the Spare Engine which
has suffered an Event of Loss.

                                            REMEDIES</b>

SECTION 4.01      <u>REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COLLATERAL AGENT</u>.

(a)      For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under this Security Agreement,
after an Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as such Event of Default shall be continuing:
(i) upon the written demand of the  Collateral  Agent and at the Company's  expense,  the Company
shall give the Collateral  Agent immediate  access to the Tracking System  (together with Company
personnel  necessary  to operate the  Tracking  System) and promptly  deliver  possession  of any
Collateral as the Collateral  Agent may so demand to the Collateral  Agent or its designee in the
manner and condition  required by, and otherwise in accordance  with all the  provisions of, this
Security  Agreement,  or the Collateral Agent at its option may enter upon the premises where all
or any part of the  Collateral  is located and take  immediate  possession of and remove the same
by summary  proceedings  or otherwise (and at the Collateral  Agent's  option,  store the same at
the Company's  premises until disposal thereof by the Collateral  Agent),  all without  liability
accruing  to the  Collateral  Agent  (other than that caused by the  Collateral  Agent's  willful
misconduct  or gross  negligence as actually and finally  determined  by a final,  non-appealable
judgment  of a court of  competent  jurisdiction)  for or by  reason  of such  entry or taking of
possession or removing  whether for the  restoration of damage to property  caused by such action
or  otherwise;  and (ii) the Company  shall,  at the request of the  Collateral  Agent,  promptly
execute  and  deliver to the  Collateral  Agent such  instruments  or other  documents  as may be
necessary or advisable to enable the Collateral  Agent or an agent or  representative  designated
by the Collateral  Agent,  at such time or times and place or places as the Collateral  Agent may
specify,  to obtain  possession of all or any part of the  Collateral the possession of which the
Collateral  Agent shall at the time be entitled to  hereunder;  <u>provided</u>,  that during any period
any  aircraft on which a Spare  Engine is  installed  is  activated  under the Civil  Reserve Air
Fleet  Program in  accordance  with the  provisions  of SECTION  2.01(B)(I)(F)  hereof and in the
possession  of the  government of the United  States of America or an  instrumentality  or agency
thereof,  the  Collateral  Agent shall not,  on account of any Event of  Default,  be entitled to
exercise any of its rights under this  SECTION 4.01 against the  Collateral  in such manner as to
limit the  Company's  control of the  associated  aircraft,  unless at least sixty (60) days' (or
such  lesser  period as may then be  applicable  under the Air  Mobility  Command  program of the
United States  Government)  prior written  notice of Default  hereunder  shall have been given by
the  Collateral  Agent  to  the  Company  with  a  copy  addressed  to  the  Contracting   Office
Representative  for the Air  Mobility  Command of the United  States Air Force under the contract
with the Company relating to such aircraft.

(b)      After an Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as such Event of Default shall
be continuing, then and in every such case the Collateral Agent, as holder of a security interest
in the Collateral may, and when required pursuant to the provisions of Section  7.2 of the Loan
Agreement  shall,  exercise,  any or all of the  rights  and powers and pursue any and all of the
remedies  accorded  to a secured  party  under the UCC and under any other  applicable  law,  may
recover  judgment  in its own  name as  Collateral  Agent  against  the  Collateral  and may take
possession  of all or any part of the  Collateral  and may  exclude  the  Company and all Persons
claiming  under any of them  wholly or partly  therefrom.  Any  proceeds  received or realized by
the  Collateral  Agent at any time  pursuant  to the  exercise  of  remedies  hereunder  shall be
promptly  transferred  by the Collateral  Agent to the account of the Agent  specified in Section
2.9(a) of the Loan  Agreement for  application  in  accordance  with the priority of payments set
forth in Section 2.9(e) of the Loan Agreement.

(c)      So long as an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent
may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any mandatory
legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, and either before or after  taking
possession  and without  instituting  any legal  proceedings  whatsoever,  and having first given
notice of such sale by  registered  mail to the  Company,  at least 20 days  prior to the date of
such  sale,  and any  other  notice  which  may be  required  by law,  sell  and  dispose  of the
Collateral,  or any part thereof,  or interest therein, at public auction or private sale, in one
lot as an  entirety or in  separate  lots,  and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as
the Collateral  Agent may  determine,  and at any place (whether or not it be the location of the
Collateral or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred to.

(d)      Any such sale may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place
appointed for such sale, or for any such adjourned sale, without further notice, and the Collateral
Agent or any Lender may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale and each Lender shall be entitled
at any public  auction sale to credit  against any purchase price bid at such public auction sale
by such  Lender all or any part of any unpaid  obligations  owing to such  Lender  secured by the
Lien of the Security Documents.

(e)      If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Agent shall also be
entitled to pursue all or any part of the Collateral wherever it may be found and may enter any of the
premises of the Company or any other Person  wherever the  Collateral may be or be supposed to be
and search for the  Collateral  and take  possession  of any item of the  Collateral  pursuant to
this  SECTION  4.01(E).  The  Collateral  Agent  may,  from time to time,  at the  expense of the
Company,  make  all  such  expenditures  for the  collection,  maintenance,  insurance,  repairs,
replacements,  alterations,  additions and improvements to and of the Collateral,  as it may deem
proper.  In each such case,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall have the right to  collect,  maintain,
use, insure,  operate,  store, lease, control or manage the Collateral,  and to carry on business
and exercise all rights and powers of the Company  relating to the  Collateral as the  Collateral
Agent  shall deem  appropriate,  including  the right to enter  into any and all such  agreements
with  respect to the  collection,  maintenance,  use,  insurance,  operation,  storage,  leasing,
control or  management  of the  Collateral or any part  thereof.  The  Collateral  Agent shall be
entitled  to  collect,  sue for and  receive  directly  all monies due or to become  due,  tolls,
rents,  issues,  profits,  products,  revenues or other income pursuant to this SECTION  4.01(E).
In accordance  with the terms of this SECTION  4.01(E),  such monies due or to become due, tolls,
rents,  issues,  profits,  products,  revenues  and  other  income  shall be  applied  to pay the
expenses  of  collecting,  using,  operating,  storing,  leasing,  controlling  or  managing  the
Collateral, and of all maintenance,  insurance,  repairs,  replacements,  alterations,  additions
and  improvements,  and to make all payments  which the  Collateral  Agent may be required or may
elect to make,  if any,  for taxes,  assessments,  insurance  or other  proper  charges  upon the
Collateral  or any part thereof  (including  the  employment  of  engineers  and  accountants  to
examine,  inspect and make reports  upon the  properties  and books and records of the  Company),
and all other  payments  which the  Collateral  Agent may be required or authorized to make under
any provision of this Security  Agreement,  including this SECTION  4.01(E),  as well as just and
reasonable  compensation  for the services of the Collateral  Agent,  and of all persons properly
engaged and employed by the Collateral Agent.

(f)      Subject to SECTION 4.01(C), the Collateral Agent may proceed to protect and enforce this
Security Agreement by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in execution or aid
of any power herein granted; or for foreclosure  hereunder,  or for the appointment of a receiver
or receivers  for the  Collateral  or any part  thereof,  or for the recovery of judgment for the
indebtedness  secured by the Lien created  under this Security  Agreement or for the  enforcement
of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.

(g)      Each and every right, power and remedy herein given to the Collateral Agent specifically
or otherwise in this Security Agreement shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity
or by statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically  herein  given or
otherwise  existing  may be  exercised  from  time to time and as  often in such  order as may be
deemed  expedient by the Collateral  Agent,  and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of
any power or remedy  shall not be  construed  to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same
time or  thereafter  any other  right,  power or remedy.  No delay or omission by the  Collateral
Agent in the  exercise of any right,  remedy or power or in pursuing  any remedy shall impair any
such  right,  power or remedy or be  construed  to be a waiver of any  default on the part of the
Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(h)      Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default the Collateral Agent shall be
entitled to undertake an acceptance of all or a part of the Collateral in satisfaction of all or a
specified part of the  Obligations  pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Sections
9-620 and 9-621 of the UCC and the Company's rights  thereunder,  none of which are waived herein
notwithstanding  the terms of SECTION  4.03,  and, if pursuant  to such  Sections  and after such
Event  of  Default  the  Company  consents  to  such  acceptance,  which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld,  then the Company  shall  execute and deliver  such deeds of  conveyance,
assignments  and other  documents or instruments  (including any notices or  applications  to the
FAA or any other Governmental  Authority having  jurisdiction over the Collateral subject to such
conveyance)  as shall be  reasonably  required to  effectuate  the  transfer of such  Collateral,
together  with the  certificates,  if any,  representing  the same and any  other  rights  of the
Company with respect thereto,  to the Collateral  Agent or any designee or designees  selected by
the Collateral Agent.

SECTION 4.02      <u>EXPENSES</u>.  The Company agrees that it will upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent:

(a)      the amount of any taxes (other than income taxes) payable by reason of the Collateral Agent's
security interests in respect of the Collateral or to free any of the Collateral from any Lien thereon;
and

(b)      the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, but not limited to,
any excise, property, transfer, sales and use taxes imposed by any state, federal or other local
authority on any of the Collateral, and reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and of any other
experts payable in connection  with the  enforcement of this Security  Agreement after and during
the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  including such expenses as are incurred in connection
with:

(i)      the collection, sale or other disposition of the Collateral;
(ii)     any action taken by the Collateral Agent to effect compliance on behalf of the Company in
         respect of a failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of this Security Agreement

instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Security Agreement by
foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned
for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Collateral Agent, then and in every
such case the Company, the Collateral  Agent and each  Lender  shall be  restored  to their  former
positions and rights  hereunder with respect to the Collateral  subject to the security  interest

SECTION 6.05      <u>DOCUMENTATION</u>.  The Company shall provide the Collateral Agent with copies

that is other than an Interest Payment Date may, in lieu of being paid by the Company as a prepayment
on the due date thereof, be deposited in the Prepayment Account if, by virtue of such prepayment,
the Company would be obligated to make a payment in accordance with  Section  2.10(e) of the Loan

provided in the preceding  sentence,  the  Collateral  Agent shall apply any amounts so deposited
in the  Prepayment  Account  to  prepay  the Loans on the last day of the then  current  Interest

parties hereby  acknowledge  and agree that the  Prepayment  Account is, and is intended to be, a
deposit  account (as such term is defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC),  and that the  Collateral
Agent  shall at all times  during the term of this  Agreement  have  control  of such  Prepayment
Account (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC).

SECTION 6.07      <u>CASH COLLATERAL</u>.

(a)      Any amounts held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
shall be invested by the Collateral Agent from time to time in Cash Equivalents as directed in an
Officer's Certificate from the Company so long as the Collateral Agent may acquire the same using
commercially  reasonable  efforts.  The parties hereto agree that the Collateral  Agent and/or an
Affiliate of the  Collateral  Agent may charge  and/or  collect  fees and expenses in  connection
with the  purchase of Cash  Equivalents  or for other  services  rendered  to the parties  hereto
(<u>provided</u> that such charges, fees and expenses are on terms consistent with terms negotiated at
arm's  length).  Neither  the  Collateral  Agent nor any of its  Affiliates  shall be required to

provided in SECTION  6.06,  any income  realized as a result of any such  investment,  net of the
Collateral  Agent's  reasonable  fees and expenses in making such  investment,  shall be held and
applied by the  Collateral  Agent in the same manner as the principal  amount of such  investment
is to be applied and any losses,  net of earnings and such  reasonable  fees and expenses,  shall
be charged against the principal  amount  invested.  All taxes on any income so realized shall be
charged to the Company.  The  Collateral  Agent shall not be liable for any loss  resulting  from
any  investment  to be made by it under  this  Agreement  other  than by  reason  of its  willful
misconduct  or gross  negligence as actually and finally  determined  in a final,  non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(b)      Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its Affiliates assume any duty or liability for
monitoring the rating of the selected investment. In the event an investment selection is not made,
the amounts held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Security  Agreement
shall not be invested  and the  Collateral  Agent shall not incur any  liability  for interest or
income thereon.

(c)      The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest amounts to be held by
the Collateral Agent if all or a portion of such amounts are deposited with the Collateral Agent
after 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the day of the deposit.  Instructions to invest or reinvest that
are received after 11:00 a.m. (New York time) will be treated  as if  received  on the  following
Business Day in New York.

of this Security Agreement or as otherwise contemplated in this Security Agreement. Requests or
instructions  received  after 11:00 a.m.  (New York time) by the  Collateral  Agent to  liquidate
such amounts will be treated as if received on the following Business Day in New York.

(e)      The Collateral Agent shall have no responsibility for any investment losses resulting from
the investment, reinvestment or liquidation of the amounts held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to
the  terms  of this  Security  Agreement  <u>provided</u>  that  the  Collateral  Agent  has  made  such
investment,  reinvestment  or liquidation of the trust assets in accordance  with the terms,  and
subject to the conditions, of this Security Agreement.

(f)      Each of the parties to this Security Agreement acknowledge that non-deposit investment products
are not obligations of, or guaranteed by, Wells Fargo Bank,  N.A. or any of their affiliates; are not
FDIC  insured;  and are subject to  investment  risks,  including  the possible loss of principal
amount  invested in one of the money market  funds made  available  by the  Collateral  Agent and
selected by the Company.

(g)      Any investment direction contained herein may be executed through an affiliated broker or
dealer of the Collateral Agent and any such affiliated broker or dealer shall be entitled to such
broker's or dealer's usual and customary fees for such execution.

(h)      The Cash Equivalents may be held by the Collateral Agent directly or through any clearing
agency or depository  (collectively, the "<u>Clearing Agency</u>") including, without limitation,
the Federal Reserve/Treasury  Book-Entry  System for United  States and federal  agency  securities,
and The Depository  Trust Company.  The Collateral Agent shall not have any responsibility or liability
for the actions or omissions to act on the part of any Clearing Agency.

(i)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby agree
and acknowledge  that due to the  potential  conflict  of  interest,  the  Collateral  Agent will not
purchase  the  commercial  paper  of Wells  Fargo  Bank,  N.A.  or any  affiliate  (collectively,
"Paper")  unless  the  Collateral  Agent  is  specifically  instructed  to  purchase  Paper in an
Officer's  Certificate from the Company.  Any instruction for the purchase of Paper must be given
by the Company on a  transaction  by  transaction  basis in the manner set forth in the preceding
sentence.
