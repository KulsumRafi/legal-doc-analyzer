          an Employee is eligible to participate in this Plan (which shall not

          such as severance pay, but shall include vacation time earned but no
          yet paid as of that last date at work), total compensation paid to an
          Employee by the Employer that is includable in the Participant's gross
          income, including bonuses, commissions and overtime, but excluding (i)

          welfare benefits, and (vi) amounts realized from the exercise of a

          restricted stock) or the sale or exchange of stock acquired under a
          qualified stock option. Despite the exclusions in the preceding
          sentence, Compensation shall include any amounts deducted pursuant to
