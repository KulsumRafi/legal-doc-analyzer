         perform and discharge to the Security Trustee the Secured Obligations
         in the manner provided for in the Finance Documents.

3.2      INTEREST

         Save to the extent that the Agent or any of the Lenders is otherwise
         entitled to do so under the Agreement, interest may be added by the
         Security Trustee to any of the Secured Obligations which shall remain
         unpaid on the due date for payment, from such date until payment
         (whether before, on or at any time after demand or judgment or the
         liquidation of any Charging Company) at the rate of 2% per annum above
         the Reference Rate for the time being of the Agent on the sterling
         equivalent of the amount of such Secured Obligations which interest may
         be compounded (whether before, on or at any time after demand or
         judgment or the liquidation of any Charging Company), by the Security
         Trustee with monthly rests to the extent that it shall remain unpaid.

4        GUARANTEE

4.1      GUARANTEE

         Each Charging Company unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
         Security Trustee the due and punctual payment, performance and
         discharge by each other Obligor of the Secured Obligations. If and
         whenever any Obligor shall default in the payment, performance or
         discharge of any of the Secured Obligations, each Charging Company
         shall, upon written demand by the Security Trustee, promptly pay,
         perform or discharge the Secured Obligations in respect of which such
         default has been made.

4.2      INDEMNITY

         Each Charging Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
         Security Trustee for and on behalf of the Beneficiaries from time to
         time on demand from and against any loss incurred by any Beneficiary as
         a result of any of the Secured Obligations being or becoming void,
         voidable or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, whether known to
         the Security Trustee or not.

4.3      CONTINUING SECURITY

         The obligations of each Charging Company under this Debenture are
         continuing obligations and shall remain in force until all of the
         Secured Obligations have been satisfied in full. The obligations of
         each Charging Company under this Debenture shall not be (or be
         construed so as to be) satisfied by any intermediate discharge or
         payment of or on account of any of the Secured Obligations or any
         settlement of account between the Security Trustee and any other
         Beneficiary, any Charging Company or any other Obligor or any other
         person, or any other matter (other than the discharge in full of the
         Secured Obligations).

4.4      PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS

         Neither the obligations of any Charging Company nor the rights and
         remedies of the Beneficiaries under any of the Finance Documents or
         otherwise conferred by law shall be discharged, prejudiced or impaired
         by reason of:

         4.4.1    any variation of any of the Secured Obligations or of the
                  terms or conditions of any of the Finance Documents or of any
                  encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance held or to be held
                  as security for the payment, performance or discharge of any
                  of the Secured Obligations (any such encumbrance, guarantee or
                  other assurance together referred to in this clause 4 as
                  "RELATED SECURITY");

         4.4.2    any failure on the part of the Security Trustee (whether
                  intentional or not) to take, perfect or realise (whether in
                  full or in part) the security constituted or intended to be
                  constituted by this Debenture or any related security now or
                  in the future agreed to be taken in respect of any of the
                  Secured Obligations;

         4.4.3    any incapacity or change in the constitution of any party to
                  any of the Finance Documents or to any related security;

         4.4.4    any of the Secured Obligations or any obligation of any person
                  under any of the Finance Documents or under any related
                  security being or becoming invalid, illegal, void or
                  unenforceable for any reason;

         4.4.5    any time or other indulgence given or agreed to be given to,
                  or any composition or other arrangement made with or accepted
                  from, any Charging Company or any other Obligor in respect of
                  any of the Secured Obligations or any other person in respect
                  of any of its obligations under any related security;

         4.4.6    any waiver or release of any of the Secured Obligations or of
                  any obligation of any person under any related security or any
                  failure to realise, in full or in part, the value of, or any
                  discharge or exchange of the security constituted or intended
                  to be constituted by this Debenture or any related security;

         4.4.7    any Charging Company, any other Obligor or any other person
                  party to any of the Finance Documents or any related security
                  being wound up, going into administration or liquidation or
                  making any composition or arrangement with its creditors
                  (whether or not sanctioned by the court and whether or not the
                  Beneficiaries have agreed to such compromise or arrangement)
                  and so that where, by virtue of any compromise or arrangement,
                  any of the Secured Obligations are transferred to any other
                  person, the guarantee and indemnity of each Charging Company
                  contained in this Debenture shall take effect as if the term
                  "CHARGING COMPANY" included such other person; or

                                       9
<PAGE>

         4.4.8    any other act, event or omission which, but for this
                  provision, would or might operate to offer any legal or
                  equitable defence for or impair or discharge any of the
                  Secured Obligations or any obligation of any person under any
                  related security or prejudicially affect the rights or
                  remedies of the Security Trustee under this Debenture or
                  otherwise conferred by law.

4.5      INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS

         The obligations of each Charging Company under this Debenture are
         additional to, and not in substitution for, any related security and
         the obligations assumed by such Charging Company under this Debenture
         may be enforced without first having recourse to any related security
         and without making or filing any claim or proof in a winding-up or
         dissolution of any other Charging Company or any other person party to
         any of the Finance Documents or any related security or first taking
         any steps or proceedings against any other Charging Company, any other
         Obligor or any such person.

4.6      NON-COMPETITION

         Until all of the Secured Obligations have been satisfied in full and
         none of the Beneficiaries are under any further obligation, actual or
         contingent, to any Obligor, no Charging Company shall:

         4.6.1    exercise any right of subrogation, indemnity, set-off or
                  counterclaim against any other Charging Company, any other
                  Obligor or any person party to any related security;

         4.6.2    claim payment of any other monies for the time being due to it
                  by any other Charging Company, any other Obligor or any person
                  party to any related security by reason of the performance by
                  it of its obligations under any of the Finance Documents or
                  under any related security or on any account whatsoever or
                  exercise any other right or remedy or enforce any encumbrance,
                  guarantee or other assurance which it has in respect thereof;

         4.6.3    claim any contribution from any other Charging Company, any
                  other Obligor or any other person party to any of the Finance
                  Documents or any related security;

         4.6.4    negotiate, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of any monies,
                  obligations or liabilities now or at any future time due or
                  owing to it by any other Charging Company, any other Obligor
                  or any person party to any related security or any
                  encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance in respect thereof;
                  or

         4.6.5    claim or prove in a winding-up or dissolution of any other
                  Charging Company, any other Obligor or any other person party
                  to any of the Finance Documents or any related security in
                  competition with the Security Trustee or any Beneficiary; and

                                       10
<PAGE>

         if any Charging Company receives any sums in contravention of this
         clause 4.6, it shall hold them on trust to be applied promptly in or
         towards the satisfaction of the Secured Obligations.

4.7      NO SECURITY

         Each Charging Company warrants that it has not taken, and agrees that
         it will not take, from any other Charging Company, any other Obligor or
         any person party to any related security, any encumbrance, guarantee or
         other assurance in respect of or in connection with its obligations
         under this Debenture. If any Charging Company takes any such
         encumbrance, guarantee or other assurance in contravention of this
         clause, it shall hold it on trust for the Security Trustee until such
         time as all of the Secured Obligations have been satisfied in full (and
         no Beneficiary is under any further obligation, actual or contingent,
         to any Obligor) and shall on request promptly deposit the same with
         and/or charge the same to the Security Trustee in such manner as the
         Security Trustee may require as security for the due and punctual
         payment, performance and discharge by such Charging Company of the
         Secured Obligations.

4.8      SUSPENSE ACCOUNT

         If any Charging Company is wound up, goes into liquidation or makes any
         composition or arrangement with its creditors, neither the existence of
         this Debenture nor any monies received or recovered by the Security
         Trustee under or pursuant to this Debenture shall impair the right of
         any Beneficiary to prove in such winding-up, liquidation, composition
         or arrangement for the total amount due from such Charging Company or
         any other Obligor. The Security Trustee may at any time and from time
         to time place and, for so long as it thinks fit, keep any monies
         received or recovered under this Debenture in a separate or suspense
         account, in such name as it thinks fit, without any intermediate
         obligation on its part to apply the same in or towards discharge of the
         Secured Obligations provided that if such monies are at any time
         sufficient to discharge the Secured Obligations in full they shall
         promptly be so applied.

5        ADDITIONAL CHARGING COMPANIES

5.1      REQUIREMENT

         The parties to this Debenture acknowledge that the Agent may require
         that any Group Company (which is not then a Charging Company) shall
         become a Charging Company, by giving to Ideal not less than 10 business
         days' notice, provided that any Group Company which accedes to the
         Agreement as an Additional Borrower shall, unless the Agent otherwise
         agrees, automatically be required to become a Charging Company without
         the need for the Agent to serve any such notice upon Ideal.

5.2      ACCESSION

         Any Group Company in respect of whom a notice has been served to Ideal
         (or, in the case of an acceding Additional Borrower, in respect of whom
         a notice is

                                       11
<PAGE>

         deemed to have been served) as contemplated by clause 5.1, shall be
         required to and shall become, a Charging Company:

         5.2.1    (other than in the case of a Group Company which accedes to
                  the Agreement as an Additional Borrower (in which case,
                  accession as a Charging Company shall, unless the Agent
                  otherwise agrees, be mandatory)), if the Lenders require the
                  addition of that Group Company as a Charging Company;

         5.2.2    upon Ideal delivering to the Security Trustee (through the
                  Agent) a duly completed and executed Supplemental Deed, which
                  Ideal shall be required to do not later than 30 days after
                  receipt (or deemed receipt) of a notice from the Agent
                  pursuant to clause 5.1;

         5.2.3    if no Default has occurred or is likely to occur as a result
                  of that Group Company becoming a Charging Company; and

         5.2.4    if the Agent has received all of the documents and other
                  evidence in relation to that Group Company specified in
                  Schedule 10 (which shall be required to be delivered to the
                  Agent within 60 days of receipt (or deemed receipt) by Ideal
                  of a notice under clause 5.1) and each is in form and
                  substance satisfactory to the Agent.

5.3      TIMING

         The Security Trustee (through the Agent) shall notify Ideal and each of
         the Beneficiaries promptly upon being satisfied that it has received
         all of the documents and other evidence specified in Schedule 10 and
         that such is in form and substance satisfactory to it, whereupon
         subject always to clauses 5.2.1 to 5.2.3 (inclusive), the relevant
         Group Company shall become a Charging Company.

5.4      IDEAL AS AGENT

         Each Charging Company shall be deemed to appoint Ideal as its agent for
         the purposes of the Finance Documents (including this Debenture) by its
         execution of a Supplemental Deed. The Security Trustee may rely on a
         document signed by Ideal as if it had been signed by each other
         Charging Company. Ideal may give a good receipt for any sum payable by
         any Finance Party to each other Charging Company. Any communication
         delivered to Ideal shall be deemed to have been delivered to each of
         the Charging Companies. Any communication made by Ideal to the Agent or
         the Security Trustee (through the Agent) shall, to the extent
         permissible by law, be deemed to have been made with the consent of
         each other Charging Company.

5.5      REPETITION OF REPRESENTATIONS

         Delivery of a Supplemental Deed constitutes confirmation by the
         relevant Charging Company that the representations and warranties set
         out in clause 14.1 of the Agreement which are required to be repeated
         pursuant to clause 14.3 of that Agreement are true and correct in all
         material respects in

         relation to that Charging Company as at the date of delivery of such
         Supplemental Deed as if made by reference to the facts and
         circumstances then existing.

                  any of its Receivables to the rights of any other person in
                  relation to debts owed to such person or otherwise deal with
                  its Receivables in favour of any person (nor, in each such
                  case, purport to do so) save in the ordinary course of its
                  business and, in any event, not sell, assign, factor, discount
                  or otherwise charge its Receivables in favour of any person,
                  nor purport to do so;

         8.2      PERFECTION OF ASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES: at any time after the
                  occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing and at
                  any other time when it is requested to do so by the Security
                  Trustee and without prejudice to the generality of clause 12.1
                  take such steps as the Security Trustee may require to perfect
                  the assignment of its Receivables and each Receivables Account
                  assigned pursuant to clause 2.3 including, without prejudice
                  to the generality of the foregoing and without prejudice to
                  the Security Trustee's right to do so, giving notice of any
                  such assignment to any of the persons (as the Security Trustee
                  shall specify) from whom its Receivables are due, owing or
                  incurred by delivery to each such person of a Notice of
                  Assignment duly executed by such Charging Company and use all
                  reasonable endeavours to procure that each such person
                  delivers to the Security Trustee (if the Security Trustee so
                  requires) a written acknowledgement substantially in the form
                  of the acknowledgement and agreement attached to the Notice of
                  Assignment;

         8.3      DESIGNATED ACCOUNTS: unless and until the Security Trustee
                  otherwise agrees in writing, pay or procure the payment of the
                  proceeds of its Receivables into a Receivables Account and so
                  that such Charging Company hereby declares itself trustee of
                  the proceeds of any such Receivables not from time to time so
                  paid to hold the same upon trust for the Security Trustee to
                  pay the same to the Security Trustee in or towards payment and
                  discharge of the Secured Obligations in such order and manner
                  as the Security Trustee may in its absolute and unfettered
                  discretion from time to time conclusively determine and not
                  make any withdrawal or direct

                                       19
<PAGE>

                  or permit any payment to be made from any Receivables Account
                  save as permitted under the Agreement and this Debenture. All
                  proceeds received by a Charging Company or by the Security
                  Trustee directly or paid into a Receivables Account shall be
                  the subject of the security constituted by this Debenture and
                  shall be subject to the sole control of the Security Trustee
                  and withdrawals by a Charging Company from a Receivables
                  Account shall not be permitted without the prior written
                  consent of the Security Trustee. The Security Trustee shall be
                  entitled, in its sole discretion, to permit the withdrawal by
                  each Charging Company of any and all credit balances from time
                  to time standing to the credit of any Receivables Account and
                  the Charging Companies shall use such monies only for their
                  corporate and business purposes in the ordinary course of
                  trading and, if the Security Trustee permits such withdrawals,
                  the Security Trustee agrees to issue to the bank at which such
                  Receivables Account may be held (if not the Security Trustee),
                  any directions or instructions reasonably necessary to permit
                  such withdrawals to be effected. The Security Trustee shall
                  not be obliged to permit any withdrawals or to issue any such
                  directions in accordance with this clause 8.3. The Charging
                  Companies and the Security Trustee acknowledge and agree that
                  unless the Security Trustee otherwise requires or directs,
                  prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
                  continuing the credit balance standing to the credit of the
                  Receivables Accounts at the end of each business day shall
                  automatically be transferred to the Agent for application in
                  or towards the discharge of the then Outstandings, such
                  transfer to occur on the immediately following business day.
                  The relevant Charging Company will give an instruction to that
                  effect to the relevant bank at which such Receivables Account
                  is held.

         8.4      ACCOUNT NOTICE: promptly upon opening a Receivables Account,
                  deliver an Account Notice duly executed by such Charging
                  Company to the entity with which the relevant account is
                  maintained and use reasonable endeavours procure that such
                  entity delivers to the Security Trustee a written
                  acknowledgement substantially in the form of the
                  acknowledgement and agreement attached to the Account Notice;
                  and

         8.5      SALES OF INVENTORY FOR CASH: if sales of Inventory are made or
                  services are rendered for cash, the Charging Company shall
                  immediately pay into a Receivables Account denominated in the
                  currency of such Receivables the identical cheques, cash or
                  other forms of payment which it receives.

                                       20
<PAGE>

         authorised, to procure such compliance), comply with (or procure
         compliance with) all obligations as to insurance imposed by the terms
         of any prior mortgage or charge, lease, agreement for lease, tenancy or
         other binding contract comprised in and/or affecting any of the
         Property or under which such Charging Company derives its title or
         interest to any relevant Collateral and, subject to the foregoing and
         so far as not inconsistent with the said terms, such Charging Company
         shall:

         9.1.1    insure and keep insured its Property and all Equipment and
                  Inventory forming part of the Collateral with insurers
                  previously approved by the Security Trustee in writing against
                  loss or damage by fire, explosion, storm, tempest, lightning,
                  earthquake, impact, aircraft and articles dropped therefrom,
                  riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, bursting and/or
                  over-flowing pipes and such other risks and contingencies as
                  the Security Trustee shall from time to time reasonably
                  require;

         9.1.2    maintain such other insurances as are normally maintained by
                  prudent companies carrying on similar business (including
                  public liability insurance, employees' liability insurance and
                  credit insurance);

         9.1.3    effect all insurances pursuant to clause 9.1.1 with the
                  interest of the Security Trustee as loss payee endorsed on the
                  relevant Policy in which it is interested and, if the Security
                  Trustee so requires, with the Security Trustee named as
                  co-insured;

         9.1.4    punctually pay all premiums and other sums payable under or in
                  relation to each Policy in which it is interested and
                  promptly, if the Security Trustee so requests, produce
                  evidence satisfactory to the Security Trustee of such
                  payments;

         9.1.5    not make, do, consent or agree to any act or omission which
                  would or might render any Policy in which it is interested
                  invalid, void, voidable or unenforceable or render any
                  proceeds of any such Policy irrecoverable whether in whole or
                  in part, and not alter the terms of any such Policy (without
                  the prior written consent of the Security Trustee) or allow
                  any such Policy to lapse; and

         9.1.6    without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of
                  clause 7.2.3 and save where any priority arrangements exist
                  between the Security Trustee and any other person and where
                  the Security Trustee otherwise permits, deposit with the
                  Security Trustee and permit the Security Trustee to hold and
                  retain all Policies in which it is interested and to hold on
                  trust for the Security Trustee any such Policies not for the
                  time being so deposited (and such Charging Company hereby
                  declares itself as trustee accordingly).

9.2      RENEWAL OF INSURANCE

         If default shall be made by a Charging Company in complying with clause
         9.1, the Security Trustee may, but shall not be required to, effect or
         renew any such insurance as is mentioned in that clause either in its
         own name or in its name and that of the relevant Charging Company or in
         the name of the relevant Charging Company with an endorsement of the
         Security Trustee's interest. All monies expended by the Security
         Trustee in so effecting or renewing any such insurance shall be
         reimbursed by the relevant Charging Company to the Security Trustee on
         demand and shall carry interest from the date of payment by the
         Security Trustee until so reimbursed at the rate and otherwise as
         mentioned in clause 3.2

9.3      DECLARATION OF TRUST

         Each Charging Company hereby declares itself as trustee of all monies
         not paid directly to the Security Trustee by the insurers in relation
         to any Policy in which it is interested whether or not effected or
         maintained pursuant to the obligations of such Charging Company under
         this clause 9, to hold the same upon trust to be applied in the same
         manner in which the same would have been applied had payment been made
         to the Security Trustee.

9.4      EVENT OF DEFAULT

         On the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, any
         monies paid or payable to the Security Trustee by the insurers in
         relation to any Policy may, on the written instruction of the Majority
         Lenders, be applied in or towards payment and discharge of the Secured
         Obligations.

                  Security Trustee may from time to time require for perfecting
                  its title to such Investments (duly executed by or signed on
                  behalf of the registered holder) or for vesting or enabling it
                  to vest the same in itself or any of its nominees or in any
                  purchaser provided that such a transfer may only be effected
                  by the Security Trustee following the occurrence of an Event
                  of Default which is continuing and, in the event of any such
                  transfer being effected, neither the Security Trustee nor any
                  of its nominees shall be liable for any loss occasioned by any

                  Investments or by any failure to report to such Charging
                  Company any notice or other communication received in respect

                  Security Trustee or its nominees to perfect or enforce the
                  security constituted or intended to be constituted by this
                  Debenture and procure that the board of directors of any
                  company in which any of its Investments are held approves any
                  transfer of any of its Investments desired to be made by the
                  Security Trustee in the exercise of the rights, powers and

                  payment, the Security Trustee may (but shall not be obliged
                  to) pay such amounts on behalf of such Charging Company and

                           attaching to its Investments as it sees fit but in a
                           manner which does not prejudice and is not
                           inconsistent with the security constituted by this
                           Debenture; and

                  (b)      it shall be entitled to receive any and all dividend
                           and interest payments and other distributions
                           accruing on or deriving from such Investments;

         10.1.8   VARIATION OF RIGHTS: not, without the prior written consent of
                  the Security Trustee, by the exercise of any voting rights or

                  any variation of the rights attaching to or conferred by any
                  of its Investments or to any conversion of any of its
                  Investments into an uncertificated security.

10.2     EXERCISE OF VOTING RIGHTS BY SECURITY TRUSTEE AND DIVIDEND ENTITLEMENT

         If any of the Investments of any Charging Company are transferred into
         the name of the Security Trustee or any nominee of the Security
         Trustee, then:

         10.2.1   the Security Trustee shall use all reasonable endeavours to
                  procure that all voting rights attached to such Investments
                  are exercised as such Charging Company shall direct provided
                  that the Security Trustee shall not be obliged to comply with
                  such Charging Company's directions if, as a result, such
                  voting rights would be exercised in any manner which (a) is
                  inconsistent with the security constituted or intended to be
                  constituted by this Debenture or (b) is in breach of any
                  provision of any of the Finance Documents or (c) would or
                  might result in permission or agreement being given to any
                  compromise, capital reorganisation, conversion, exchange,
                  repayment or takeover offer affecting or in respect of any of
                  such Investments or to any variation of the rights attaching
                  to or conferred by any of such Investments; and

         10.2.2   any and all dividend and interest payments and other
                  distributions accruing on or deriving from such Investments
                  shall be paid to such Charging Company.

10.3     DIVIDENDS AND VOTING RIGHTS FOLLOWING ENFORCEMENT

         On or at any time after the Security Trustee becomes entitled to
         appoint any person or persons to be a Receiver of any of the
         Collateral, the Security Trustee (or any of its nominee(s)) or any
         Receiver shall, on notice in writing to any of the Charging Companies,
         have the right (a) to exercise (or direct the exercise of) any and all
         voting rights attaching to any of the Investments of such Charging
         Company in such manner as any such person so acting shall in its sole
         discretion think fit and (b) to receive, retain and give a good
         discharge for any and all payments falling due in respect of dividends
         or other

                                       24
<PAGE>

         distributions of profits or capital on or arising from any of such
         Investments notwithstanding that they may have accrued in respect of a
         period prior to the time at which the security constituted by this
         Debenture shall have become enforceable.

11       NEGATIVE PLEDGE

         Each Charging Company agrees that it will not, save as permitted under
         the Agreement or this Debenture:

         11.1     ENCUMBRANCES: save in respect of which any priority
                  arrangements exist between the Security Trustee and any other

                  the Collateral or any interest therein ranking in priority to,

         11.2     DISPOSALS: sell, transfer, assign, lease out, lend or

                  grant any rights (whether of pre-emption or otherwise) over,
                  the Collateral or any interest therein nor enter into any
                  agreement to do any of the same (save in the ordinary course
                  of its operations in the case of assets of such Charging
                  Company charged by this Debenture by way of floating charge
                  only).

12       FURTHER ASSURANCE AND PERFECTION OF SECURITY

12.1     FURTHER ASSURANCE

12.1.1   Each Charging Company shall forthwith deliver to the Security Trustee
         or procure the delivery to the Security Trustee of Notices of
         Assignment duly executed by such Charging Company in respect of the
         Policies listed in Schedule 3 and set opposite its name and such
         further Policies as the Security Trustee may direct and shall use
         reasonable endeavours procure that each of the insurers liable on such
         Policies delivers to the Security Trustee a written acknowledgement
         substantially in the form of the acknowledgement and agreement attached
         to each such Notice of Assignment.

12.1.2   Each Charging Company shall execute in favour of the Security Trustee,
         or as the Security Trustee may otherwise direct, such further
         assignments, transfers, mortgages, charges or other encumbrances as in
         each such case the Security Trustee shall stipulate over the Collateral
         for the purpose of more effectively providing security for the payment,
         performance and discharge of the Secured Obligations or of enabling the
         Security Trustee to vest any of the Collateral in the Security Trustee
         or its nominee(s).

12.1.3   The assignments, transfers, mortgages, charges or other encumbrances
         referred to in clause 12.1.2 shall be in such form and contain such
         provisions as the Security Trustee requires. The obligations of each
         Charging Company under clause 12.1.2 and this clause 12.1.3 shall be in
         addition to and not in

                                       25

         substitution for the covenants for further assurance deemed to be

         Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994.

12.1.4   Each Charging Company shall, whenever requested by the Security Trustee
         and at such Charging Company's cost, affix to such of the Collateral or
         endorse or cause to be endorsed on such documents as the Security
         Trustee shall in each case stipulate, labels, signs or memoranda in
         such form as the Security Trustee shall require (but not so as to
         impede or restrict the normal use or operation thereof) referring or
         drawing attention to the security constituted or intended to be
         constituted by this Debenture.

12.2     CONVERSION OF FLOATING CHARGE

12.2.1   Without prejudice to the security constituted or intended to be
         constituted by this Debenture, the Security Trustee may at any time by
         notice in writing to any Charging Company convert the floating charge
         created by such Charging Company pursuant to clause 2.2 with immediate
         effect into a specific charge as regards any of the Collateral of such
         Charging Company specified in the notice:

         (a)      at any time after the Security Trustee becomes entitled to
                  appoint a Receiver notwithstanding it may elect not to do so;
                  or

         (b)      if the Security Trustee considers such Collateral to be in
                  danger of seizure, distress, attachment, execution, diligence
                  or other legal process or to be otherwise in jeopardy.

12.2.2   The floating charge created by each Charging Company pursuant to clause
         2.2 shall (in addition to the circumstances in which the same will
         occur under general law) automatically be converted into a fixed charge
         in respect of the Collateral subject to such floating charge:

         (a)      upon the presentation of a petition for an administration
                  order to be made in relation to any Charging Company;

         (b)      if any Charging Company fails to comply with its obligations
                  under clause 11;

         (c)      upon any person taking any step with a view to levying
                  distress against any of the Collateral of any Charging Company
                  or any judgement creditor taking any step with a view to
                  enforcing against any of the Collateral of any Charging
                  Company a judgement obtained against such Charging Company
                  whether by a warrant of execution, writ of fieri facias,
                  garnishee order, charging order or otherwise; or

         (d)      if any other floating charge created by any Charging Company
                  crystallises for any reason.

12.2.3   Service by the Security Trustee of a notice pursuant to clause 12.2.1
         in relation to any class of the Collateral of any Charging Company
         shall not be construed

                                       26
<PAGE>

         as a waiver or abandonment of the Security Trustee's right to serve
         similar notices in respect of any other class of the Collateral of that
         or any other Charging Company or its other rights under this Debenture.

12.3     SECURITY IN JEOPARDY

         If at any time it shall appear to the Security Trustee (acting in good
         faith) that any of the Collateral of any Charging Company shall be in
         imminent danger of seizure, distress, attachment, execution, diligence
         or other legal process, or that the security constituted or intended to
         be constituted by this Debenture over such Collateral shall for any
         other reason be in jeopardy, the Security Trustee shall be entitled
         without notice to such Charging Company to take possession of and hold
         the same or to appoint a Receiver of such Collateral. The provisions of
         clause 13 shall govern the appointment, removal and powers of a
         Receiver appointed under this clause 12.3 as if he were a Receiver
         appointed under clause 12.

13       RECEIVER

         13.1.1   any Charging Company requests that a Receiver be appointed; or

         13.1.2   the Security Trustee becomes aware of the intention of any
                  party to petition for an administration order to be made in
                  relation to any Charging Company or any such petition is
                  presented; or

         13.1.3   any Charging Company fails duly and punctually to perform or
                  discharge any of the Secured Obligations or any Event of
                  Default occurs and is continuing under the Agreement,

         then at any time or times thereafter the Security Trustee may by
         writing appoint any person or persons to be a Receiver of any of the
         Collateral of any of the Charging Companies and of the rights of the
         Security Trustee contained in this Debenture in relation thereto.

13.2     JOINT RECEIVERS

         Where two or more persons are appointed to be a Receiver, the Security
         Trustee may in the appointment declare whether any act required or
         authorised to be done by a Receiver is to be done by any one or more of
         them for the time being holding office and, subject thereto, any such
         persons may act jointly and/or severally.

13.3     GENERAL POWERS OF RECEIVER

         Any Receiver of any of the Collateral of any Charging Company shall

         or other instrument appointing him but notwithstanding the liquidation,
         winding-up, or dissolution

                                       27

         13.3.2   power on behalf and at the cost of such Charging Company and

                  or omit to do anything which such Charging Company could do or
                  omit to do or could have done or omitted to do but for any
                  incapacity or the appointment of a liquidator, administrator

                  Collateral; and

14       VARIATION AND EXTENSION OF STATUTORY POWERS

14.1     STATUTORY POWERS GENERALLY

         The powers conferred on mortgagees or receivers (including
         administrative receivers) by the Act and the Insolvency Act 1986 shall
         apply to this Debenture except insofar as they are expressly or
         impliedly excluded and where there is any ambiguity or conflict between
         the powers contained in the Act and/or the Insolvency Act 1986 and
         those contained in this Debenture the terms of this Debenture shall (so
         far as the law allows) prevail.

14.2     SECURITY TRUSTEE'S POWERS

         The restrictions contained in sections 93 and 103 of the Act shall not
         apply to the security constituted or intended to be constituted by this
         Debenture and the powers contained in section 101 of the Act shall be
         immediately exercisable at any time after the Security Trustee becomes
         entitled to appoint a Receiver pursuant to clause 13.1 and shall be
         varied and extended so that the Security Trustee shall at any such time
         be entitled (without prejudice to any other rights or powers of a
         mortgagee) to exercise any of the powers conferred upon a Receiver by
         clause 13 and shall have the benefit of all the provisions of clause
         13.

14.3     MORTGAGEE IN POSSESSION

         It is agreed and declared that no exercise (whether by the Security
         Trustee or any Receiver) of any of the powers contained in this
         Debenture shall render the Security Trustee or any Receiver liable as
         mortgagee in possession in respect of any of the Collateral of any
         Charging Company or liable for any loss or damage (including, without
         limitation, loss upon realisation of any of the Collateral) save where
         caused by gross negligence or wilful default on the part of the
         Security Trustee or any Receiver.

14.4     PROTECTION FOR THIRD PARTIES

         No third party dealing with the Security Trustee or any Receiver or its
         or his agents shall, whether before, on or after any contract,
         disposition or assurance in relation to any Collateral in such third
         party's favour be concerned to enquire whether the Secured Obligations
         have become payable or whether any power which the Security Trustee or
         any Receiver purports to exercise has become exercisable or whether any
         of the Secured Obligations remain undischarged or to see to the
         application of any money paid to the Security Trustee or any Receiver,
         nor shall any such third party lending any money to a Receiver be
         concerned to enquire as to the propriety or purpose of the exercise of
         such power or as to the application of any money so borrowed.

14.5     DELEGATION

         The Security Trustee or any Receiver may at any time delegate by power
         of attorney or in any other manner to any person or persons any of the
         powers (including the power of attorney contained in clause 16.1),
         authorities and

                                       31
<PAGE>

         discretions which are for the time being exercisable by the Security
         Trustee or any Receiver under this Debenture in relation to the
         Collateral of any Charging Company. Any such delegation may be made
         upon such terms (including power to sub-delegate) and subject to such
         regulations as the Security Trustee or Receiver may think fit. Neither
         the Security Trustee nor any Receiver shall, save for their wilful
         default or gross negligence, be in any way liable or responsible to any
         Charging Company for any loss or damage arising from any act, default,
         omission or misconduct on the part of any such delegate or
         sub-delegate.

14.6     SUSPENSE ACCOUNTS

         The Security Trustee and any Receiver may place and keep (for such time
         as it or he shall consider prudent) any money received, recovered or
         realised from any Charging Company or in relation to any Collateral of
         such Charging Company pursuant to this Debenture in a separate suspense
         account (to the credit of either such Charging Company or the Security
         Trustee as the Security Trustee shall think fit) without any obligation
         to apply the same or any part thereof in or towards the discharge of
         the Secured Obligations provided that if such monies are at any time
         sufficient to discharge the Secured Obligations in full, they shall be
         promptly so applied.

14.7     SECURITY TRUSTEE'S POWER TO REMEDY BREACHES

         If at any time any Charging Company fails to perform any of the
         covenants contained in this Debenture it shall be lawful for the
         Security Trustee, but the Security Trustee shall have no obligation, to
         take such action on behalf of such Charging Company (including, without
         limitation, the payment of money) as may in the Security Trustee's
         reasonable opinion be required to ensure that such covenants are
         performed. Any losses, costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
         Security Trustee in taking such action shall be reimbursed by such
         Charging Company on demand.

15       CONTINUING SECURITY

15.1     SUBSEQUENT CHARGES

15.1.1   If the Security Trustee receives notice (whether actual or
         constructive) of any subsequent encumbrance or other interest affecting
         any of the Collateral of any Charging Company, or of any other matter
         which may cause the security constituted or intended to be constituted
         by this Debenture to cease to be a continuing security the Security
         Trustee, the Agent and the Lenders may open a new account or accounts
         for such Charging Company.

15.1.2   If any of the Security Trustee, the Agent and the Lenders does not open
         a new account for a Charging Company pursuant to clause 15.1.1 then, it
         shall nevertheless be treated as if it had done so at the time when it
         received such notice and as from that time all payments made by or on
         behalf of such Charging Company shall be credited or deemed to have
         been credited to the new account and shall not operate to reduce the
         amount due from such Charging Company at the time when it received such
         notice.

         Security Trustee or any right or remedy of the Security Trustee in
         respect of the same and shall not be in any way prejudiced or affected
         by the invalidity thereof, or by the Security Trustee now or hereafter
         dealing with, exchanging, releasing, modifying or abstaining from
         perfecting or enforcing any of the same, or any rights which it may now

         arising out of or in connection with the Collateral of such Charging
         Company or the security constituted or intended to be constituted by

19       PAYMENTS AND DISCHARGE

19.1     PAYMENT WITHOUT DEDUCTION

         All payments to be made to any person under this Debenture shall be
         made free and clear of and (save as required by law) without any
         deduction for or on account of any tax, withholding, charges, set-off
         or counterclaim. All payments shall be made into such account or
         accounts as the Security Trustee may from time to time specify for that
         purpose.

19.2     GROSS-UP AND TAX RECEIPTS

         If any Charging Company is required by law to make a deduction or
         withholding from any payment made under this Debenture then the sum
         payable by such Charging Company in respect of which such deduction or
         withholding is required to be made shall be increased to the extent
         necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or
         withholding (including any deduction or withholding applicable to
         additional sums payable under this clause), the Security Trustee
         receives and retains (free from any liability in respect of any such
         deduction or withholding) a net sum equal to the sum which it would
         have received and so retained had no such deduction or withholding been
         made or been required to be made. If any Charging Company makes any
         payment under this Debenture in respect of which it is required by law
         to make any deduction or withholding it shall pay the full amount to be
         deducted or withheld to be relevant taxation or other authority within
         the time allowed for such payment under applicable law and shall
         deliver to the Security Trustee (no later than one week after the end
         of the time allowed for such payment under applicable law) an original
         receipt or other appropriate evidence issued by such authority
         evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so required to
         be deducted or withheld from such payment.

19.3     TAX CREDITS

         If any Charging Company makes an increased payment under clause 19.2
         for the account of any person and such person in its sole opinion and
         based on its own interpretation of any relevant laws or regulations
         (but acting in good faith) determines that it has received or been
         granted a credit against or relief or remission for or in respect of
         any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated by reference
         to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such
         person shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so
         without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit,
         relief, remission or payment and, to the extent it is reasonably
         identifiable and quantifiable, as soon as practicable pay to such
         Charging Company an amount equal to such part or all of such credit,
         relief, remission or repayment as can be made available to such
         Charging Company in such a way as to leave such person (after such
         payment) in no better or worse position than it would have been in if
         such Charging Company had not been required to make such deduction or
         withholding. Nothing contained in this clause 19.3 shall interfere with
         the right of a person to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it
         thinks

                                       35
<PAGE>

         fit nor oblige any person to disclose any information in relation to
         its tax affairs or any computation in respect thereof.

19.4     REINSTATEMENT

         Any settlement or discharge under this Debenture between the Security
         Trustee and any Charging Company shall be conditional upon no security
         or payment to the Security Trustee or any Beneficiary by such Charging
         Company or any other person being avoided or set aside or ordered to be
         refunded or reduced by or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation
         and, if such condition is not satisfied, the Security Trustee shall be
         entitled to recover from such Charging Company on demand the value of
         any such security or the amount of any such payment as if such
         settlement or discharge had not occurred.

19.5     RELEASES

         Without prejudice to any of the terms of any of the Finance Documents
         regarding the giving of consents, releases and/or discharges to any
         Charging Company (whether to facilitate any disposition in relation to
         any of the Collateral of any Charging Company or otherwise) the
         Security Trustee shall, at the request and cost of the Charging
         Companies following the irrevocable payment and discharge in full of
         the Secured Obligations (with no Beneficiary being under any further
         obligation, actual or contingent, to any Charging Company) and provided
         that the security constituted by this Debenture shall not have been
         enforced, and the Security Trustee is satisfied that such payment is
         not subject to avoidance or liable to be set aside, refunded or reduced
         as referred to in clause 19.4, duly execute and do all such deeds, acts
         and things as may be necessary to release from the security constituted
         by this Debenture the assets which are then subject to it. Each
         Charging Company agrees that if any of its Investments charged by this
         Debenture are released from such charge, the Security Trustee may
         release securities of the same class and denomination as the
         Investments concerned rather than the identical Investments deposited
         or transferred under this Debenture.

20       CURRENCY

         Any amount received or recovered by the Security Trustee in respect of
         any sum expressed to be due to it (whether for itself or as trustee for
         any other person) from any Charging Company under this Debenture in a
         currency other than the currency (the "CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY") in which
         such sum is so expressed to be due (whether as a result of, or of the
         enforcement of, any judgement or order of a court or tribunal of any
         jurisdiction, the winding-up of a Charging Company or otherwise) shall
         only constitute a discharge to such Charging Company to the extent of
         the amount of the contractual currency that the Security Trustee is
         able, in accordance with its usual practice, to purchase with the
         amount of the currency so received or recovered on the date of receipt
         or recovery (or, if later, the first date on which such purchase is
         practicable). If the amount of the contractual currency so purchased is
         less than the amount of the contractual currency so expressed to be due
         such Charging Company

                                       36
<PAGE>

         shall indemnify the Security Trustee against any loss sustained by it
         as a result, including the cost of making any such purchase.

         charges register relating to the title to any registered land of any

                  that, when distributing sums in accordance with this clause
                  24.3, the Security Trustee will treat any contingent liability

<PAGE>

                  such party receiving sums in respect of a contingent liability
                  shall place such sums on deposit with such bank (not being a
                  bank entitled to exercise any right of set-off or combination
                  or consolidation of accounts or having the benefit of any
                  encumbrance over such deposit) and on such terms as the
                  Security Trustee may approve and, if such contingent liability
                  shall fail to mature, shall return such sums (together with
                  any interest earned thereon) to the Security Trustee for
                  distribution in accordance with the terms of this clause
                  24.3); and

         24.3.5   fifthly, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the Charging
                  Companies or other person entitled thereto.

24.4     SECURITY TRUSTEE'S SOLE RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE

         No Charging Company shall have the right to appropriate any payment to,
         or other sum received, recovered or held by, the Security Trustee in or
         towards payment of any particular part of the Secured Obligations and
         the Security Trustee shall have the exclusive right to appropriate any
         such payment or other sum as provided in this clause 24.

24.5     TIMING OF DISTRIBUTION

         Distributions by the Security Trustee shall be made at such times as
         the Security Trustee in its absolute discretion determines to be as
         soon as is reasonably practicable, having regard to all relevant
         circumstances, and the Security Trustee shall have no liability
         whatsoever for any loss or damage which any Beneficiary might sustain
         as a consequence of the timing of any such distribution.

24.6     DATE FOR CALCULATION OF SECURED OBLIGATIONS

         For the purpose of any distribution by the Security Trustee, the
         Security Trustee may, by notice to the Beneficiaries, fix a date (being
         not earlier than the date of such notice) as at which the amount of the
         Secured Obligations are to be calculated.

24.7     CERTIFICATE FROM BENEFICIARY

         For the purposes of determining the amount of any payment to be made to
         any Beneficiary pursuant hereto the Security Trustee shall be entitled
         to call for and rely upon (and it is the intention of the parties that
         the Security Trustee shall rely upon) a certificate from the relevant
         Beneficiary of the amount and nature of any amount due, owing or
         incurred to the relevant Beneficiary at the date fixed by the Security
         Trustee for such purpose and as to such other matters as the Security
         Trustee may deem necessary or desirable to enable it to make a
         distribution.

24.8     MISTAKEN PAYMENTS

         If the Security Trustee makes any distribution contrary to any of the
         provisions of this clause 24 or any distribution made by it otherwise
         transpires to have

                                       40
<PAGE>

         been invalid or the Security Trustee and the person receiving such
         distribution agree that it should be refunded, the recipient shall, to
         the extent that no charge is thereby created, hold the proceeds of that
         distribution on trust to repay to the Security Trustee forthwith on
         demand. If the trust imposed by this clause 24.8 cannot be given effect
         to for whatever reason, including the possible creation thereby of a
         charge, the relevant recipient shall, if and when so requested by the
         Security Trustee, pay an amount equal to the proceeds of that
         distribution required to be held on trust to the Security Trustee.

Debenture (the "SECURITY TRUSTEE") all our rights, title and interest in and to
the Account and the monies from time to time standing to its credit.

We irrevocably and unconditionally instruct and authorise you (notwithstanding

                            FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL DEED

THIS SUPPLEMENTAL DEED is dated                                            20[ ]

BETWEEN:

(1)      [        ] a company registered in England and Wales under number
         [        ] whose registered office is at [           ] (the "NEW
         CHARGING COMPANY");

(2)      THE COMPANIES whose respective names and registered offices are set out
         in the Schedule to this Deed (together the "EXISTING CHARGING
         COMPANIES"); and

(3)      BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION acting through its London branch
         at Bank of America House, 1 Alie Street, London E1 8DE as Security
         Trustee for the Beneficiaries (the "SECURITY TRUSTEE").

WHEREAS:

(A)      By a composite guarantee and debenture dated [        ] (such debenture
         as amended by supplementary deeds being referred to as the
         "DEBENTURE"), the Charging Companies have each covenanted to pay and
         discharge the Secured Obligations and have each guaranteed to the
         Security Trustee the obligations of each of the Obligors.

(B)      As security for their respective obligations under the Debenture, the
         Charging Companies have charged the Collateral to the Security Trustee
         in the manner set out in the Debenture.

(C)      The New Charging Company [became a [wholly-owned] subsidiary of the
         Borrower     on 20[ ]] has been required, pursuant to clause 5.1 of the
         Debenture, to grant a guarantee and debenture to the Security Trustee
         (as Security Trustee for the Beneficiaries) as set out below.

IT IS AGREED as follows:

1        Unless the context otherwise requires, terms used in this Deed and
         defined in the Debenture, but not otherwise defined in this Deed, shall
         have the same meanings as in the Debenture.

2        The New Charging Company covenants separately with the Security Trustee
         (as Security Trustee for the Beneficiaries) and each of the Existing
         Charging Companies that it will be bound by the terms of the Debenture
         in every way as from today's date, as if it had been named as a
         Charging Company in the Debenture.

3        The Existing Charging Companies each covenant separately with the
         Security Trustee and the New Charging Company that they will be bound
         by the terms

                                       63
<PAGE>

         of the Debenture in every way as from today's date, as if the New
         Charging Company had been named as a Charging Company in the Debenture.

The New Charging Company with full title guarantee and as a continuing security
for the discharge in full of the Secured Obligations mortgages, charges and/or,
as appropriate, assigns to the Security Trustee (as Security Trustee for the
Beneficiaries) each of the classes of assets or rights separately referred to in
clauses 2.1 to 2.3 (inclusive) of the Debenture now or hereafter owned or
enjoyed by it, in the same manner and upon the same terms and conditions,
mutatis mutandis, as if such clauses were set out in full in this Deed.

IN WITNESS the parties have caused this Deed to be duly executed on the date
first written above.
