                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SECTION 5.01: EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RIGHTS.

         Nothing contained herein shall require the Company or the Organization
to continue any Participant or Executive in the Company's or Organization's
employ, or require any Participant or Executive to continue in the employ of the
Company or Organization, nor does the Plan create any rights of any Participant,
Executive or Beneficiary or any obligations on the part of the Company or
Organization other than those set forth herein. The benefits payable under this
Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other agreements that may
exist from time to time concerning any other compensation or benefits payable by
the Company or the Organization; provided, however, all amounts paid or payable
to a Participant (or Beneficiary) under the Plan shall be excluded for purposes
of calculating the benefit or other entitlement of any person under any other
employee benefit or compensation plan, program, practice, or policy maintained
by the Company or the Organization.

SECTION 5.02: NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS.

         Except as otherwise provided by law, no benefit, payment or
distribution under this Plan shall be subject either to the claim of any
creditor or a Participant or Beneficiary, or to attachment, garnishment, levy,
execution or other legal or equitable process, by any creditor of such person,
and no such person shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, or
assign (either at law or equity) all or any portion of any benefit, payment or
distribution under this Plan. The Plan shall not in any manner be liable for, or
subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any
person entitled to benefits hereunder.

         In the event that any Participant's or Beneficiary's benefits are
garnished or attached by order of any court, the Company or Organization may
elect to bring an action for a declaratory judgment in a court of competent
jurisdiction to determine the proper recipient of the benefits to be paid by the
Plan. During the pendency of said action, any benefits that become payable may
be paid into the court as they become payable, to be distributed by the court to
the recipient as it deems proper at the close of said action.

SECTION 5.03: WITHHOLDING AND DEDUCTIONS.

         All payments made by the Trustee under the Plan to any Participant or
Beneficiary shall be subject to applicable withholding and to such other
deductions as shall at the time of such payment be required under any income tax
or other law, whether of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, in
the case of payments to a Beneficiary, the delivery to the Trustee of all
necessary waivers, qualifications and other documentation.

         The Company shall withhold, from the Earned Value, all applicable state
and Federal tax under any income tax or other law, whether of the United States
or any other jurisdiction, unless

<PAGE>

the Participant provides to the Company the required form indicating an
exemption from such withholding.

SECTION 5.04: AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

         The Plan may be terminated or amended at any time by MBCI, in its sole
discretion, subject to the following limitations:

         a) In the event of any Plan termination, or in the event of an
amendment which shall adversely affect the right, title or interest of the
Participant (or Beneficiary) with respect to such Earned Value Account, any
unmatured Deferral Period shall be deemed to have reached its Maturity Date on
the date of such termination or amendment, and the Earned Value Account shall
thereupon be paid in accordance with Section 2.04.

         b) Any of the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event
of a Plan termination or amendment as described under item (a) above, where the
Organization provides a replacement of the terminated Plan or adversely affected
portion thereof of equivalent value, the Maturity Date with respect to any then
unmatured Deferral Period shall not be accelerated as provided under said items
but shall occur on its originally scheduled date.

SECTION 5.05: CONSTRUCTION.

         In the construction of the Plan, the masculine shall include the
feminine and the singular the plural in all cases where such meanings would be
appropriate.

SECTION 5.06: CONTROLLING LAW.

         The law of the State of Texas shall be the controlling state law in all
matters relating to the Plan and shall apply to the extent that it is not
preempted by the laws of the United States of America.

SECTION 5.07: EFFECT OF INVALIDITY OF PROVISION.

         If any provision of this Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and
this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been
included.

SECTION 5.08: INUREMENT.

         This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Organization and its successors and assigns and the Participant and any
Beneficiary, or their successors, heirs, executors, administrators and
beneficiaries.
