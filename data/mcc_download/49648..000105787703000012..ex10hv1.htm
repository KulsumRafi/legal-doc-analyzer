<p>IX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Miscellaneous
Provisions<br><br></u></p>

<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Continuation
of Directors in Same Status<br><br></p>

<p>Nothing in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to
the Plan shall be construed as creating or constituting evidence of any
agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain a
Non-Employee Director as a director or in any other capacity for any period of
time or at a particular retainer or other rate of compensation, as conferring
upon any Participant any legal or other right to continue as a director or in
any other capacity, or as limiting, interfering with or otherwise affecting the
right of the Company to terminate a Participant in his capacity as a director
or otherwise at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and without
regard to the effect that such termination might have upon him as a Participant
under the Plan.<br><br></p>

<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Compliance
with Government Regulations<br><br></p>

<p>Neither the Plan nor the Company shall be obligated
to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan at any time unless and
until all applicable requirements imposed by any federal and state securities
and other laws, rules and regulations, by any regulatory agencies or by any stock
exchanges upon which the Common Stock may be listed have been fully met.&nbsp; As a condition precedent to any issuance of
shares of Common Stock and delivery of certificates evidencing such shares
pursuant to the Plan, the Board or the Committee may require a Participant to
take any such action and to make any such covenants, agreements and
representations as the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, in its
discretion deems necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with such
requirements.&nbsp; The Company shall in no
event be obligated to register the shares of Common Stock deliverable under the
Plan pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify or
register such shares under any securities laws of any state upon their issuance
under the Plan or at any time thereafter, or to take any other action in order
to cause the issuance and delivery of such shares under the Plan or any
subsequent offer, sale or other transfer of such shares to comply with any such
law, regulation or requirement.&nbsp;
Participants are responsible for complying with all applicable federal
and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations in connection with
any offer, sale or other transfer of the shares of Common Stock issued under
the Plan or any interest therein including, without limitation, compliance with
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (unless
an exemption therefrom is available), or with the provisions of Rule 144
promulgated thereunder, if applicable, or any successor provisions.&nbsp; Certificates for shares of Common Stock may
be legended as the Committee shall deem appropriate.<br><br></p>

<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nontransferability
of Rights<br><br></p>

<p>No Participant shall have the right to assign the
right to receive any Stock Payment or any other right or interest under the
Plan, contingent or otherwise, or to cause or permit any encumbrance, pledge or
charge of any nature to be imposed on any such Stock Payment (prior to the
issuance of stock certificates evidencing such Stock Payment) or any such right
or interest.<br><br></p>

<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Severability<br><br></p>

<p>In the event that any provision of the Plan is held
invalid, void or unenforceable, the same shall not affect, in any respect
whatsoever, the validity of any other provision of the Plan.<br><br></p>

<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Governing
Law<br><br></p>

<p>To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the
Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Idaho, without regard to the
conflict of law provisions of any state.<br><br></p>
