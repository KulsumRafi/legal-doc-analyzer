                                    ARTICLE 6

                                    METERING

     6.1 Reporting Buyer's Use of Electricity. Not later than 5:00 p.m. on the
first Business Day following the conclusion of any Month during the Term, Tosco
shall in good faith provide Seller and Buyer with Buyer's Load during the
immediately preceding Month, including reasonable supporting data and other
relevant information. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to insure
an accurate determination of Buyer's Load. Tosco's existing meters at existing
Metering Points, or such additional meters as may be necessary to measure
Buyer's consumption of Electricity at additional Metering Points within the
Bayway Property, shall be used for all quantity measurements regarding Buyer's
Load. For purposes of this Agreement, Electricity shall be measured in
kilowatt-hours (kWh), without respect to demand or time of use.

     6.2 Means of Measurement and Notice to Seller. Buyer shall be required to
arrange with Tosco to measure the quantity of Electricity received by Buyer.
Buyer shall arrange with


                                       13
<PAGE>

Tosco to design, install, operate, maintain and own all measuring equipment
necessary for the accurate measurement and determination of Buyer's Load. Such
measurement shall be determined by one or a combination of the following
methods:

          A. Using the registration of any meter or meters of Tosco, if
accurately registering; or

          B. In the absence of an accurately registering meter of Tosco, making
a calibration test or mathematical calculation, if the percentage of error is
ascertainable; or

          C. In the absence of both an accurately registering meter of Tosco and
an ascertainable percentage of error, estimating by reference to quantities
measured during period of similar conditions when Buyer's meter was registering
accurately. Buyer shall arrange with Tosco to repair or recalibrate any
inaccurate meter in a timely manner; or

          D. In the absence of an ability to use any of the above methods of
measurement, estimating by reference to Buyer's operating records for Buyer's
Complex for the period in question.

     6.3 Testing. All meters used for measuring the quantity of Electricity
received by Buyer shall be maintained under the following procedures:

          A. Testing of Meters. Buyer shall arrange with Tosco to test and
verify the accuracy of Tosco's measuring equipment annually in Seller's
presence. The calibration procedure to be used under this Section 6.3A shall be
mutually agreed to by the Parties prior to the time Seller first delivers
Electricity to Buyer. Seller shall have the right to witness and audit any
measuring of, or testing performed on, the meters used to determine Buyer's
Load. Seller shall give timely notice to Buyer and Tosco in advance of taking
any of such actions.

          B. Other Testing of Meters. In the event that a Party notifies the
other Parties that it desires a test of its own or of another Party's
measuring equipment, the Parties shall cooperate to secure a prompt verification
of the accuracy of such equipment.

          C. Costs of Testing. Buyer and Seller shall bear the cost of the
testing and any required adjustments of their respective measuring equipment. In
the event that a Party


                                       14
<PAGE>

requests more frequent testing of another Party's measuring equipment, the
requesting Party shall bear the cost of the testing unless such equipment is
found to be inaccurate by one percent (1%) or greater. For purposes of this
Section 6.3C, the obligations of Buyer shall apply to Tosco's meters used to
measure Buyer's Load.

          D. Corrections of Measuring Equipment. If, upon testing, any measuring
equipment is found to be inaccurate by less than one percent (1%) at a rate
corresponding to the average hourly rate for Electricity supplied by Seller to
Buyer's Complex for the period since the last preceding test, previous
recordings of such equipment shall be considered accurate in computing
deliveries of Electricity hereunder, but such equipment shall be promptly
adjusted to record correctly to the extent possible. If, upon testing, any
measuring equipment shall be found to be inaccurate by greater than one percent
(1%) at a rate corresponding to the average hourly rate for Electricity supplied
by Seller to Buyer's Complex for the period since the last preceding test, then
such equipment shall be promptly adjusted to record properly, to the extent
possible, and any previous recordings by such equipment shall be corrected to
zero error, to the extent possible, and Seller shall promptly send to Buyer,
pursuant to Article 7, billing adjustments based on such corrected recordings.
If no reliable information exists as to when the equipment became inaccurate, it
shall be assumed for correction purposes hereunder that such inaccuracy began at
a point in time midway between the testing date and the last previous date on
which the equipment was tested and found to be accurate or adjusted to be
accurate.

     6.4 Maintenance and Records.

          A. Maintenance. Seller shall have the right to have a representative
present whenever Buyer, Tosco or an Independent Party, as applicable, cleans,
changes, repairs, inspects, tests, calibrates or adjusts any metering equipment
or any equipment used in checking measurements. Seller shall give not less than
five (5) days notice to Buyer or Tosco or the Independent Party, in advance of
taking any such action, unless providing such notice is not feasible as a result
of the need for immediate repairs in which case prompt notice shall be given.

          B. Records. The records from the test of any measurement equipment
owned by Tosco shall remain the property of Tosco, but upon Seller's request to
Buyer and Tosco, Buyer shall arrange to have Tosco submit to Seller Tosco's
records and charts (or, at Tosco's

                                       15
<PAGE>


option, copies thereof), together with calculations therefrom, for inspection
and copying, subject to return by Seller within ten (10) days of receipt
thereof.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                              INVOICES AND PAYMENT

     7.1 Billing. Within ten (10) days of receipt of Buyer's Load for the prior
Month, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, and contemporaneously deliver
a copy to Tosco, an invoice for Buyer's Load in the preceding Month at the price
set forth in Article 5 of this Agreement.

     7.2 Payment. On or before ten (10) days after receipt of Seller's invoice,
or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day,
Buyer shall render by wire transfer the amount set forth on such invoice to the
address provided in Section 14.1, and shall promptly notify Tosco by facsimile
or in such other manner acceptable to Tosco that such payment has been made.
Overdue payments shall accrue interest from and including the due date to, but
excluding, the date of payment at the Interest Rate.


     7.3 Infineum Steam Agreement. Buyer shall not offset any amounts due to
Seller for Electricity under this Agreement by any credits derived pursuant to
the Infineum Steam Agreement.

     7.4 Disputes. If Buyer in good faith disputes an invoice, Buyer shall
provide a written explanation of Buyer's good faith basis for the dispute to
both Seller and Tosco not later than thirty (30) days of the due date for
amounts billed, and Buyer shall pay the entire invoice no later than the due
date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Buyer shall retain the right to
dispute invoices after payment thereof for a period of three (3) years after the
date on which the invoice was paid. If any amount disputed by Buyer is
determined to be due to Buyer, Seller shall pay Buyer within ten (10) days of
such determination, in addition to interest accrued at the Interest Rate from
the date initial payment of the disputed amount was received by Seller until the
date paid to Buyer.

     7.5 Adjustments. Seller shall promptly prepare and deliver to Buyer, and
contemporaneously to Tosco, an invoice setting forth any adjustments for
discrepancies in billing


                                       16
<PAGE>

identified through meter verifications pursuant to Article 6 or for any reason
that would require immediate reimbursement of billed amounts to Buyer or
additional payments by Buyer to Seller hereunder, along with interest accrued at
the Interest Rate from the date such payments or reimbursement should have been
paid in ordinary course to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be.

     7.6 Audit Rights. For a period of three (3) years after the rendering of
any invoice furnished to Buyer pursuant to this Article 7, Buyer and Tosco may
request of Seller and obtain reasonable access to the books, records, files and
other data of the Linden 6 Facility in the possession of Seller to the extent
such are necessary to determine, verify, analyze or confirm the reasonableness
and necessity of the amounts charged and credited pursuant to this Agreement.

     7.7 Books and Records. Buyer and Seller shall each maintain complete and
accurate records concerning the amounts charged and credited pursuant to this
Agreement for a period of three (3) years from the date of invoices therefrom
and shall make such records available to the other Parties in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.6.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                      TAXES

     8.1 Taxes. In the event that Seller seeks to invoice Buyer for New Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall provide written notice to Buyer as soon
as reasonably practicable and shall propose a meeting to negotiate in good faith
a revised price for Electricity. Buyer shall be responsible only for New Taxes
that have been incorporated into a revised price for Electricity. If the Parties
are unable to agree upon a revised price for Electricity, this Agreement shall
terminate thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of such notice from Seller.
Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to administer this Agreement and
implement the provisions in accordance with the intent to minimize Taxes, and
shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and cooperate with the other Parties in
obtaining any exemption from or reduction of any Tax.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                              DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

     9.1 Seller Default. The occurrence of any of the following events shall
constitute a "Default" by Seller (with the understanding by the Parties that a
Default by Seller under this


                                       17
<PAGE>

Agreement shall not constitute a default under the Infineum Steam Agreement
unless the facts constituting a Default hereunder separately constitute a
default thereunder):

          A. Seller fails to pay any amounts due to Buyer hereunder and such
breach continues for a period of fifteen (15) days after notice thereof shall
have been received by Seller from Buyer.

          B. Seller fails to materially perform any obligations to Buyer, or
breaches a material term or condition of this Agreement, including a breach of
its representations and warranties or covenants hereunder, and such breach
continues for a period of sixty (60) days after notice thereof has been received
by Seller from Buyer; provided, that if such breach is not reasonably capable of
being cured within such sixty (60) day period and Seller reasonably commences to
cure such breach within such sixty (60) day period, such sixty (60) day period
shall be extended for such additional period, but in no event longer than
eighteen (18) Months, as is reasonably necessary to remedy such failure if and
for so long as Seller is diligently continuing efforts to pursue a cure for such
breach.

          C. Any sale, assignment or other transfer in violation of Article 13.

     9.2 Buyer Default. The occurrence of any of the following events shall
constitute a "Default" by Buyer (with the understanding by the Parties that a
Default by Buyer under this Agreement shall not constitute a default under the
Infineum Steam Agreement unless the facts constituting a Default hereunder
separately constitute a default thereunder):

          A. Buyer fails to pay any amounts due Seller hereunder and such breach
continues for a period of fifteen (15) days after notice thereof has been
received by Buyer from Seller.

          B. Buyer fails to materially perform any obligation to Seller, or
breaches a material term or condition of this Agreement, including a breach of
its representations and warranties or covenants hereunder other than Sections
9.2A, 9.2C and 9.2D, and such breach continues for a period of sixty (60) days
after notice thereof has been received by Buyer from Seller; provided, that if
such breach is not reasonably capable of being cured within such sixty (60) day
period and provided that Buyer reasonably commences to cure such breach within
such


                                       18
<PAGE>

sixty (60) day period, such sixty (60) day period shall be extended for such
additional period, but in no event longer than eighteen (18) Months, as is
reasonably necessary to remedy such failure if and for so long as Buyer is
diligently continuing efforts to pursue a cure for such breach.

          B. Buyer fails to conduct its operations or activities in a manner so
as to prevent an adverse effect on the qualification of the Linden 6 Facility as
an On-site Generation Facility.

          C. Any sale, assignment or other transfer in violation of Article 13.

     9.3 Tosco's Right to Cure. The Parties agree and acknowledge that upon a
breach by Buyer or Seller, Tosco shall have the same right, but not any
obligation, to prevent a Buyer Default or Seller Default by acting on behalf of
Buyer or Seller within the time required to cure such breach by Buyer or Seller.

     9.4 Remedies. If a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Party that
is not in Default may, at its sole option, elect to terminate this Agreement
and, subject to Article 12, take any action at law or in equity that may be
available to it to enforce the payment of any damages or the performance of all
obligations of the Party in Default hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing
neither Party shall have a right to terminate this Agreement unless such Party
shall have provided the other Parties notice of a breach pursuant to Section
9.1. The breaching Party shall have no less than the specified amount of time to
cure such breach, which time shall expire on the later of the dates available to
the breaching Party.

     9.5 Damages. Upon the occurrence of a Default hereunder, the aggrieved
Party may elect to terminate this Agreement by providing notice thereof to the
defaulting Party and shall be entitled to seek damages as available at law
except as may be limited pursuant to Section 9.5.

     9.6 Limitation on Liability for Damages. The Parties agree that for breach
of any provision under this Agreement, the obligor's liability shall be limited
to direct actual damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are
waived, except that any Party may seek specific performance of any provision of
this Agreement, including such temporary injunctive relief as may be available
at law or in equity. If, for any reason, Seller fails to furnish all or a
portion of Buyer's


                                       19
<PAGE>


Requirements at the Delivery Point and such failure is not excused pursuant to
this Agreement, Buyer's damages shall be limited to the reasonable cost of
replacement power delivered at 230 kV (nominal) to the electrical distribution
facilities of the Bayway Refinery. No Party shall be liable for consequential,
incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other
business interruption damages, by statute, in tort or contract, under any
indemnity provision or otherwise. It is the intent of the Parties that the
limitations herein imposed on remedies and the measure of damages be without
regard to the cause or causes related thereto, including the negligence of any
Party, whether such negligence be sole, joint or concurrent, or active or
passive.

     9.7 Duty to Mitigate. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate the incurrence of damages.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                                  FORCE MAJEURE

     10.1 Force Majeure. If a Claiming Party is rendered wholly or partly unable
to perform its obligations under this Agreement because of a Force Majeure
event, that Party shall be excused from whatever performance is affected by such
Force Majeure event but only to the extent so affected; provided, that: (i) the
Claiming Party, within two (2) days after the occurrence of the Force Majeure
event, gives the other Party notice describing the particulars of the occurrence
and its estimated duration; (ii) the suspension of performance is of no greater
scope and of no longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure event; and
(iii) the Claiming Party uses commercially reasonable efforts to remedy its
inability to perform, to secure substitute suppliers or services and to resume
its full performance under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Claiming
Party's obligation to remedy its inability to perform shall not require the
settlement of any strike, walkout, lockout or other labor dispute on terms that,
in the sole judgment of the Party involved in said dispute, are contrary to its
best interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be excused by reason of Force Majeure from
its obligation to pay any amounts due under this Agreement.

     10.2 Force Majeure Defined. "Force Majeure" means any event beyond the
reasonable control of the Party affected thereby that adversely affects the
ability of such Party to perform




                                       20
<PAGE>

any obligation hereunder (other than failure to pay money when due), including
but not limited to the following: acts of God, war or foreign enemy; unusually
severe weather conditions; flood; earthquake; storm; hurricane; epidemics;
lightning; fire; drought; explosion; riot; civil disturbance; strikes, lockouts
or similar labor interruptions or labor disputes; sabotage; an event of force
majeure occurring with respect to, or a suspension, curtailment or service
interruption of, any third party supplier of Electricity, gas, water or waste
water, or any Third Party Electricity, gas, water or waste water transmission or
distribution provider (including any independent system operator or equivalent,
and any interstate natural gas pipeline or any local Electricity, gas or water
distribution company or provider of waste water); arrests and restraints of
rules and people; any action of a court or a binding order of any Governmental
Authority; inability after diligent application to obtain or maintain required
permits, zoning or other required approvals from any Governmental Authority or
other Third Party whose consent is required as a condition to a Party's
performance hereunder; failure of Third Party facilities or Third Party major
equipment breakdown; failure of any contractor, subcontractor or supplier to
furnish labor, services, materials or equipment on the dates agreed to if such
failure is caused by a Force Majeure; a change in applicable law; the failure of
any public agency or Governmental Authority or any utility having jurisdiction
of the Existing Plant to maintain utilities, services, water and sewer lines and
power transmission lines; and any circumstance that would in the reasonable
opinion of such Party endanger persons or property. A failure of equipment or
machinery controlled or operated by a Party (whether leased or owned) shall not
be considered Force Majeure irrespective of whether such equipment or machinery
has been designed, manufactured, installed, or maintained by the Party or a
Third Party unless such failure was due to a Force Majeure.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                 INDEMNIFICATiON

     11.1 Indemnification for Claims. Each Party shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the other Parties and their officers, directors, employees,
contractors, subcontractors, Affiliates and agents ("Related Parties") from and
against any and all Third Party liabilities, claims, injuries (including death
resulting therefrom), property damage, fines, penalties or assessments by any
public agency, insofar as not prohibited by law, costs or expenses (including


                                       21
<PAGE>

costs of defense, settlement and reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively,
"Claims") to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the
indemnifying Party or its Related Parties in connection with performance under
this Agreement. The term "liabilities" in the preceding sentence, and the
indemnification obligation, include any strict liability and other liability
without fault, however named, asserted against the Parties indemnified.

     11.2 Notice. Each Party hereto shall promptly furnish the other Parties
with notification (but in no event later than ten (10) days prior to the time
any response is required by law) after such Party becomes aware of any event or
circumstance which might give rise to such indemnification.

     11.3 Defense. The indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend any
suit asserting a Claim covered by this indemnity and shall pay all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) that may be
incurred in enforcing this indemnity. The indemnified Party may, at its own
expense, retain separate counsel and participate in the defense of any such suit
or action. The indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle a Claim
hereunder without the prior written consent of the indemnified Party; provided,
however, that in the event such consent shall be withheld, then the liability of
the indemnifying Party shall be limited to the aggregate of the amount of the
proposed compromise or settlement, the amount of counsel fees and expenses
outstanding at the time such consent shall have been withheld, and the amount of
any outstanding claim against which indemnification applies and which is not
covered by the proposed compromise or settlement (together with all costs and
expenses associated with such outstanding Claim). Thereafter, the Party
withholding such consent shall hold harmless and reimburse the indemnifying
Party, upon demand, for the amount of any additional liability, counsel fees and
expenses incurred by the indemnifying Party over and above the amounts described
above after the time such consent shall have been withheld. To the extent a
Party disputes its obligation to indemnify another Party or Parties, it shall
not be considered a breach of this Agreement for such Party to fail to perform
under this Section 11.3 until such time as such Party is determined to have the
obligation to indemnify under Section 11.1.

     11.4 Survival of Indemnifications. The provisions of this Article shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

          The Parties agree to define "Confidential Information" as all
information, data and other non-public information and materials (including
information concerning Buyer's or Seller's or Tosco's operations such as
information regarding maintenance at Buyer's Complex or the Bayway Refinery, the
Existing Plant or the Linden 6 Facility) relating to this Agreement and the


                                       26
<PAGE>

terms or conditions of this Agreement or disclosed pursuant to any term or
provision of this Agreement that is provided by a Party to one or more of the
Parties in written, graphical or other tangible form marked "Confidential" or
with similar legend clearly identifying the Party's proprietary interest, or in
oral form with the proviso that, if orally transmitted, such information shall
be identified as confidential and the confidential nature of such information
shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the initial oral
disclosure. The Parties agree that all Confidential Information shall be kept
confidential and shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose other than
matters related to this Agreement; provided, however, that Confidential
Information may be disclosed to any Party on a need to know basis in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Such obligations of confidentiality shall
survive the termination of this Agreement by three (3) years. Each Party shall
be permitted to disclose Confidential Information to such Party's and its
Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants,
consultants, contractors or advisors who need to know such information for the
purpose of implementing this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and agrees to notify such Persons of the confidential nature of such
Confidential Information, and to be responsible for any unauthorized disclosure
of such Confidential Information by such Persons. Seller shall be permitted to
disclose Confidential Information to those of its Lenders and prospective
Lenders or prospective purchasers who agree to keep such information
confidential by executing a confidentiality agreement in form and substance
which reasonably satisfies the provisions of this Article. Confidential
Information shall not be deemed confidential if it (i) was in the public domain
prior to the date hereof, (ii) becomes publicly available after the date hereof
other than as a result of the unauthorized disclosure thereof by a Party or by
an officer, director, employee, agent or Affiliate of a Party, or (iii) is
required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable laws or regulations or pursuant
to administrative or judicial process; provided, however, that the disclosing
Party provides the non-disclosing Parties with written notice of the
Confidential Information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as
is practicable and that, except with regard to disclosures to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the disclosing Party uses its best efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. The
Parties shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity to
enforce or seek relief in connection with this confidentiality obligation.

                              PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

          The price that Buyer shall pay to Seller for all Electricity furnished
to Buyer shall be determined as follows:

          A. From and after Commercial Operation based on the HTS Price
effective February 7, 2001, and until a new HTS Rate Schedule becomes effective,
the price for all Electricity (in cents per kWh) shall be:


               5.76 cents per kWh,

               plus, when the Linden 6 Facility is operating and the Cost of
          Fuel exceeds $6.00 per MMBtu, 0.315 multiplied by the difference
          between the Cost of Fuel* less $6.00 per MMBtu. [Price for Electricity
          = 5.76 + 0.315 x (Cost of Fuel - 6.00) for Cost of Fuel > $6.00 per
          MMBtu]

          B. From and after the Day upon which a new HTS Rate Schedule becomes
effective, the price for Electricity (in cents per kWh) shall be the calculated
as follows; of:

               (1) If the Cost of Fuel is less than or equal to $7.00 per MMBtu,
then the price for Electricity shall be the HTS Price multiplied by 0.9 [Price
for Electricity = HTS Price Calculated in Exhibit B x 0.9];

               (2) If the Cost of Fuel is greater than $7.00 per MMBtu, then the
price for Electricity shall be the greater of:

               (a) HTS Price multiplied by 0.9 [calculation same as (1) above],
          or

               (b) the sum of HTS Price multiplied by 0.45

               plus 0.6 cents,

               plus 0.4053 multiplied by the Cost of Fuel [Price for Electricity
          = (HTS Price Calculated in Exhibit B x 0.45) + 0.6 + (0.4053 x Cost of
          Fuel)]


<PAGE>


               (3) If, for any Month, the Linden 6 Facility is not operated to
produce Electricity supplied to Infineum for the entire Month, then the price
for Electricity for such Month shall be the HTS Price multiplied by 0.9 for all
fuel prices [Price for Electricity + HTS Price Calculated in Exhibit B x 0.9];

provided, however, if at any time during this Agreement, the new HTS Price is
more than ten percent (10%) lower than the new HTS Price effective on
February 7, 2001, the Parties shall meet and negotiate the price for
Electricity.

Monthly kWh           kWh supplied by Tosco/Infineum meter readings
Peak kW               Monthly kWh / (0.9389 x HRS)                        0.9389 assumed constant

KILOWATT CHARGE:      Peak kW x A or B        A (June through September)    B (October through May)

KILOWATT-HOUR CHARGE:

                      kWh x C x 0.41667/100   peak usage 14 hours per day, 5 days per week - 14 x 5/(24 x 7) = 0.041667
                      plus
                      kWh x D x 0.08333/100   intermediate usage 14 hours on Saturday, 12/(24 x 7) = 0.08333
                      plus
                      kWh x E x 0.50/100       off peak - rest of the time 1.0 - 0.41667 - 0.08333 = 0.50

(if kilowatt-hour charge were split between winter/summer in the future, consistent method would be used with split)

SERVICE CHARGE: F          Monthly fee from rate schedule

TOTAL MONTHLY BILL:        Kilowatt charge + kilowatt-hour charge + service charge

HTS PRICE = AVERAGE POWER COST = TOTAL MONTHLY BILL / MONTHLY kWh * 100 (IN CENTS/kWh)

are calculated on the basis of the assigned Capacity and Transmission Obligation
as determined below. The Distribution Charge Remainder per kilowatt will vary
monthly such that each customer's bill for the sum of the above individual
kilowatt charges (charge times demand or obligation as applicable), including
the Distribution Charge Remainder, equals the Total Charge times times the
applicable maximum demand.
