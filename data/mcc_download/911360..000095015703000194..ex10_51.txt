     incurred or suffered, directly or indirectly, by (i) any of CAB, Settlor,
     subsidiaries of Settlor (excluding Cervecerias Baru-Panama, S.A. and its
     subsidiaries) or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
     agents or representatives and that arise in connection with any breach of,
     or inaccuracy in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants made
     by Settlor, or made or confirmed by the Accepting Shareholders, in the
     Share Subscription Agreement or Tender Offer Documents (a "GENERAL LOSS")
     or (ii) Settlor and its subsidiaries Ventas y Mercadeo, S.A. and Direccion
     y Administracion de Empresas, S.A. resulting from the lawsuit filed by
     Refrescos Nacionales, S.A. against the Settlor and its subsidiaries Ventas
     y Mercadeo, S.A. and Direccion y Administracion de Empresas, S.A. for
     alleged antitrust practices, to the extent such lawsuit is settled or is
     the subject of a final, non-appealable judgment (the "LAWSUIT LOSS"). For
     purposes hereof, any General Loss or Lawsuit Loss shall be referred to
     herein as a "LOSS" and together as "LOSSES".

     8.1  Claim for General Loss

     (a)  If at any time prior to the Final Termination Date (as defined below),
          CAB determines that any of CAB, Settlor, subsidiaries of Settlor
          (excluding



                                       4

<PAGE>


          Cervecerias Baru-Panama, S.A. and its subsidiaries) or any of their
          respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives
          has suffered a General Loss, or is reasonably likely to suffer a
          General Loss, CAB shall deliver to Representative a notice summarizing
          in reasonable detail the nature and amount of the General Loss. If the
          amount of a General Loss is not yet certain on the date of such
          notice, CAB shall provide a good faith estimate of the maximum General
          Loss likely to be incurred. The Loss specified or estimated in such
          notice shall be referred to herein as the "Owed Amount".

     (b)  Concurrently with the delivery of any notice by CAB to the
          Representative of a Loss pursuant to Section 8.1(a) above, CAB will
          deliver to the Trustee a certificate in substantially the form of
          Exhibit B attached hereto (a "CERTIFICATE OF INSTRUCTION"). The
          Trustee shall give written notice to the Representative of its receipt
          of a Certificate of Instruction not later than two business days
          following receipt thereof, together with a copy of such Certificate of
          Instruction.

     (c)  If Representative objects to any claim of CAB reflected in a
          Certificate of Instruction, Representative shall notify CAB, and CAB
          and Representative shall promptly review the claim together and
          attempt to address Representative's objections. If, within 15 days
          following CAB's delivery of the Certificate of Instruction to the
          Trustee (the "CONCILIATION PERIOD"), CAB and Representative agree that
          CAB's claim as reflected in the Certificate of Instruction should be
          modified, CAB and Representative shall execute jointly and deliver to
          the Trustee a Resolution Certificate in substantially the form
          attached as Exhibit C.

     (d)  If, within the Conciliation Period, the Trustee receives a Resolution
          Certificate signed by both CAB and Representative, it shall promptly
          pay over to CAB from the Trust Assets, by wire transfer of immediately
          available funds to a bank account of CAB's designation, the Owed
          Amount set forth in the Resolution Certificate. If Trustee does not
          receive a Resolution Certificate signed by both CAB and Representative
          before expiration of the Conciliation Period, the Trustee shall,
          notwithstanding any objection by Representative or any other party,
          promptly upon expiration of the Conciliation Period pay over to CAB
          from the Trust Assets, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
          to a bank account of CAB's designation, the Owed Amount set forth in
          the Certificate of Instruction from the Trust Assets. Such obligation
          of the Trustee shall be absolute and unconditional.

     (e)  If the Representative should dispute or object to the Loss claimed by
          CAB in the notice to Representative given pursuant to Section 8.1(a)
          or in the Certificate of Instruction, and CAB has not agreed during
          the Conciliation Period to modify its claim by executing a Resolution
          Certificate, Representative shall have no right to object to or
          prevent the disbursement of funds to CAB by the Trustee pursuant to
          Section 8.1(d). The Representative's sole recourse shall be to
          commence an arbitration action against CAB pursuant to Section 29
          hereof to reclaim the amounts paid over to CAB by Trustee pursuant to
          the Certificate of Instruction. If, following any disbursement from
          the Trust Assets to CAB


                                       5

<PAGE>


          pursuant to this Section 8.1, the actual amount of an estimated Loss
          is finally determined by CAB to be less than the Owed Amount specified
          with respect to such Loss and paid to CAB, CAB shall within ten (10)
          business days remit to Representative the amount by which the Owed
          Amount exceeded such actual Loss plus interest at a rate equal to the
          annual rate of return of the Trust Assets for the period of time
          during which CAB held the excess funds or, for any period of time
          after the Trust Assets have been fully disbursed, a rate of five
          percent (5%) per annum.

     8.2  Claims for Lawsuit Loss

     (a)  If at any time prior to the Final Termination Date, the Settlor,
          Ventas y Mercadeo, S.A. or Direccion y Administracion de Empresas,
          S.A. has suffered any Lawsuit Loss, CAB shall deliver to
          Representative a copy of the judgment (including any form of
          settlement permitted under Panamanian law) issued by the corresponding
          court of justice, with the amount of the Lawsuit Loss. The Lawsuit
          Loss (including any interest thereon from the date incurred until the
          date of payment and reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses)
          specified or estimated in such notice shall be referred to herein as
          the "Lawsuit Owed Amount".

     (b)  Concurrently with the delivery of any notice by CAB to the
          Representative of a Lawsuit Loss pursuant to Section 8.2(a) above, CAB
          will deliver to the Trustee a Certificate of Instruction. The Trustee
          shall give written notice to the Representative of its receipt of a
          Certificate of Instruction not later than two business days following
          receipt thereof, together with a copy of such Certificate of
          Instruction.

     (c)  Upon receipt of the Certificate of Instruction the Trustee shall
          promptly pay over to CAB from the Trust Assets, by wire transfer of
          immediately available funds to a bank account of CAB's designation,
          the Lawsuit Owed Amount set forth in the Certificate of Instruction.

     (d)  Representative shall have no right to object to or prevent the
          disbursement of funds to CAB by the Trustee pursuant to this Section
          8.2. The Representative's sole recourse shall be to commence an
          arbitration action against CAB pursuant to Section 29 hereof to
          reclaim the amounts paid over to CAB by Trustee pursuant to this
          Section 8.2.

     8.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8 to the contrary, (i) the
          Trustee shall not be required to make any payments to CAB for any Loss
          if all amounts in the Trust Assets have been released or otherwise
          previously distributed and (ii) CAB shall have no right to claim a
          Loss hereunder prior to the earlier of (A) the date of the closing of
          the OPA and (B) December 31, 2002.

9.   Release of Trust Assets.

     (a)  Promptly after the expiration of the relevant acceptance period of the
          OPA as set forth in the Tender Offer Documents (the "ACCEPTANCE
          TERMINATION DATE"), the


                                       6


<PAGE>


          Trustee shall notify CAB of the amount of the Trust Assets not to be
          retained on behalf of the Accepting Shareholders. During the thirty
          (30) day period after CAB's receipt of such notice, CAB shall have the
          right to exchange such number of its Shares as CAB shall determine for
          all or a portion of the remaining Trust Amount, based on a per share
          price of the greater of $22.55 or the Adjusted Coca Cola OPA Purchase
          Price (as defined in the Share Subscription Agreement). In order to
          exercise the exchange rights granted hereby, CAB shall deliver notice
          to the Trustee together with a certificate representing the Shares and
          an assignment or endorsement thereof with respect to the number of
          Shares to be exchanged. Promptly thereafter, Trustee shall pay to CAB
          an amount equal to the number of exchanged Shares times the greater of
          $22.55 or the Adjusted Coca Cola OPA Purchase Price (as defined in the
          Share Subscription Agreement).

     (b)  Fifty-three and one-third percent (53.33%) of the Trust Assets will be
          held by the Trustee for the recovery of Losses until the date which is
          twenty-four (24) months after the earlier of (A) the date of the
          closing of the OPA and (B) December 31, 2002 and (ii) forty-six and
          two-thirds percent (46.67%) of the Trust Assets will be held by the
          Trustee for the recovery of Losses until the date on which the lawsuit
          filed by Refrescos Nacionales, S.A. against the Settlor and its
          subsidiaries Ventas y Mercadeo, S.A. and Direccion y Administracion de
          Empresas, S.A. for alleged antitrust practices is settled or is the
          subject of a final, non-appealable judgment (the earlier of the dates
          described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be referred to herein as the
          "INITIAL TERMINATION DATE" and the later of such dates, the "FINAL
          TERMINATION DATE"); provided, however, that such lawsuit shall not be
          settled without the consent of the Representative, such consent not to
          be unreasonably withheld, and any dispute relating to the granting or
          withholding of such consent shall be governed by Section 29 hereof;
          provided further, if any claims for Losses are pending as of the
          Initial Termination Date or the Final Termination Date, as the case
          may be, then such date shall be extended to such time as all such
          claims have been fully satisfied or otherwise disposed.

10.  Termination.

     (a)  Subject to Section 10(b), this Trust Agreement, and all obligations of
          the Trustee hereunder shall terminate on the earliest of: (i) the
          Final Termination Date, (ii) such earlier date on which all of the
          Trust Assets shall have been disbursed in accordance with the terms of
          this Trust Agreement, or (iii) the date on which CAB and
          Representative jointly notify the Trustee in writing of their intent
          to terminate the Trust Agreement, subject to the Trustee's consent
          (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). In connection with
          termination of this Trust Agreement in accordance with this Section
          10(a), upon payment of all Fees due to the Trustee, the Trust Assets
          then held hereunder shall be distributed pro rata for the benefit of
          the Accepting Shareholders, based upon the amount of shares tendered
          by each such Accepting Shareholder in the acceptance of the OPA. For
          that purpose, Banco General, S.A. or another qualified financial
          institution appointed by Settlor to serve as the paying agent of the
          OPA (the "PAYING AGENT") shall certify (the "PAYING AGENT
          CERTIFICATION") to the Trustee the

                                      7

          occur during the Unconditional Period (as defined in the Share
          Subscription Agreement)) or CAB and Representative jointly (if such
          exercise shall not occur during the Unconditional Period) shall send
          notice of such exercise to the Trustee in the form attached as Exhibit
          D-1 or Exhibit D-2 hereto, as the case may be, (b) together with the
          delivery of such notice as described in clause (a) above, CAB shall
          deliver to the Trustee a copy of the certificate delivered pursuant to
          Section 10 of the Trust Agreement- Coca Cola OPA Trust, dated as of
          the date hereof among the parties hereto, (c) the Trustee shall
          deliver to CAB all of the Trust Assets (net of Fees due to the
          Trustee) by wire transfer in immediately available funds, and (d) this
          Trust Agreement and all obligations of the Trustee hereunder shall
          terminate.

11.  Duties and Obligations of the Trustee. The duties and obligations of the
     Trustee shall be limited to and determined solely by the provisions of this
     Trust Agreement and the certificates delivered in accordance herewith, and
     the Trustee is not charged with knowledge of or any duties or
     responsibilities in respect of any other agreement or document. In
     furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:

     (a)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss of interest or earnings
          sustained as a result of investments made hereunder in accordance with
          the terms hereof, including any liquidation of any investment of the
          Trust Assets prior to its maturity effected in order to make a payment
          required by the terms of this Trust Agreement;

     (b)  The Trustee shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon any
          written certification, instruction, notice, direction, request,
          waiver, consent, receipt or other document that the Trustee reasonably
          believes to be genuine and duly authorized, executed and delivered;

     (c)  The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any
          act done or omitted by it, or for any mistake in fact or law, or for
          anything that it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith;
          provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision in this
          Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall be liable for its willful
          misconduct or gross negligence;

     (d)  The Trustee may seek the advice of legal counsel selected with
          reasonable care (provided that the selection of such legal counsel
          shall require CAB's prior written consent, such consent not to be
          unreasonably withheld) in the event of any dispute or question as to
          the construction of any of the provisions of this Trust

          Agreement or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and
          shall be fully protected in respect of any action taken, omitted or
          suffered by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such
          counsel;

     (e)  In the event that the Trustee shall in any instance, after seeking the
          advice of legal counsel pursuant to the immediately preceding clause,
          in good faith be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder, it
          shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action in that instance
          and its sole obligation, in addition to those of its duties hereunder
          as to which there is no such uncertainty, shall be to keep the
          property affected by such uncertainty safely held in trust until it
          shall be directed otherwise in writing by CAB and the Representative;
          provided, however, in the event that the Trustee has not received such
          written direction within thirty (30) days after requesting the same,
          it shall have the right to submit the issue to arbitration in
          accordance with Section 29 hereof; and

     (f)  The Trustee may execute any of its powers or responsibilities
          hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder either directly or by or
          through agents or attorneys selected with reasonable care. Nothing in
          this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose upon the Trustee any
          duty to qualify to do business or to act as fiduciary or otherwise in
          any jurisdiction other than the Republic of Panama and the Trustee
          shall not be responsible for and shall not be under a duty to examine
          into or pass upon the validity, binding effect, execution or
          sufficiency of this Trust Agreement or of any agreement amendatory or
          supplemental hereto.

     (g)  The Trustee shall issue, or shall cause a financial institution
          (including Banco General, S.A.) to issue, a letter or a bank guarantee
          confirming the availability of sufficient funds to settle the
          obligations derived from the OPA, as required by applicable securities
          legislation of the Republic of Panama.

12.  Cooperation. Settlor, CAB and Representative shall provide to the Trustee
     all instruments and documents within their respective powers to provide
     that are necessary for the Trustee to perform its duties and
     responsibilities hereunder.

13.  Fees and Expenses; Indemnity.

     (a)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, the
          Trustee is authorized to deduct from earnings on the Trust Amount an
          acceptance fee of $10,000, and an annual fee of $15,000, both payable
          upon execution of this Trust Agreement. The annual fee will be payable
          thereafter on each anniversary of the execution of this Trust
          Agreement. The Trustee will charge a fee of $4 per check for payments
          to the Beneficiaries (as set forth in Section 3 hereof) and Settlor
          upon liquidation of the Trust. The Trustee also shall be entitled to
          receive reasonable and customary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
          connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. The fees,
          costs and expenses described in this Section 13(a) shall be referred
          to herein as "FEES".


                                       9


<PAGE>

     (b)  The Trustee is authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the
          earnings on the Trust Amount, from time to time, the amount of any
          Fees due and payable to it hereunder. If for any reason such earnings
          are insufficient to cover such Fees, CAB shall pay within the
          following thirty (30) days such amounts to make up such shortfall to
          Trustee upon the presentation of an itemized invoice. The Trustee
          shall notify CAB and Representative of any disbursement from the Trust
          Assets to itself in respect of any Fees under any provision of this
          Trust Agreement and shall furnish to CAB and Representative copies of
          all related invoices and other statements.

     (c)  Prior to the consummation or termination of the OPA, CAB shall be
          liable for and shall reimburse and indemnify Trustee (and any
          predecessor Trustee) and hold Trustee harmless from and against
          one-half (1/2) of any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities,
          costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
          expenses) arising from or in connection with Trustee's administration
          of, or performance of duties and obligations pursuant to, this Trust
          Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, CAB
          shall not be required to indemnify the Trustee for any such claims,
          losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses caused by its
          own gross negligence or own willful misconduct. In addition, when the
          Trustee acts on any information, instructions or communications
          (including, but not limited to, communications with respect to the
          delivery of securities or the wire transfer of funds) sent by
          telephone, telex or facsimile, the Trustee, absent gross negligence or
          willful misconduct, shall not be responsible or liable in the event
          such communication is not an authorized or authentic communication or
          is not in the form CAB sent or intended to send (whether due to fraud,
          distortion or otherwise). The Trustee shall have the right to offset
          an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of any indemnifiable claims, losses,
          actions, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses described above
          against the Trust Assets.

     (d)  Settlor shall be liable for one hundred percent (100%) of all
          indemnifiable claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or
          expenses described in Section 13(c) above after consummation of the
          OPA (including payment of the Certified Amount to the Paying Agent) or
          termination of the OPA, and the Trustee will have no right to offset
          any amount thereof against the Trust Assets.

     (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, all of
          CAB's compensation, reimbursement and indemnification obligations set
          forth in this Section 13 shall be payable by CAB upon demand by the
          Trustee, and the failure of CAB to fund such obligations shall give
          rise to the right of the Trustee to offset any such unpaid amounts
          against payments otherwise due to CAB pursuant to this Trust
          Agreement. The obligations of CAB under this Section 13 shall survive
          any termination of this Trust Agreement and the resignation or removal
          of Trustee.

14.  Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

     (a)  The Trustee may resign as such thirty (30) calendar days following the
          giving of written notice thereof to CAB and Representative. In
          addition, the Trustee may be removed and replaced on a date designated
          in a written instrument signed by CAB and Representative and delivered
          to the Trustee. In the case of either such resignation or removal, CAB
          and the Representative jointly shall appoint a branch or affiliate
          located in the Republic of Panama of one of HSBC, BNP Paribas or
          Citibank, N.A. as the successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, no such resignation or removal shall be effective until a
          successor Trustee has acknowledged its appointment as such as provided
          in Section 14(c). In either event, upon the effective date of
          such resignation or removal, the Trustee shall deliver the
          property comprising the Trust Assets (net of any Fees due to the
          Trustee) to such successor Trustee, together with such records
          maintained by the Trustee in connection with its duties hereunder and
          other information with respect to the Trust Assets as such successor
          may reasonably request.

     (b)  If a successor Trustee shall not have acknowledged its appointment as
          such as provided in Section 14(c), in the case of a resignation, prior
          to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days following the date of a
          notice of resignation or, in the case of a removal, on the date
          designated for the Trustee's removal, as the case may be, because CAB
          and Representative are unable to agree on a successor Trustee, or for
          any other reason, the successor Trustee shall be appointed from the
          first of HSBC, BNP Paribas and Citibank, N.A. (in such order) to
          acknowledge its appointment as such, and such appointment shall be
          binding upon all of the parties to this Trust Agreement.

     (c)  Upon written acknowledgment by a successor Trustee appointed in
          accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 of its
          agreement to serve as Trustee hereunder and the receipt of the
          property then comprising the Trust Assets, the Trustee shall be fully
          released and relieved of all duties, responsibilities and obligations
          under this Trust Agreement, subject to the provision contained in
          Section 11(c) and such successor Trustee shall for all purposes hereof
          be the Trustee.
