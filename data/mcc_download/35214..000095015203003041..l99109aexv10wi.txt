                                   SCHEDULE II

         Ferro Corporation has entered into an executive employment agreement
with Hector R. Ortino which is substantially identical in all material respects
to the Form of Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (Exhibit
10(a) to Ferro Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31,
1998), except the lump sum severance payment for Mr. Ortino is equal to a full
year's compensation (base salary and incentive compensation) multiplied by
three.

         Beginning in 1999, the Company discontinued its practice of signing
executive employment agreements. The Company has entered into change in control
agreements substantially identical with its form of change in control agreement
(Exhibit 10(j) to Ferro Corporation's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2000) with the following executive officers:

                                  James C. Bays
                                 Dale G. Kramer
                               Millicent W. Pitts
                                Robert A. Rieger
