Attention: Mr. Lance Dermeik                     Proposal # Hansens-1-16-03-PBR2
1001 Pomona Rd.
Corona, Ca. 91720
Re; Hansens Project, Corona, California


Following is the proposal we have been  discussing  for the  additional  storage
requirement. We are partnering with Hannibal Industries structural steel racking
and Advanced  Storage  Solutions 5 deep cart system and are pleased to offer the
following storage proposal for your approval.

System Parameters

The  system  following  takes  into  consideration  Hansen's  requirement  for a
"flexible" system that can be reconfigured as Hansens product mix changes.

We have consulted with Mr. Jerry Hefner, the fire consultant of record. Hansen's
commodities are able to be stored up to 27' with the in place  EFSR-25-M  system
or within 36" of the  sprinkler  heads.  The first two pallets will be stored on
the floor ( as is the current layout) and having three levels of carts above for
a total of 5 levels.  Hansen's can change the  elevations to suit there needs in
the  future as the  structure  and carts are  designed  based on an average of a
2300# load.

The system is based on 42" wide x 48" deep  pallets,  up to 2,300#  average  per
pallet.

System layout is based on using four rows of 5 deep of push back rack system.

Four rows of 5 deep x 5 high 18-1/2 bays wide, 37 lanes (3@ 5-1/2 bays each plus
2 additional bays) resulting in 3,700 pallet positions.

INSTALLATION
Installation will be staged.  First section will be installed  approximately mid
January.  Installation is based on doing 1 section at a time. One section can be
completed in five 9 hour days.
