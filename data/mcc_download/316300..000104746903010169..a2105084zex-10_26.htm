SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convertible Collateral</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. EXCO may present for conversion any Collateral which is convertible into any other instrument or

SIZE=2><B>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceleration</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Obligation shall, at EXCO's option, become immediately due and payable, and the obligation, if any, of
EXCO to permit further borrowings under the Obligation shall at EXCO's option immediately cease and terminate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidation of Collateral</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Upon 20&nbsp;days written to notice to Pledgor (and if such event of default has not been
cured), sell, or instruct any Agent or Broker to sell, all or any part of the Collateral in a public or private sale, direct any Agent or Broker to liquidate all or any part of the Collateral and
deliver all proceeds thereof to EXCO, and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the Obligation in such order and manner as EXCO shall, in its discretion, choose. </FONT></P>

cured), all of the rights, powers and remedies of a secured creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") as adopted in the jurisdiction to which EXCO is subject under this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation of Shares.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> EXCO may cancel the Collateral on its stock transfer books at a value equal to the closing price
on the Nasdaq Stock Market or other securities market on which shares of EXCO's Common Stock is then traded on the date of cancellation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Pledgor
specifically understands and agrees that any sale by EXCO of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Agreement may be effected by EXCO at times and in manners which could
result in the proceeds of such sale as being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at different times or in different manners, and Pledgor hereby
releases EXCO and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If,
in the opinion of EXCO, there is any question that a public sale or distribution of any Collateral will violate any state or federal securities law, EXCO may offer and sell such Collateral in a
transaction exempt from registration under federal securities law, and any such sale made in good faith by EXCO shall be deemed "commercially reasonable." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties Bound.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> EXCO's rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns, and in the event of any
assignment or transfer of any of the Obligation or the Collateral, EXCO thereafter shall be fully discharged from any responsibility with respect to the Collateral so assigned or transferred, but EXCO
shall retain all rights and powers hereby given with respect to any of the Obligation or the Collateral not so assigned or transferred. All representations, warranties and agreements of Pledgor if
more than one are joint and several and all shall be binding upon the personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of Pledgor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> No delay of EXCO in exercising any power or right shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any power or right preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No waiver by EXCO of any right hereunder or of any default
by Pledgor shall be binding upon EXCO unless in writing, and no failure by EXCO to exercise any power or right hereunder or waiver of any default by Pledgor shall operate as a waiver of any other or
further exercise of such right or power or of any further default. Each right, power and remedy of EXCO as provided for herein or in any of the loan documents related to the Obligation, or which shall
now or hereafter exist at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning
of the exercise by EXCO of any one or more of such rights, powers or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by EXCO of any or all other such rights, powers or remedies. </FONT></P>
