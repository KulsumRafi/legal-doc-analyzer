or omitted to be taken by the Executive in the Executive's good faith belief
that such action or failure to act was in the best interest of United (provided

remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity or any parent thereof) less than 80% of the combined voting
power of the securities of United or such surviving entity or any parent
thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or
under clause (ii) above, by reason of the receipt of securities pursuant
to a plan of reorganization of United which constitutes at least 25% or
more of the total combined voting power of United's then outstanding securities,
which were received on account of any claims acquired after the date hereof
and held as of the consummation of the plan of reorganization by any person,
entity or group of associated persons or entities acting in concert, acquiring
such claims with the intent to control the management and policies of United
on an ongoing basis following reorganization, or under clause (iii) above,
by reason of the sale of assets to another commercial airline, unless such
sale results in either (x) creditors or interestholders of United receiving
in consideration or exchange for their claims and/or interests in United
at least 80% of the combined voting power of the acquirer, or (y) United&nbsp;
receiving at least 80% of the combined voting power of the acquirer."</ol>
