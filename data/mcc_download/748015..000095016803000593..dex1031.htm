and applicable state and local income taxes imposed on the compensation income attributable to the Repurchase and on the gross-up bonus itself, (b) assuming the maximum combined marginal individual tax rates, (c) disregarding any other tax
attributes of the Executive (other than the deductibility of state and local income taxes for federal income tax purposes) and (d) assuming the Executive&#146;s basis in the Shares was fair market value (as used by the parties in determining the
1998 tax consequences of the option exercise) as of the date the Shares were acquired by the Executive. In addition, the Company shall also include in the gross-up bonus the amount of any payroll taxes and underpayment of estimated tax penalties
imposed on the Executive as a result of the additional compensation income he is treated as receiving as a result of the Repurchase and the receipt of the gross-up bonus. The Company shall pay the gross-up bonus to the Executive promptly after any
such determination to treat the Repurchase as a compensatory event is made. The foregoing protections to the Executive shall apply equally to any future repurchase of shares by the Company occasioned by the exercise of any Put Right by the Executive
