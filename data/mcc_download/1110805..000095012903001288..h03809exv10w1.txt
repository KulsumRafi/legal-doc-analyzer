                                    ARTICLE I
                                   Definitions

at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Adjusted LIBO Rate" means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing
for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if
necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest
Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.

         "Administrative Agent" means JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The
Chase Manhattan Bank, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders
hereunder.

         "Administrative Questionnaire" means an Administrative Questionnaire in

         "Affiliate" means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person
that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is
Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.

         "Agreement" means this Credit Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2000,
as amended and restated through March 6, 2003 among the Borrower, the Lenders,
the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, and the Co-Documentation
Agents, as the same may be amended, waived or otherwise modified from time to
time in accordance herewith.

         "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the
greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Base CD Rate in
effect on such day plus 1% and (c) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on
such day plus 1/2 of 1%. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change
in the Prime Rate, the Base CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be
effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime
Rate, the Base CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

         "Applicable Percentage" means, with respect to any Lender, the
percentage of the total Commitments represented by such Lender's Commitment. If
the Commitments have terminated

<PAGE>


or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon the
Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments.

         "Applicable Rate" means with respect to any ABR Loan or Eurodollar
Loan, or with respect to the facility fees payable hereunder, as the case may
be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption "ABR
Spread", "Eurodollar Spread" or "Facility Fee Rate", as the case may be, based
upon the ratings by Moody's and/or S&P, respectively, applicable on such date to
the Index Debt:

<Table>
<Caption>
      INDEX DEBT RATINGS:          ABR SPREAD      EURODOLLAR SPREAD    FACILITY FEE RATE
      -------------------          ----------      -----------------    -----------------
<S>                                <C>             <C>                  <C>

             Tier 1


Greater than or equal to BBB/Baa2      0.00%              0.950%              0.300%

             Tier 2


Equal to BBB-/Baa3                     0.00%              1.125%              0.375%

             Tier 3


Less than BBB-/Baa3                   0.250%              1.250%              0.500%
</Table>


For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not have in
effect a rating for the Index Debt (after having established such a rating and
other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of
this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a
rating in Tier 3; (ii) if both Moody's and S&P have established a rating for the
Index Debt and such ratings established or deemed to have been established by
Moody's and S&P shall fall within different Tiers, the Applicable Rate shall be
based on the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or
more Tiers lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Rate shall be
determined by reference to the Tier next below that of the higher of the two
ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established
by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result
of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be
effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating
agency. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period
commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date
immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating
system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall
cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower
and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to
reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such
rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the
Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in
effect prior to such change or cessation.

effect on such day that is payable by a member of the Bank Insurance Fund

provided that if, as a result of any change in any law, rule or regulation, it
is no longer possible to determine the Assessment Rate as aforesaid, then the
Assessment Rate shall be such annual rate as shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent to be representative of the cost of such insurance to the
Lenders.

         "Assignment and Acceptance" means an assignment and acceptance entered

of a Borrowing comprised entirely of General Revolving Loans or Working Capital

Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an

Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of
$500,000 and not less than $1,000,000; provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in
an aggregate amount that is equal to (i) with respect to Working Capital
Revolving Borrowings, the entire unused and available balance of the Working

outstanding.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the

deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $75,000,000
and (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the
total General Revolving Commitments.

                  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Maturity Date.

                  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without
any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing
Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the
Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage
of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the
Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section,


                                       21
<PAGE>


or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any
reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that
the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an
ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by
the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when
due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and
shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

                  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance


                                       22
<PAGE>


whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that,
if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11(c) shall apply. Interest
accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank,
except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be
for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced


                                       23
<PAGE>


Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall
notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any
such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees
accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.10(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

                  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 66 2/3% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and
sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and
expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on
such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall
be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 66 2/3% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower
is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

         SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available
to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to
an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New


                                       24
<PAGE>


York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement
as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Issuing Bank.

                  (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be
of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing,
and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
Borrowing.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made
on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                           (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election
Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);


                                       25
<PAGE>


                           (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant
to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                           (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                           (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

         SECTION 2.07. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
not less than $5,000,000, (ii) any such reduction shall apply only to the
General Revolving Commitments until such time that the amount of the General
Revolving Commitments equals the amount of the Working Capital Revolving
Sub-Commitments and, thereafter, shall reduce both the General Revolving
Commitments and the Working Capital Revolving Sub-Commitments, and (iii) the
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.09, the
sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.

                  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Commitments


                                       26
<PAGE>


delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction
of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Commitments.

         SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the
Maturity Date.

                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
an increase in such Lender's Commitment pursuant to Section 2.18 or an increase
or reduction in such Lender's Commitment pursuant to an assignment pursuant to
Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is
a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

         SECTION 2.09. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

                  (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days


                                       27
<PAGE>


before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given
in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as
contemplated by Section 2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if
such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly
following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.11 and any break funding payments required by
Section 2.14.

         SECTION 2.10. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitments of such Lender (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the Restatement Effective
Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its
Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the
daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the
date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such
Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall
be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of
each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Original Agreement Date; provided that any
facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall
be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as that applicable to Eurodollar loans on the average daily amount of such
Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed
LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Restatement Effective
Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment
terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and
(ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of
0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Original Effective Date to but excluding the later of the
date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be
any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall
be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Original Effective Date; provided that all
such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments


                                       28
<PAGE>


terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All
participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

         SECTION 2.11. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

                  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the
Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end
of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable
on the effective date of such conversion.

                  (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


                                       29
<PAGE>


         SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining
their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.13. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's


                                       30
<PAGE>


or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions
incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

         SECTION 2.14. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.09(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then,
in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate (in the case of a Eurodollar Loan)
that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of
such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would
have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest
which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate
which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,
for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the
Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or
amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall
be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.


                                       31
<PAGE>


         SECTION 2.15. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make
such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the
Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

         SECTION 2.16. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or
otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All


                                       32
<PAGE>


such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270
Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the
Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in
such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon
than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent
of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph
shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the


                                       33
<PAGE>


Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event,
if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Sections 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b) or 2.16(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

         SECTION 2.18. Procedures Regarding Increases to the Commitments. (a) So
long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Borrower may request from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, that the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Commitments be
increased. Any such request shall be made by written notice to the
Administrative Agent; provided, however, that any such notice must be given no
later than 60 days prior to the Maturity Date. Each such notice (a "Initial
Notice of Commitment Increase") shall be in the form of Exhibit D-1 and specify
therein:

                           (i) the proposed effective date of such increase,
which date (the requested "Commitment Increase Effective Date") shall be no
earlier than forty-five days after receipt by the Administrative Agent of such
notice; and

                           (ii) the amount of the requested increase; provided,
however, that (A) such increase must be at least $10,000,000, (B) after giving
effect to such requested increase, the aggregate amount of the Lenders'
Commitments shall not exceed $225,000,000, (C) such increase shall be applied in
full to the General Revolving Commitments, and (D) the aggregate amount of the
Working Capital Revolving Sub-Commitments, which are a subset of the General
Revolving Commitments, shall not change (notwithstanding that the Working
Capital Revolving Sub-Commitment of a given Lender may change pursuant to the
last sentence of the definition of "Working Capital Revolving Sub-Commitment"
herein).

The Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of such Initial Notice of
Commitment Increase to each Lender via facsimile transmission on or before the
third Business Day next succeeding the date the Administrative Agent receives
such Initial Notice of Commitment Increase. After receipt of the Initial Notice
of Commitment Increase, each Lender shall determine, in its sole discretion,
whether to participate, and to what extent, if any, in such Commitment increase
and shall communicate such decision in writing to the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower on or before the eleventh day prior to the proposed Commitment
Increase Effective Date.

                  (b) On the tenth day prior to the proposed Commitment Increase
Effective Date, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a written
notice confirming the requested increase in the aggregate amount of the Lenders'
Commitments. Each such notice (a "Notice of Confirmation of Commitment
Increase") shall be in the form of Exhibit D-2 and specify therein:

                           (i) the proposed Commitment Increase Effective Date,
which date shall be no earlier than five Business Days after receipt by the
Administrative Agent of such Notice of Confirmation of Commitment Increase;

                           (ii) the amount of the requested increase; provided,
however, that (A) such increase must be at least $10,000,000, (B) after giving
effect to such requested increase, the aggregate amount of the Lenders'
Commitments shall not exceed $225,000,000, (C) such increase shall be applied in
full to the General Revolving Commitments, and (D) the aggregate amount of the
Working Capital Revolving Sub-Commitments, which are a subset of the General
Revolving Commitments, shall not change (notwithstanding that the Working
Capital Revolving Sub-Commitment of a given Lender may change pursuant to the
last sentence of the definition of "Working Capital Revolving Sub-Commitment"
herein);


                                       35
<PAGE>


                           (iii) the identity of each of the then Lenders, if
any, which has agreed with the Borrower to increase its Commitment in an amount
such that its Applicable Percentage after giving effect to such requested
increase will be the same or greater than its Applicable Percentage prior to
giving effect to such requested increase (each such Lender being an "Increasing
Lender"), each of the other then Lenders, if any, which has agreed to increase
its Commitment in an amount such that its Applicable Percentage after giving
effect to such a requested increase will be less than its Applicable Percentage
prior to giving effect to such requested increase (each such Lender being a
"Partially Increasing Lender") and the identity of each financial institution
not already a Lender, if any, which has agreed with the Borrower to become a
Lender to effect such requested increase in the aggregate amount of the Lenders'
Commitments (each such financial institution shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and each such financial institution being a "New
Lender" and each of the other then Lenders, if any, which has not agreed to
increase its Commitment being a "Reducing Lender"); and

                           (iv) the amount of the respective Commitments of the
then existing Lenders, such Increasing Lenders, such Partially Increasing
Lenders, such Reducing Lenders and such New Lenders from and after the effective
date of such increase.

                  (c) On or before each Commitment Increase Effective Date:

                           (i) the Borrower, each Increasing Lender, each
Partially Increasing Lender and each then New Lender shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance, as to form, documentation
embodying the provisions of the Notice of Commitment Increase relating to the
increase in the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Commitments to be effected on
such Commitment Increase Effective Date; and

                           (ii) upon acceptance of such documentation by the
Administrative Agent, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (A)
the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice of such acceptance to each
Lender, (B) it shall become effective, and each Increasing Lender's and
Partially Increasing Lender's Commitment shall be increased to the amount
specified therein, on such Commitment Increase Effective Date and (C) the
Administrative Agent shall record each New Lender's information in the Register.

                  (d) On each Commitment Increase Effective Date:

                           (i) each then New Lender and each then Increasing
Lender shall, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, deliver to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders' New Funds Amount for such Commitment Increase
Effective Date, which amount, for each such Lender, shall constitute Loans made
by such Lender to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.01 on such Commitment
Increase Effective Date; and

                           (ii) the Administrative Agent shall, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, pay to each then Reducing Lender and to each
Partially Increasing Lender its Reduction Amount for such Commitment Increase
Effective Date, which amount, for each such Lender, shall constitute a
prepayment by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.09, ratably in


                                       36
<PAGE>


accordance with the respective principal amounts thereof, of the principal
amounts of all then outstanding Loans of such Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall record each then New Lender's, each then
Increasing Lender's and each then Partially Increasing Lender's information in
the Register. Also effective as of each Commitment Increase Effective Date, each
then New Lender and each then Increasing Lender shall be deemed to have
purchased and had transferred to it, and each then Reducing Lender and each
Partially Increasing Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred as
provided in Section 2.04(d) to such New Lenders and Increasing Lenders, such
undivided interest and participation in such Reducing Lender's and such
Partially Increasing Lender's interest and participation in all then outstanding
Letters of Credit, to the extent necessary so that such undivided interests and
participations of all Lenders (including each New Lender) shall accord with
their respective Applicable Percentages after giving effect to the increase in
the aggregate amount of the Lenders' Commitments on such Commitment Increase
Effective Date.

                                   ARTICLE III
                         Representations and Warranties

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

         SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

         SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are
within the Borrower's partnership powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate, limited liability company or partnership and, if required,
stockholder, member or limited partner action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

         SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any
applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries.


                                       37
<PAGE>


         SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income, partners equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, reported on by independent public
accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, certified by its chief financial officer.
Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in
accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

                  (b) Since December 31, 2001, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal
property material to its business, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Encumbrances and Liens otherwise permitted or contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, or has made all required federal filings (and has not been
notified of any contest) with respect to, all trademarks, tradenames,
copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business,
and the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon
the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

                  (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any
Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or
other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to
any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect
to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

                  (c) Since the Restatement Effective Date, there has been no
change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.


                                       38
<PAGE>


         SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of
any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined
in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The Borrower is not subject to regulation
under any Federal or State statute or regulation which limits its ability to
incur Indebtedness.

         SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have
been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been
paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.10. ERISA. Each ERISA Affiliate has fulfilled its obligations
under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each
Plan and is in compliance in all material respects with the presently applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan. No ERISA Affiliate
has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the
Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to make any contribution or payment to
any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any Benefit Arrangement or made
any amendment to any Plan or Benefit Arrangement, which has resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a
bond or other security under ERISA or the Code or (iii) incurred any liability
under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under
Section 4007 of ERISA.

         SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the other
reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or
on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

         SECTION 3.12. Investments and Guarantees. As of the Restatement
Effective Date, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any Investments or
has outstanding any Guarantees,


                                       39
<PAGE>


except as permitted by this Agreement or reflected in the financial statements
described in Section 3.04(a).

         SECTION 3.13. Subsidiaries. As of the Restatement Effective Date, the
Borrower has no Subsidiaries.

         SECTION 3.14. Casualties; Taking of Property. Neither the business nor

affected as a result of any fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, drought,
windstorm, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, embargo, requisition or
taking of any assets or cancellation of contracts, permits or concessions by any
domestic or foreign government or any agency thereof, riot, activities of armed
forces or acts of God or of any public enemy.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                   Conditions

         SECTION 4.01. Conditions to Restatement. The closing and effectiveness

Adverse Effect; and

                  (b) conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling
and testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions required under
Environmental Laws and promptly comply with all lawful orders and directives of
all Governmental Authorities regarding Environmental Laws except to the extent
that the same are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
the pendency of such proceedings could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.10. Clean-Down. The Borrower will cause the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of the Working Capital Revolving Loans, the
proceeds of which were used to pay Restricted Payments, to be zero for a period
of at least 15 consecutive days during each calendar year.

         SECTION 5.11. Subsidiaries. The Borrower will, substantially
contemporaneously with its formation or acquisition, cause each Subsidiary

the Borrower under this Agreement by executing and delivering to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a Subsidiary Guaranty,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2. The Borrower shall, or shall cause
such Subsidiary to, further deliver any and all instruments, documents,

                  (c) Liens on fixed or capital assets acquired, constructed or
improved by the Borrower or any Subsidiary; provided that (i) such security
interest secures Indebtedness permitted by clause (d) of Section 6.01, (ii) such
security interests and the Indebtedness secured thereby are incurred prior to or
within 90 days after such acquisition or the completion of such construction or
improvement, (iii) the Indebtedness secured thereby does not exceed the cost of

thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing (i) any Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower in a
transaction in which the Borrower is the surviving corporation or the Borrower
may merge with another Person so long as (A) the surviving entity or purchaser,
if other than the Borrower, assumes, pursuant to the terms of such transaction,
each of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under any other documents
entered into in connection with the Loans and (B) each such assumption is
expressly evidenced by an agreement executed and delivered to the Lenders in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) any Subsidiary
may merge into any Subsidiary in a transaction in which the surviving entity is
a Subsidiary, and (iii) any Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve if the Borrower

existing on the Restatement Agreement Date identified on Schedule 6.08 (but

agreed to after the Restatement Agreement Date; provided that such restrictions
or conditions are not more restrictive than the restrictions and conditions
existing on the Restatement Agreement Date, (iii) the foregoing shall not apply

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 6.10. Creation of Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not at any
time create or acquire any Subsidiary unless Borrower has caused such Subsidiary
to comply with the requirements of Section 5.11.

any report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished
pursuant to or in connection with the Loan Documents or any

or agent for such holders, to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable
prior to its expressed maturity.

                  (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or

lease, manage or otherwise operate any properties or assets (including cash and
cash equivalents), other than (A) the limited partner interests in the Borrower,
(B) ownership interests (not to exceed 1% in each such case) of a Subsidiary,

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower

during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                            The Administrative Agent

         Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

         The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

         The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving
as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)
any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.


                                       53
<PAGE>


         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a Lender and a
commercial bank with an office in New York, New York and having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or an Affiliate of any such bank.
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  Miscellaneous

         SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

                  (a) if to the Borrower, to it at One Valero Place, San
Antonio, Texas 78212, Attention of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer (Telecopy No. (210) 592-2010);

                  (b) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank,
Loan and Agency Services Group, 1111 Fannin, 8th Floor, Houston, TX 77002,
Attention of Maria Arreola (Telecopy No. (713) 750-2228);

                  (c) if to the Issuing Bank, to it at JPMorgan Chase Bank,

                  (d) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

         SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that
they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any


                                       55
<PAGE>


fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a
manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,
without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions
of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision
hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend
or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

         SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (a) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby (including the MLP
Guaranty), the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto; provided that such


                                       56
<PAGE>


indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not
later than 5 Business Days after written demand therefor.

         SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender,
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an
assignment of all or a portion of a Commitment or any Lender's obligations in
respect of its LC Exposure and the Issuing Bank) must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
(ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and


                                       57
<PAGE>


Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the

Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v)
the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any consent of
the Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. Any assignment of
a given percentage of a Lender's General Revolving Commitment shall cover the
same percentage of such Lender's Working Capital Revolving Commitment, and vice
versa.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment
of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a


                                       58
<PAGE>


"Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.15(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of


                                       59
<PAGE>


the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other required parties hereto, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

         SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions


                                       60
<PAGE>


by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

                  (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or


                                       61
<PAGE>


(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the
purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the
Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the
Original Agreement Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

         SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

SECTION 9.14. Limitation of Liability. Neither the General Partner nor the
general partner(s) of the MLP shall be liable for (a) the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement or (b) the obligations of the MLP under the MLP
Guaranty, including in each case, without limitation, by reason of any payment
obligation imposed by governing state partnership statutes and any provision of
the applicable limited partnership agreement of the Borrower or the MLP that
requires such General Partner or general partner(s), as the case may be, to
restore a capital account deficit.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the Restatement
Agreement Date.

                       OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER

                                                                   March 6, 2003

To the Lenders and the Administrative
   Agent Referred to Below
c/o The Chase Manhattan Bank, as
   Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10017

Dear Sirs:

         [I/We] have acted as counsel for Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. (the
"Borrower") and Valero, L.P. (the "MLP", and together with the Borrower, the
"Loan Parties"), in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of December
15, 2000 as amended and restated through March 6, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"),
among the Borrower, the banks and other financial institutions identified
therein as Lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent and the
other Loan Documents identified below. This opinion is being furnished to you
pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein,
terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Credit Agreement.

         In that connection, we have examined executed copies of the Credit
Agreement, the MLP Guaranty, and the notes executed and delivered on the date
hereof pursuant to Section 2.08(e) of the Credit Agreement (the "Loan
Documents").

         In addition, [I, or individuals under my direction,/We] have examined
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to [my/our] satisfaction,
of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as
[I/we] have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

         Upon the basis of the foregoing, [I am/we are] of the opinion that:

1.       The Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
         of the Loan Parties party thereto, enforceable against such Loan
         Parties under the law of the State of New York in accordance with their
         respective terms.

2.       In a case properly argued and presented, a Texas court or a Federal
         court sitting in Texas and applying Texas conflict of law principles,
         as set out in Section 35.51 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code,
         would give effect to the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the MLP
         Guaranty selecting New York law as governing, and would apply the
         substantive laws of the State of New York in construing the Credit
         Agreement and the MLP Guaranty.

3.       Under the circumstances contemplated by the Credit Agreement, the
         making of the Loans will not violate Section 7 of the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any


                                  Exhibit B - 1

<PAGE>


         regulation issued pursuant thereto, including without limitation, the
         provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
         Federal Reserve System.

4.       The Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the
         Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

5.       The Borrower is not subject to, or is exempt from, regulation as a
         "holding company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
         as amended.

6.       The Borrower (a) is a limited partnership duly formed and validly
         existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (b) has the
         limited partnership power and authority to (i) own property and conduct
         the business in which it is currently engaged and in which it proposes,
         as of the date hereof, to be engaged after the date hereof, (ii) make,
         deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party in
         accordance with the terms and provisions thereof and (iii) borrow under
         the Credit Agreement.

7.       The MLP (a) is a limited partnership duly formed and validly existing
         under the laws of the State of Delaware and (b) has the limited
         partnership power and authority to (i) own property and conduct the
         business in which it is currently engaged and in which it proposes, as
         of the date hereof, to be engaged after the date hereof, and (ii) make,
         deliver and perform the MLP Guaranty in accordance with the terms and
         provisions thereof.

8.       The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement by the
         Borrower, and of the MLP Guaranty by the MLP, and the borrowings by the
         Borrower under the Credit Agreement, have been duly authorized by all
         necessary actions on behalf of the Loan Parties and each other Person
         whose authorization is relevant to, or constitutes, authorization on
         behalf of either Loan Party.

9.       The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of
         the Loan Parties, as applicable.

10.      No approvals or consents of any governmental authority of the State of
         Texas or the United States of America or other consents or approvals by
         any other Person which have not been obtained on or prior to the date
         hereof are required (a) in connection with the participation by the
         Loan Parties in connection with the transactions under the Loan
         Documents or the execution, delivery and performance by either Loan
         Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, or (b) for the
         validity and enforceability of the Loan Documents and the exercise by
         the Lenders of their rights and remedies thereunder.

11.      The execution, delivery and performance by the Loan Parties of the Loan
         Documents will not (a) violate any provision of the Partnership
         Agreement (Borrower), or the Partnership Agreement (MLP), (b) result in
         the breach of, or constitute a default under, any indenture or loan or
         credit agreement or any other material agreement, lease or instrument,
         known to me after due inquiry, to which either of the Loan Parties is a
         party or by which its properties may be bound, (c) result in, or
         require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its
         properties or revenues pursuant to any requirement of law, rule
         regulation or order of any governmental authority of the State of Texas
         or the United States of America or material contractual obligation
         binding upon either Loan Party, or (d) result in any violation by
         either Loan Party of any applicable law of the State of Texas or the
         United States of America.

12.      The partnership interests in the Borrower listed on Schedule A hereto
         constitute all the partnership interests of record in the Borrower and
         are owned of record by the Persons designated on Schedule A.


                                  Exhibit B - 2

<PAGE>


13.      The Borrower is not subject to regulation under any statute or
         regulation of the State of Texas or the United States of America that
         limits its ability to incur indebtedness.

14.      To my knowledge (having made due inquiry with respect thereto), no
         litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or
         governmental authority is pending or threatened by or against the MLP
         or the Borrower or against any of the properties or revenues of either
         (a) with respect to the Loan Documents or any of the transactions
         contemplated thereby or (b) which, if adversely determined, could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                              SECTION 2. GUARANTEE

         2.1 Guarantee. (a) The Parent Guarantor, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, (i) absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably,
guarantees to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt
and complete payment and performance by the Borrower when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations and
(ii) indemnifies and holds harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender
from, and agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses)
incurred by the Administrative Agent

                                  Exhibit C-1-2
<PAGE>


or such Lender in enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement. The Parent
Guarantor agrees that notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing the payment by the Borrower of all or any portion of the Borrower
Obligations and notwithstanding that all or any portion of the Borrower
Obligations may be unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Borrower, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, such Borrower Obligations shall
nevertheless be due and payable by the Parent Guarantor for the purposes of this
Agreement at the time such Borrower Obligations would by payable by the Borrower
under the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
enforcement of this Agreement with respect to the rights of any Lender shall be
accomplished by the Administrative Agent acting on behalf of such Lender.

         (b) The guarantee contained in this Section 2.1 is a continuing
guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until all the Borrower
Obligations and the obligations of the Parent Guarantor under the guarantee
contained in this Section 2.1 shall have been satisfied by payment in full, no
Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments shall be terminated,
notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement
the Borrower may be free from any Borrower Obligations.

         (c) No payment made by the Borrower, the Parent Guarantor, any other
guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender from the Borrower, the Parent Guarantor, any other guarantor
or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or
appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or
in payment of the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce,
release or otherwise affect the liability of the Parent Guarantor hereunder
which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by
the Borrower or Parent Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or any
payment received or collected from the Borrower or Parent Guarantor in respect
of the Borrower Obligations), remain liable for the Borrower Obligations until,
subject to Section 2.5, the Borrower Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of
Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are terminated.

         2.2 Subrogation. The Parent Guarantor shall be subrogated to all the
rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower in respect
of any amounts paid by the Parent Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Parent Guarantor shall not be entitled to
enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of
subrogation with respect to any of the Borrower Obligations until all of the
Borrower Obligations and the Guarantees thereof shall have been indefeasibly
paid in full or discharged. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as
such, of the Parent Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations
of the Guarantor under this Agreement or any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation.

         2.3 Amendments, etc. with respect to the Borrower Obligations. The
Parent Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without
any reservation of rights against the Parent Guarantor and without notice to or
further assent by the Parent Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the
Borrower Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be
rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Borrower
Obligations continued, and the Borrower Obligations, or the liability of any
other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or
guarantee


                                  Exhibit C-1-3
<PAGE>


therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in
whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated,
compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, and the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended,
modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative
Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem
advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of
offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the
payment of the Borrower Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered
or released. Except as required by applicable law, neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or
insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Borrower Obligations
or for the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or any property subject
thereto.

         2.4 Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Parent Guarantor hereby (i) waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, notice of acceptance, filing of claims with a
court in the event of the merger, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Borrower or
the Parent Guarantor, and all demands and notices whatsoever, (ii) acknowledges
that any agreement, instrument or document evidencing the Parent Guarantor
Obligations may be transferred and that the benefit of its obligations hereunder
shall extend to each holder of any agreement, instrument or document evidencing
the Parent Guarantor Obligations without notice to them and (iii) covenants that
the Parent Guarantor Obligations will not be discharged except by complete
performance thereof. The Parent Guarantor further agrees that to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, if at any time all or any part of any
payment theretofore applied by any Person to any of the Parent Guarantor
Obligations is, or must be, rescinded or returned for any reason whatsoever,
including without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
the Parent Guarantor, such Parent Guarantor Obligations shall, to the extent
that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have
continued in existence notwithstanding such application, and the Parent
Guarantor Obligations shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, as though such application had not been made.

         To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of
the Parent Guarantor under this Agreement shall be as aforesaid full,
irrevocable, unconditional and absolute and shall not be impaired, modified,
discharged, released or limited by any occurrence or condition whatsoever,
including, without limitation, (i) any compromise, settlement, release, waiver,
renewal, extension, indulgence or modification of, or any change in, any of the
obligations and liabilities of the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor contained in
any of the Borrower Obligations or this Agreement, (ii) any impairment,
modification, release or limitation of the liability of the Borrower, the Parent
Guarantor or any of their estates in bankruptcy, or any remedy for the
enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future
provision of any applicable bankruptcy law, as amended, or other statute or from
the decision of any court, (iii) the assertion or exercise by the Borrower or
the Parent Guarantor of any rights or remedies under any of the Borrower
Obligations or this Agreement or their delay in or failure to assert or exercise
any such rights or remedies, (iv) the assignment or the purported assignment of
any property as security for any of the Borrower Obligations, including all or
any part of the rights of the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor under this
Agreement, (v) the extension of the time for payment by the Borrower or the
Parent Guarantor of any payments or other sums or any part


                                  Exhibit C-1-4
<PAGE>


thereof owing or payable under any of the terms and provisions of any of the
Borrower Obligations or this Agreement or of the time for performance by the
Borrower or the Parent Guarantor of any other obligations under or arising out
of any such terms and provisions or the extension or the renewal of any thereof,
(vi) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any duty,
agreement or obligation of the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor set forth in
this Agreement, (vii) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution,
sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets, marshaling
of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for
the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or
readjustment of, or other similar proceeding affecting, the Borrower or any of
the Parent Guarantor or any of their respective assets, or the disaffirmance of
any of the Borrower Obligations, or this Agreement in any such proceeding,
(viii) the release or discharge of the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor from the
performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term or condition
contained in any of such instruments by operation of law, (ix) the
unenforceability of any of the Borrower Obligations or this Agreement, (x) any
change in the name, business, capital structure, corporate existence, or
ownership of the Borrower or the Parent Guarantor, or (xi) any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal
or equitable discharge of, a surety or the Parent Guarantor.

         2.5 Reinstatement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall continue to be effective, or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of
any of the Borrower Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or
returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or the
Parent Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver,
intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or
the Parent Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all
as though such payments had not been made.

         2.6 Payments. The Parent Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments
hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or
counterclaim and without deduction for any taxes and in immediately available
funds and in Dollars at the Administrative Agent 's payment office at the
address provided in Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement.

                    SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent Guarantor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         3.3 Government Approvals; No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement (a) do not require any consent or approval of,
registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority,

of any Lien on any asset of the Parent Guarantor.

full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and the Parent

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or

cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any
other rights or remedies provided by law.

         6.4 Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Parent Guarantor

                              SECTION 2. GUARANTEE

         2.1 Guarantee. (a) Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and
severally, (i) absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective
successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment
and performance by the Borrower when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations and (ii) indemnifies and
holds harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender from, and agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender in enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement. The
guarantee in this Section 2.1 is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all
Obligations owing at any time whenever arising or incurred and shall remain in
full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full.
Each Guarantor agrees that notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing the payment by the Borrower of all or any portion of the
Borrower Obligations and notwithstanding that all or any portion of the Borrower
Obligations may be unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Borrower, such
Borrower Obligations shall nevertheless be due and payable by such Guarantor for
the purposes of this Agreement at the time such Borrower Obligations would by
payable by the Borrower under the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any enforcement of this Agreement with respect to
the rights of any Lender may be accomplished by the Administrative Agent acting
on behalf of such Lender.

         (b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no
event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under
applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors (after
giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.2).

         (c) Each Guarantor agrees that the Borrower Obligations may at any time
and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor
hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or
affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
hereunder.

         (d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2.1 shall remain in full
force and effect until all the Borrower Obligations and the obligations of each
Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2.1 shall have been
satisfied by payment in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the
Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during
the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower may be free from any Borrower
Obligations.


                                  Exhibit C-2-3
<PAGE>

         (e) No payment made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other
guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender from the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other
guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any
set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in
reduction of or in payment of the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to
modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor
hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment
made by such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or any payment
received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower
Obligations), remain liable for the Borrower Obligations up to the maximum
liability of such Guarantor hereunder until, subject to Section 2.6, the
Borrower Obligations are paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding
and the Commitments are terminated.

         2.2 Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the
extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any
payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive
contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid
its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.3. The provisions of
this Section 2.2 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of
any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and each Guarantor
shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the full
amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.

         2.3 No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor
hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be
subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or
guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for
the payment of the Borrower Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be
entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any
other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until
all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower on
account of the Borrower Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full, no Letter of
Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount
shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time
when all of the Borrower Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such
amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith
upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in
the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to
the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Borrower
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative
Agent may determine.

         2.4 Amendments, etc. with respect to the Borrower Obligations. Each
Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any
reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further
assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Borrower
Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Borrower Obligations
continued, and the Borrower Obligations, or the liability of any other Person
upon or for any part


                                  Exhibit C-2-4
<PAGE>


thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset
with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed,
extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or
released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and the Credit Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in
connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in
whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders or all
Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any
collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Borrower Obligations
may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect,
secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the
Borrower Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or any
property subject thereto.

         2.5 Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any and
all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Borrower
Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or acceptance of the
guarantee contained in this Section 2; the Borrower Obligations, and any of
them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred,
or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee
contained in this Section 2; and all dealings between the Borrower and any of
the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2. Each
Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice
of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the Guarantors with
respect to the Borrower Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that
the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing,
absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the
validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document,
any of the Borrower Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or
guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to
time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or
counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any
time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) any extension, other indulgence,
renewal, settlement, discharge, compromise, waiver, subordination or release in
respect of any Borrower Obligation, security, Person or otherwise, (d) any
modification or amendment of or supplement to the Borrower Obligations,
including any increase or decrease in the principal, the rates of interest or
other amounts payable thereunder, (e) any release, non-perfection or invalidity
of any direct or indirect security for any Borrower Obligation, (f) any change
in the existence, structure, constitution, name, objects, powers, business,
control or ownership of the Borrower or any other Person, or any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or
any other Person or its assets, (g) any limitation, postponement, prohibition,
subordination or other restriction on the rights of the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders to payment of the Borrower Obligations, (h) any release,
substitution or addition of any cosigner, endorser or other guarantor of the
Borrower Obligations, (i) any defense arising by reason of any failure of the
Borrower to make any presentment, demand for performance, notice of
non-performance, protest, and any other notice, including notice of all of the
following: acceptance of this Agreement, partial payment or non-payment of all
or any part of the Borrower Obligations and the existence,


                                  Exhibit C-2-5
<PAGE>


creation, or incurring of new or additional Borrower Obligations, (j) any
defense arising by reason of any failure of the Administrative Agent to proceed
against the Borrower or any other Person, to proceed against, apply or exhaust
any security held from the Borrower or any other Person for the Borrower
Obligations, to proceed against, apply or exhaust any security held from any
Guarantor or any other Person for this Agreement or to pursue any other remedy
in the power of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders whatsoever, (k) any law
which provides that the obligation of a guarantor must neither be larger in
amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal
obligation or which reduces a guarantor's obligation in proportion to the
principal obligation, (l) any defense arising by reason of any incapacity, lack
of authority, or other defense of the Borrower or any other Person, or by reason
of any limitation, postponement, prohibition on the Administrative Agent's or
the Lenders' right to payment of the Borrower Obligations or any part thereof,
or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the
Borrower or any other Person with respect to all or any part of the Borrower
Obligations, or by reason of any act or omission of the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders which directly or indirectly results in the discharge or release of
the Borrower or any other Person of all or any part of the Borrower Obligations
or any security or guarantee therefore, whether by contract, operation of law or
otherwise, (m) any defense arising by failure by the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders to obtain, perfect or maintain a perfected or prior (or any) security
interest in or lien or encumbrance upon any property of the Borrower or any
other Person, or by reason of any interest of the Borrower in any property,
whether as owner thereof or the holder of a security interest therein or lien or
encumbrance thereon, being invalidated, voided, declared fraudulent or
preferential or otherwise set aside, or by reason of any impairment by the
Borrower of any right to recourse or collateral, (n) any defense arising by
reason of the failure of the Borrower to marshal any assets, (o) any defense
based upon any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give to the
Borrower or any Guarantor notice of any sale or other disposition of any
property securing any or all of the Obligations, or any defect in any notice
that may be given in connection with any sale or other disposition of any such
property, or any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply
with any provision of applicable law in enforcing any security interest in or
lien upon any such property, including any failure of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to dispose of any such property in a commercially reasonable
manner, (p) any dealing whatsoever with the Borrower or other Person or any
security, whether negligently or not, or any failure to do so, (q) any defense
based upon or arising out any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution
proceeding commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Person, including
any discharge of, or bar against collecting, any of the Borrower Obligations, in
or as a result of any such proceeding, (r) or any other act or omission to act
or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any
Guarantor or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever, whether
similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, which might, but for the provisions of
this Section 2.5, constitute a legal or equitable discharge, limitation or
reduction of such Guarantor's obligations hereunder (other than the payment in
full of all of the Borrower Obligations). The foregoing provisions apply (and
the foregoing waivers will be effective) even if the effect of any action (or
failure to take any action) by the Administrative Agent or any Lender is to
destroy or diminish a Guarantor's subrogation rights, such Guarantor's right to
proceed against the Borrower for reimbursement, such Guarantor's right to
recover contribution from any other Guarantor or any other right or remedy. When
making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies
hereunder


                                  Exhibit C-2-6

<PAGE>

against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be
under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights
and remedies as it may have against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any
other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Borrower
Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other
rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower, any other
Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or
guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the
Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral
security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any
obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and
remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes
hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal
proceedings.

         2.6 Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall
continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Borrower Obligations is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of
the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the
Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise,
all as though such payments had not been made.

         2.7 Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder
will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim and
without deduction for any taxes and in immediately available funds and in
Dollars at the Administrative Agent 's payment office at the address provided in
Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement.

                    SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into the
Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions
of credit to the Borrower thereunder, each Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

         3.1 Representations in Credit Agreement. In the case of each Guarantor,
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 of the Credit
Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor or to which such Guarantor is a
party, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and
correct, and the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely
on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein. Each Guarantor also
represents and warrants that it is Solvent.

                              SECTION 4. COVENANTS

         Each Guarantor covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Obligations shall have been paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be
outstanding and the Commitments shall have terminated, in the case


                                  Exhibit C-2-7
<PAGE>


of each Guarantor, such Guarantor shall take, or shall refrain from taking, as
the case may be, each action that is necessary to be taken or not taken, as the
case may be, so that no Default or Event of Default is caused by the failure to
take such action or to refrain from taking such action by such Guarantor or any
of its Subsidiaries.

                       SECTION 5. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         5.1 Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Guarantor acknowledges that
the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement
with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or
non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request,
judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising
out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with
respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the
Administrative Agent and the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid
authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Guarantor shall be under any
obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

                            SECTION 6. MISCELLANEOUS

         6.1 Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in
accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.

         6.2 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
Administrative Agent or any Guarantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner
provided for in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such
notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such
Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1.

         6.3 No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written
instrument pursuant to Section 6.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be
deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any
Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in
exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise
have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any
other rights or remedies provided by law.

         6.4 Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Guarantor agrees to
pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its costs and
expenses incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under the guarantee
contained in Section 2 or otherwise

of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house counsel) to
each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent.

         (b) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement to the same extent
the Borrower would be required to do so pursuant to Section 9.03 of the Credit
Agreement.

         (c) The agreements in this Section 6.4 shall survive repayment of the
Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

         6.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of each Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their successors and assigns; provided
that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.

         6.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by

constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement
signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of

manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
