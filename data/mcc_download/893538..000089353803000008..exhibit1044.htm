                   --------------------------------
part  of a  Borrowing  consisting  of  Loans  made  by the  Lenders  ratably  in
accordance with their respective Commitments.  The failure of any Lender to make
any Loan  required to be made by it shall not  relieve  any other  Lender of its
obligations  hereunder;  provided that the Commitments are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

                   --------------
be  comprised  entirely of ABR Loans or  Eurodollar  Loans as the  Borrower  may
request  in  accordance  herewith.  Each  Lender  at its  option  may  make  any
Eurodollar  Loan by causing any domestic or foreign  branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan;  provided  that any  exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance  with the

Borrowing  shall be in an  aggregate  amount  that is an  integral  multiple  of
$1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000.  At the time that each ABR Borrowing is
made,  such  Borrowing  shall  be in an  aggregate  amount  that is an  integral
multiple  of  $500,000  and  not  less  than  $1,000,000;  provided  that an ABR
Borrowing  may be in an  aggregate  amount  that is equal to the  entire  unused
balance  of  the  total   Commitments   or  that  is  required  to  finance  the
reimbursement  of  an  LC  Disbursement  as  contemplated  by  Section  2.08(e).
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding  at the same time;  provided
that  there  shall  not at any time be more  than a total of six (6)  Eurodollar
Borrowings  outstanding.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the  Borrower  shall not be  entitled  to  request,  or to elect to  convert  or

hereto in connection  with an increase in the Aggregate  Commitment  pursuant to
Section 2.06(c), as of the effective date of such increase, payable to the order
of such Lender in a principal  amount  equal to its  Commitment  as in effect on
such  date,  and  otherwise  duly  completed.  In the  event  that any  Lender's
Commitment  increases or decreases for any reason  (whether  pursuant to Section

                                       21

2.06, Section 12.04(b) or otherwise),  the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be
delivered on the effective date of such increase or decrease, a new Note payable
to the order of such Lender in a principal  amount equal to its Commitment after
giving effect to such increase or decrease,  and otherwise duly  completed.  The
date, amount,  Type,  interest rate and, if applicable,  Interest Period of each
Loan made by each  Lender,  and all  payments  made on account of the  principal
thereof,  shall be recorded by such Lender on its books for its Note, and, prior
to any transfer,  may be endorsed by such Lender on a schedule  attached to such
Note or any  continuation  thereof or on any separate record  maintained by such
Lender.  Failure to make any such  notation  or to attach a  schedule  shall not
affect any Lender's or the  Borrower's  rights or obligations in respect of such
Loans or affect the validity of such transfer by any Lender of its Note.

          which  funds  are  to  be  disbursed,  which  shall  comply  with  the
          requirements of Section 2.05.

If no election as to the Type of  Borrowing  is  specified,  then the  requested
Borrowing  shall be an ABR  Borrowing.  If no Interest  Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed
to have  selected an Interest  Period of one month's  duration.  Each  Borrowing
Request  shall  constitute  a  representation  that the amount of the  requested

          specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(iii) and (iv) shall be specified
          for each resulting Borrowing);

selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

               (d)  Notice to  Lenders  by the  Administrative  Agent.  Promptly

and Events of Default on Interest  Election.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a
-------------------------------------------
timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to
the end of the Interest Period applicable  thereto,  then, unless such Borrowing
is repaid as provided herein,  at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing
shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding  any contrary provision
hereof,  if an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing:  (i)  no
outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing
and (ii) unless repaid,  each Eurodollar  Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR

made  by it  hereunder  on  the  proposed  date  thereof  by  wire  transfer  of
immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m. Charlotte,  North Carolina time, to the
account of the  Administrative  Agent most  recently  designated  by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in
Charlotte,  North  Carolina and  designated  by the  Borrower in the  applicable
Borrowing Request;  provided that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC  Disbursement  as  provided  in Section  2.08(e)  shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

               (b)   Presumption   of  Funding  by  the   Lenders.   Unless  the
                     --------------------------------------------
Administrative  Agent shall have received  written notice from a Lender prior to
the proposed date of any Borrowing  that such Lender will not make  available to
the   Administrative   Agent  such  Lender's  share  of  such   Borrowing,   the
Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share  available
on such date in accordance  with Section  2.05(a) and may, in reliance upon such
assumption,  make  available to the  Borrower a  corresponding  amount.  In such
event,  if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the  applicable  Borrowing
available  to the  Administrative  Agent,  then the  applicable  Lender  and the
Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date
of payment to the  Administrative  Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the

Administrative  Agent in  accordance  with banking  industry  rules on interbank
compensation  or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,  the interest rate applicable
to ABR  Loans;  provided,  however,  such  demands  shall be made first upon the
                --------   -------
applicable Lender and then upon the Borrower. If such Lender pays such amount to
the  Administrative  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          the Borrower  shall not terminate or reduce the  Aggregate  Commitment
          if, after giving effect to any  concurrent  prepayment of the Loans in
          accordance  with  Section  3.04(c),  the  Aggregate  Revolving  Credit
          Exposures would exceed the Aggregate Commitments.

                    (ii) The Borrower shall notify the  Administrative  Agent of
          any  election to terminate or reduce the  Aggregate  Commitment  under
          Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the effective
          date of such  termination or reduction,  specifying  such election and

          -----------

                         (A) in the case of a Scheduled  Redetermination  (1) if
the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering Reports required to
be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and
complete  manner, then on or before March 15th and  September 15th of such  year
following the date of delivery or 66. if the Administrative Agent shall not have
received  the  Engineering  Reports  required to be  delivered by  the  Borrower
pursuant to Section 8.12(a)  and  (c) in a  timely  and  complete  manner,  then
promptly  after  the   Administrative  Agent  has  received complete Engineering
Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable  opportunity to determine the
Proposed  Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i); and

promptly, and  in any  event, within fifteen (15) days after  the Administrative
Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.

                    (iii) Any Proposed  Borrowing  Base that would  increase the
          Borrowing  Base then in effect must be approved or deemed to have been
          approved  by  all  of  the   Lenders  as  provided  in  this   Section
          2.07(c)(iii);  and any Proposed  Borrowing Base that would decrease or

          deemed to have been  approved by the  Majority  Lenders as provided in
          this Section 2.07(c)(iii). Upon receipt of the Proposed Borrowing Base
          Notice,  each Lender  shall have  fifteen  (15) days to agree with the
          Proposed  Borrowing Base or disagree with the Proposed  Borrowing Base

          fifteen  (15) days,  any Lender has not  communicated  its approval or
          disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence shall
          be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base. If, at the
          end of  such  15-day  period,  all of the  Lenders,  in the  case of a
          Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in

          Base that  would  decrease  or  maintain  the  Borrowing  Base then in

          the  Proposed  Borrowing  Base shall  become the new  Borrowing  Base,
          effective on the date specified in Section  2.07(d).  If, however,  at
          the end of such  15-day  period,  all of the  Lenders or the  Majority
          Lenders, as applicable,  have not approved or deemed to have approved,
          as   aforesaid,   then  for  purposes  of  this  Section   2.07,   the
          Administrative  Agent shall poll the Lenders to ascertain  the highest
          Borrowing Base then acceptable (aa) to the Majority  Lenders,  if such
          amount would  decrease the Borrowing  Base then in effect,  or (bb) to
          all of the Lenders,  if such amount would  increase the Borrowing Base
          then in effect,  which  amount shall  become the new  Borrowing  Base,
          effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d).

complete  manner, then  no later than  April 30 or  October  31, as  applicable,
following  such  notice,  or (2) if  the  Administrative  Agent  shall not  have
received  the  Engineering  Reports  required  to be delivered  by the  Borrower

Redetermination  Date,  the  next  Interim  Redetermination  Date  or  the  next
adjustment  to the  Borrowing  Base under Section  8.13(c),  Section  9.12(a) or
Section  9.13,  whichever  occurs  first.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no

continuance  of a Default or reduction or termination  of the  Commitments,  and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,  withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

               (e)  Reimbursement.  If  the  Issuing  Bank  shall  make  any  LC
                    -------------
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement  not later than 2:00 p.m.,  Charlotte,  North Carolina time, on the
date that such LC  Disbursement  is made,  if the Borrower  shall have  received
notice of such LC  Disbursement  prior to 2:00 p.m.,  Charlotte,  North Carolina

Carolina  time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower  receives such notice,
if such notice is received prior to 12:00 noon, Charlotte,  North Carolina time,
on the day of receipt,  or (ii) the Business Day  immediately  following  the day
that the Borrower  receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to
such time on the day of receipt;  provided that if such LC  Disbursement  is not
less than  $1,000,000,  the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to Borrowing
set forth herein,  request in accordance  with Section 2.03 that such payment be
financed  with a ABR  Borrowing  in an  equivalent  amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR  Borrowing.  If the Borrower  makes such a request
(and if the Borrower  fails to make such a request and has not made the relevant
reimbursement,   it  shall  be  deemed  to  have  made  such  a  request),   the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the  payment  then due from the  Borrower in respect  thereof and such  Lender's
Applicable  Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Lender shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent its Applicable  Percentage of the
payment  then due from the  Borrower,  in the same manner as provided in Section
2.05 with  respect to Loans made by such Lender (and  Section  2.05 shall apply,
mutatis  mutandis,  to  the  payment  obligations  of  the  Lenders),   and  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  pay to the  Issuing  Bank the amounts so
received  by  it  from  the   Lenders.   Promptly   following   receipt  by  the
Administrative  Agent of any payment from the Borrower  pursuant to this Section
2.08(e),  the Administrative  Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments  pursuant to this Section
2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank
as their interests may appear.

               (f) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse
                   --------------------
LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under any and all  circumstances  whatsoever and  irrespective of
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability  of any Letter of Credit,  any Letter
of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein,(ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent  or invalid in any respect or any  statement  therein being untrue or
inaccurate  in any  respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit  against  presentation  of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such  Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit  Agreement,  or
(iv)any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the  foregoing,  that might,  but for the  provisions  of this Section  2.08(f),
constitute  a legal or  equitable  discharge  of,  or  provide a right of setoff
against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank,  nor any of their  Related  Parties shall have
any liability or  responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance
or  transfer  of any  Letter of Credit or any  payment  or  failure  to make any
payment thereunder  (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the
preceding  sentence),  or any error,  omission,  interruption,  loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft,  notice or other  communication  under or
relating  to any Letter of Credit  (including  any  document  required to make a
drawing  thereunder),  any error in  interpretation  of  technical  terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided
that the  foregoing  shall not be  construed  to excuse  the  Issuing  Bank from
liability  to the  Borrower  to the extent of any direct  damages (as opposed to
consequential  damages,  claims in  respect  of which are  hereby  waived by the
Borrower to the extent  permitted by  applicable  law)  suffered by the Borrower
that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when  determining
whether  drafts and other  documents  presented  under a Letter of Credit comply

                                       31

with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence
of gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall
be deemed to have  exercised all requisite care in each such  determination.  In
furtherance of the foregoing and without  limiting the generality  thereof,  the
parties agree that,  with respect to documents  presented  which appear on their
face to be in substantial  compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit,  the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole  discretion,  either  accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further  investigation,  regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary,  or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such  documents if such  documents  are not in strict  compliance  with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

               (g)  Disbursement  Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall,  promptly
                    ------------------------
following its receipt thereof,  examine all documents  purporting to represent a
demand for payment  under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing  Bank shall  promptly
notify the  Administrative  Agent and the  Borrower by telephone  (confirmed  by
telecopy)  of such demand for  payment and whether the Issuing  Bank has made or
will make an LC  Disbursement  thereunder;  provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its  obligation to
reimburse  the  Issuing  Bank  and  the  Lenders  with  respect  to any  such LC
Disbursement.

               (h)  Interim  Interest.  If the  Issuing  Bank  shall make any LC
                    -----------------
Disbursement,  then,  until the Borrower shall have  reimbursed the Issuing Bank
for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing under Section
2.08(e)),  the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest,  for each day from and
including the date such LC  Disbursement  is made to but excluding the date that
the  Borrower  reimburses  such LC  Disbursement,  at the  rate per  annum  then
applicable to ABR Loans. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.08(h) shall
be for the account of the Issuing  Bank,  except  that  interest  accrued on and
after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(e) to reimburse
the  Issuing  Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

               (i)  Replacement  of the Issuing  Bank.  The Issuing  Bank may be
                    ---------------------------------
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent,  the  replaced   Issuing  Bank  and  the  successor   Issuing  Bank.  The
Administrative  Agent shall  notify the Lenders of any such  replacement  of the
Issuing  Bank.  At the time any such  replacement  shall become  effective,  the
Borrower  shall pay all unpaid  fees  accrued  for the  account of the  replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section  3.05(b).  From and after the effective date of
any such  replacement,  (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii)references herein to the term "Issuing
Bank"  shall be deemed to refer to such  successor  or to any  previous  Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous  Issuing Banks, as the context shall
require.  After the  replacement  of the Issuing  Bank  hereunder,  the replaced
Issuing  Bank shall  remain a party  hereto and shall  continue  to have all the
rights and  obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters  of  Credit  issued  by it prior to such  replacement,  but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

               (j) Cash  Collateralization.  If (i) any  Event of Default  shall
                   -----------------------
occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative
Agent or the Majority Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral  pursuant
to this  Section  2.08(j),  or  (ii)  the  Borrower  is  required  to pay to the

                                       32

Administrative  Agent the excess  attributable  to an LC Exposure in  connection
with any  prepayment  pursuant  to  Section  3.04(c),  then the  Borrower  shall
deposit,  in an  account  with  the  Administrative  Agent,  in the  name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal
to, in the case of an Event of Default,  the LC  Exposure,  and in the case of a
payment  required by Section  3.04(c),  the amount of such excess as provided in
Section 3.04(c),  as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest  thereon;
provided  that the  obligation  to deposit  such cash  collateral  shall  become
effective  immediately,  and  such  deposit  shall  become  immediately  due and
payable,  without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of  Default  with  respect  to the  Borrower  or any  Material  Subsidiary
described in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i). The Borrower hereby grants to
the  Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders,
an exclusive first priority and continuing  perfected  security  interest in and
Lien on such account and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments,
if any,  from time to time  deposited or held in such  account,  all deposits or
wire  transfers  made  thereto,  any and all  investments  purchased  with funds
deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial
assets and other  Property from time to time  received,  receivable or otherwise
payable in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the foregoing,  and all
proceeds, products,  accessions,  rents, profits, income and benefits therefrom,
and any substitutions and replacements  therefor.  The Borrower's  obligation to
deposit  amounts  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.08(j)  shall  be  absolute  and
unconditional,  without regard to whether any  beneficiary of any such Letter of
Credit  has  attempted  to draw down all or a portion of such  amount  under the
terms of a Letter of Credit,  and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law,  shall not be subject to any  defense or be affected by a right of set-off,
counterclaim or recoupment which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may now
or  hereafter  have  against  any  such  beneficiary,   the  Issuing  Bank,  the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason whatsoever.
Such deposit shall be held as collateral securing the payment and performance of
the  Borrower's  and the  Guarantor's  obligations  under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control,  including the exclusive right of withdrawal,  over such account. Other
than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,  which  investments
shall be made at the written  request and instruction of the Borrower but at the
option and sole  discretion of the  Administrative  Agent and at the  Borrower's
risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
any,  on such  investments  shall  accumulate  in such  account.  Moneys in such
account  shall be applied by the  Administrative  Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC  Disbursements  for  which it has not been  reimbursed  and,  to the
extent not so applied,  shall be held for the satisfaction of the  reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been  accelerated,  be applied to satisfy other  obligations of
the  Borrower  and  the  Guarantors  under  this  Agreement  or the  other  Loan
Documents.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash  collateral
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and the Borrower
is  not  otherwise  required  to  pay to the  Administrative  Agent  the  excess
attributable  to an LC Exposure in connection  with any  prepayment  pursuant to
Section 3.04(c), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
be returned  to the  Borrower  within  three  Business  Days after all Events of
Default have been cured or waived.

         Section 3.01 Repayment of Loans.  The Borrower  hereby  unconditionally
                      ------------------
promises to pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of each Lender the
then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Termination Date.

         Section 3.02 Interest.
                      --------

               (a) ABR Loans. The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
                   ---------
interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable  Margin, but in no event
to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.

               (b)  Eurodollar  Loans.  The  Loans  comprising  each  Eurodollar
                    -----------------
Borrowing  shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period
in effect for such  Borrowing  plus the  Applicable  Margin,  but in no event to
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.

               (c)  Post-Default  Rate.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if any
                    ------------------
principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other  amount  payable by the
Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid
when due,  whether at stated  maturity,  upon  acceleration  or otherwise,  such
overdue amount shall bear interest,  after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to two  percent  (2%) plus the rate  applicable  to ABR Loans as
provided in Section 3.02(a), but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.

               (d) Interest  Payment Dates.  Accrued interest on each Loan shall
                   -----------------------
be payable in arrears  on each  Interest  Payment  Date for such Loan and on the
Termination Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Section 3.02(c)
shall be payable on demand,  (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
any  Loan  (other  than an  optional  prepayment  of an ABR  Loan  prior  to the
Termination  Date),  accrued  interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or  prepayment,  and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any  Eurodollar  Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor,  accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion.

               (e) Interest Rate  Computations.  All interest hereunder shall be
                   ---------------------------
computed  on the  basis of a year of 360 days,  unless  such  computation  would
exceed the Highest  Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year),  except that  interest
computed by reference  to the  Alternate  Base Rate at times when the  Alternate
Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the
actual  number of days elapsed  (including  the first day but excluding the last
day). The applicable  Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall
be determined  by the  Administrative  Agent,  and such  determination  shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and be binding upon the parties hereto.

         Section 3.03 Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the  commencement
                      --------------------------
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

               (a) the  Administrative  Agent  determines  (which  determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not  exist for  ascertaining  the  Adjusted  LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period; or

                                       34

               (b) the  Administrative  Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders
that the  Adjusted  LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate,  as  applicable,  for such  Interest
Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making
or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative  Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by  telephone  or telecopy as promptly as  practicable  thereafter  and,
until the  Administrative  Agent  notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances  giving  rise to such  notice no longer  exist,  (i) any  Interest
Election   Request  that  requests  the  conversion  of  any  Borrowing  to,  or
continuation  of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar  Borrowing shall be ineffective,
and  (ii)  if any  Borrowing  Request  requests  a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         Section 3.04 Prepayments.
                      -----------

               (a) Optional  Prepayments.  The Borrower  shall have the right at
                   ---------------------
any time and from  time to time to  prepay  any  Borrowing  in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 3.04(b).

               (b) Notice and Terms of Optional  Prepayment.  The Borrower shall
                   ----------------------------------------
notify the  Administrative  Agent by  telephone  (confirmed  by telecopy) of any
prepayment  hereunder (i) in the case of  prepayment of a Eurodollar  Borrowing,
not later than 1:00 p.m.  Charlotte,  North Carolina  time,  three Business Days
before  the  date of  prepayment,  or (ii) in the case of  prepayment  of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m. Charlotte, North Carolina time, one Business
Day before the date of  prepayment.  Each such notice shall be  irrevocable  and
shall specify the prepayment date and the principal  amount of each Borrowing or
portion  thereof to be prepaid.  Promptly  following  receipt of any such notice
relating to a Borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents  thereof.  Each partial  prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be  permitted  in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.02.  Each  prepayment of a Borrowing shall be
applied  ratably to the Loans  included  in the prepaid  Borrowing.  Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02.

               (c) Mandatory Prepayments.
                   ---------------------

                    (i) If, after giving effect to any  termination or reduction
          of the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to Section 2.06(b), the Aggregate
          Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the Aggregate Commitments, then the
          Borrower shall 119.  prepay the  Borrowings in an aggregate  principal
          amount equal to such excess, or add to the Mortgaged Property, Oil and
          Gas  Properties,  having value,  as  determined by the  Administrative
          Agent and the Majority Lenders,  equal to or greater than such excess,
          or a  combination  thereof  and  120.  if  any  excess  remains  after
          prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure,  pay to
          the  Administrative  Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount equal to
          such  excess to be held as cash  collateral  as  provided  in  Section
          2.08(j).  The  Borrower  will be  obligated  to make such  prepayment,
          provide  such  collateral  and/or  deposit of cash  collateral  within
          ninety  (90) days  following  such  termination  or  reduction  of the
          Aggregate  Commitment;  provided that all payments required to be made

                                       35

          pursuant to this  Section  3.04(c)(i)  must be made on or prior to the
          Termination Date.

                    (ii) Upon any redetermination of or adjustment to the amount
          of the  Borrowing  Base in  accordance  with  Section  2.07 or Section
          8.13(c),  if the  Aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Exposures  exceeds the
          redetermined or adjusted  Borrowing Base, then the Borrower shall 122.
          prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate  principal  amount equal to such
          excess,  or add to the  Mortgaged  Property,  Oil and Gas  Properties,
          having  value,  as  determined  by the  Administrative  Agent  and the
          Majority  Lenders,  equal  to  or  greater  than  such  excess,  or  a
          combination thereof and 123. if any excess remains after prepaying all
          of  the  Borrowings  as a  result  of  an  LC  Exposure,  pay  to  the
          Administrative  Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount equal to such
          excess to be held as cash  collateral as provided in Section  2.08(j).
          The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment,  provide such
          collateral  and/or deposit of cash collateral  within ninety (90) days
          following its receipt of the New  Borrowing  Base Notice in accordance
          with Section 2.07(d) or the date the adjustment occurs;  provided that
          all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section  3.04(c)(ii)
          must be made on or prior to the Termination Date.

                    (iii) Upon any adjustments to the Borrowing Base pursuant to
          Section  9.12(a) or Section 9.13, if the  Aggregate  Revolving  Credit
          Exposures  exceeds the Borrowing  Base as adjusted,  then the Borrower
          shall 125.  prepay the  Borrowings  in an aggregate  principal  amount
          equal to such excess,  or add to the Mortgaged  Property,  Oil and Gas
          Properties,  having value, as determined by the  Administrative  Agent
          and the Majority  Lenders,  equal to or greater than such excess, or a
          combination thereof and 126. if any excess remains after prepaying all
          of  the  Borrowings  as a  result  of  an  LC  Exposure,  pay  to  the
          Administrative  Agent on behalf of the Lenders an amount equal to such
          excess to be held as cash  collateral as provided in Section  2.08(j).
          The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment,  provide such
          collateral  and/or deposit of cash collateral  within ninety (90) days
          following such adjustment to the Borrowing Base (or, if sooner, on the
          date the Borrower  receives cash proceeds as a result of a disposition
          pursuant to Section 9.13);  provided that all payments  required to be
          made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(iii) must be made on or prior to
          the Termination Date.

                    (iv) Each prepayment of Borrowings  pursuant to this Section
          3.04(c) shall be applied,  first,  ratably to any ABR Borrowings  then
          outstanding,   and,   second,   to  any  Eurodollar   Borrowings  then
          outstanding,  and if  more  than  one  Eurodollar  Borrowing  is  then
          outstanding,  to each such  Eurodollar  Borrowing in order of priority
          beginning with the Eurodollar  Borrowing with the least number of days
          remaining in the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto and ending with
          the Eurodollar Borrowing with the most number of days remaining in the
          Interest Period applicable thereto.

                    (v) Each  prepayment of Borrowings  pursuant to this Section
          3.04(c) shall be applied  ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid
          Borrowings.  Prepayments  pursuant to this  Section  3.04(c)  shall be
          accompanied  by accrued  interest  to the extent  required  by Section
          3.02.

                                       36

               (d) No Premium or  Penalty.  Prepayments  permitted  or  required
                   ----------------------
under this Section 3.04 shall be without premium or penalty,  except as required
under Section 5.02.

         Section 3.05 Fees.
                      ----

               (a)  Commitment   Fees.  The  Borrower   agrees  to  pay  to  the
                    -----------------
Administrative  Agent for the account of each  Lender a  commitment  fee,  which
shall accrue at the applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the daily unused amount of
the  Commitment  of such Lender during the period from and including the date of
this Agreement to but excluding the Termination  Date.  Accrued  commitment fees
shall be  payable  in  arrears  on the last day of March,  June,  September  and
December of each year and on the Termination Date,  commencing on the first such
date to occur after the date hereof.  All  commitment  fees shall be computed on
the  basis of a year of 360 days,  unless  such  computation  would  exceed  the
Highest  Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap  year),  and  shall be  payable  for the
actual  number of days elapsed  (including  the first day but excluding the last
day).

               (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower  agrees to pay (i) to the
                   ---------------------
Administrative  Agent for the  account of each Lender a  participation  fee with
respect to its  participations  in Letters of Credit,  which shall accrue at the
same  Applicable  Margin used to  determine  the  interest  rate  applicable  to
Eurodollar  Loans on the  average  daily  amount of such  Lender's  LC  Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof  attributable  to unreimbursed LC  Disbursements)
during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but excluding
the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment  terminates and the date
on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure,  (ii) to the Issuing Bank a
fronting fee,  which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average
daily amount of the LC Exposure  (excluding any portion thereof  attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements)  during the period from and including the date of
this  Agreement to but  excluding  the later of the date of  termination  of the
Commitments  and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure,  provided
that in no event shall such fee be less than $300 during any quarter,  and (iii)
to the Issuing Bank, for its own account,  its standard fees with respect to the
issuance,  amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall
be payable on the third Business Day following such last day,  commencing on the
first such date to occur  after the date of this  Agreement;  provided  that all
such fees shall be payable on the  Termination  Date and any such fees  accruing
after the Termination Date shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to
the Issuing Bank  pursuant to this Section  3.05(b)  shall be payable  within 10
days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on
the  basis of a year of 360 days,  unless  such  computation  would  exceed  the
Highest  Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap  year),  and  shall be  payable  for the
actual  number of days elapsed  (including  the first day but excluding the last
day).

               (c) Administrative  Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
                   --------------------------
Administrative  Agent,  for its own account,  fees payable in the amounts and at
the times  separately  agreed upon between the  Borrower and the  Administrative
Agent.

                        --------------------------------------------------------
Set-offs.
--------

               (a)  Payments  by the  Borrower.  The  Borrower  shall  make each
                    --------------------------
payment  required to be made by it hereunder  (whether of  principal,  interest,
fees or reimbursement of LC  Disbursements,  or of amounts payable under Section
5.01,  Section 5.02,  Section 5.03 or otherwise)  prior to 1:00 p.m.  Charlotte,
North  Carolina  time,  on the date when due, in  immediately  available  funds,
without defense,  deduction,  recoupment,  set-off or  counterclaim.  Fees, once
paid,  shall not be refundable  under any  circumstances.  Any amounts  received
after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative  Agent,
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes
of  calculating  interest  thereon.  All  such  payments  shall  be  made to the
Administrative  Agent at its offices specified in Section 12.01, except payments
to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly  provided herein and except
that payments pursuant to Section 5.01,  Section 5.02,  Section 5.03 and Section
12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative
Agent shall  distribute any such payments  received by it for the account of any
other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If
any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date
for payment shall be extended to the next  succeeding  Business Day, and, in the
case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

               (b)  Application  of  Insufficient   Payments.  If  at  any  time
                    ----------------------------------------
insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative  Agent to
pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements,  interest and
fees then due hereunder,  such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment
of interest  and fees then due  hereunder,  ratably  among the parties  entitled
thereto in  accordance  with the amounts of  interest  and fees then due to such
parties,  and (ii) second,  towards  payment of principal  and  unreimbursed  LC
Disbursements then due hereunder,  ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements  then
due to such parties.

               (c)  Sharing of  Payments by  Lenders.  If any Lender  shall,  by
                    --------------------------------
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise,  obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in
LC  Disbursements  resulting  in such  Lender  receiving  payment  of a  greater
proportion  of the  aggregate  amount  of its  Loans  and  participations  in LC
Disbursements  and accrued interest thereon than the proportion  received by any
other Lender,  then the Lender receiving such greater  proportion shall purchase
(for cash at face value)  participations  in the Loans and  participations in LC
Disbursements  of other  Lenders to the extent  necessary so that the benefit of
all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders  ratably in accordance with the
aggregate  amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans
and  participations  in  LC  Disbursements;   provided  that  (i)  if  any  such
participations  are purchased and all or any portion of the payment  giving rise
thereto is recovered,  such  participations  shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery,  without  interest,  and (ii) the
provisions  of this  Section  4.01(c)  shall  not be  construed  to apply to any
payment  made by the  Borrower  pursuant to and in  accordance  with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the  assignment  of  or  sale  of  a  participation  in  any  of  its  Loans  or

                                       38

participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof (as to which the provisions
of this Section 4.01(c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and
agrees,  to the extent it may  effectively do so under  applicable law, that any
Lender  acquiring a  participation  pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements  may
exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to
such  participation  as fully as if such  Lender  were a direct  creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

         Section  4.02  Presumption  of  Payment  by the  Borrower.  Unless  the
                        ------------------------------------------
Administrative  Agent shall have received  notice from the Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Administrative  Agent for the account of
the Lenders or the Issuing  Bank that the Borrower  will not make such  payment,
the  Administrative  Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on
such date in  accordance  herewith  and may, in reliance  upon such  assumption,
distribute  to the Lenders or the Issuing  Bank,  as the case may be, the amount
due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
of the  Lenders or the Issuing  Bank,  as the case may be,  severally  agrees to
repay to the Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed
to such  Lender or Issuing  Bank with  interest  thereon,  for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment  to the  Administrative  Agent,  at the  greater  of the  Federal  Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the  Administrative  Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

         Section 4.03 Certain  Deductions by the  Administrative  Agent.  If any
                      -------------------------------------------------
Lender  shall fail to make any  payment  required  to be made by it  pursuant to
Section  2.05(b),  Section  2.08(d),  Section  2.08(e) or Section  4.02 then the
Administrative  Agent  may,  in its  discretion  (notwithstanding  any  contrary
provision hereof),  apply any amounts thereafter  received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's  obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         Section 4.04 Disposition of Proceeds.  The Security Instruments contain
                      -----------------------
an assignment by the Borrower and/or the Material Subsidiaries unto and in favor
of the  Administrative  Agent  for  the  benefit  of the  Lenders  of all of the
Borrower's or each Material  Subsidiary's  interest in and to production and all
proceeds  attributable  thereto  which may be produced  from or allocated to the
Mortgaged Property.  The Security Instruments further provide in general for the
application of such proceeds to the  satisfaction of the  Indebtedness and other
obligations   described  therein  and  secured  thereby.   Notwithstanding   the
assignment  contained in such Security  Instruments,  until the occurrence of an
Event of Default,  (a) the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders agree that they
will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such  production nor take any
other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the  Administrative  Agent
or the Lenders,  but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to
the Borrower and its Material Subsidiarie and (b) the Lenders hereby authorize
the Administrative  Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such
proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Material Subsidiaries.

           Increased Costs; Break Funding Payments; Taxes; Illegality

         Section 5.01 Increased Costs.
                      ---------------

               (a) Eurodollar Changes in Law. If any Change in Law shall:
                   -------------------------

                    (i) impose,  modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special
          deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
          the account  of, or credit  extended  by, any Lender  (except any such
          reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

                    (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any
          other condition  affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar  Loans made by
          such Lender;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such
Lender of making or  maintaining  any  Eurodollar  Loan (or of  maintaining  its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender  (whether of principal,  interest or otherwise),  then
the Borrower will pay to such Lender such  additional  amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

               (b)  Capital  Requirements.  If any  Lender or the  Issuing  Bank
                    ---------------------
determines that any Change in Law regarding  capital  requirements  has or would
have the effect of reducing  the rate of return on such  Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's  capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company,  if any, as a  consequence  of this  Agreement or the Loans made by, or
participations  in Letters of Credit  held by,  such  Lender,  or the Letters of
Credit  issued by the Issuing  Bank,  to a level below that which such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing  Bank's  holding  company could
have  achieved  but for such  Change  in Law  (taking  into  consideration  such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time
to time the Borrower  will pay to such Lender or the Issuing  Bank,  as the case
may be, such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such
reduction suffered.

               (c)  Certificates.  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank
                    ------------
setting forth the amount or amounts  necessary to compensate  such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section
5.01(a) or (b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest  error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be,  the  amount  shown as due on any such  certificate  within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

               (d)  Effect  of  Failure  or  Delay in  Requesting  Compensation.
                    -----------------------------------------------------------
Failure  or  delay on the  part of any  Lender  or the  Issuing  Bank to  demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation.

         Section 5.02 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
                      ----------------------
any principal of any  Eurodollar  Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable  thereto  (including as a result of an Event of Default),  (b)
the  conversion of any  Eurodollar  Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last
day of the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  or (c) the failure to borrow,

                                       40

convert,  continue or prepay any  Eurodollar  Loan on the date  specified in any
notice delivered  pursuant  hereto,  then, in any such event, the Borrower shall
compensate  each  Lender for the loss,  cost and  expense  attributable  to such
event.  In the case of a  Eurodollar  Loan,  such  loss,  cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount  determined by such Lender to be the
excess,  if any, of (i) the amount of interest  which would have  accrued on the
principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred,  at the Adjusted LIBO
Rate that would have been  applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date
of such event to the last day of the then current  Interest Period therefor (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow,  convert or  continue,  for the period  that
would  have been the  Interest  Period for such  Loan),  over (ii) the amount of
interest  which  would  accrue on such  principal  amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period,  for dollar  deposits of a comparable  amount and period from other
banks in the eurodollar market.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive  pursuant to this  Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive  absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

         Section 5.03 Taxes.
                      -----

               (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account
                   ----------------------
of any  obligation  of the  Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary  under any Loan
Document  shall  be  made  free  and  clear  of and  without  deduction  for any
Indemnified  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes;  provided  that if the  Borrower  shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable  shall be  increased  as  necessary so that after making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 5.03(a)),  the Administrative  Agent,  Lender or Issuing Bank
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received
had no such  deductions  been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii)  the  Borrower  shall pay the full  amount  deducted  to the  relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

               (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the  Borrower.  The Borrower  shall
                   ---------------------------------------
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant  Governmental  Authority in accordance  with
applicable law.

               (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify
                   -------------------------------
the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after
written demand therefor,  for the full amount of any Indemnified  Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by the Administrative  Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case  may  be,  on or  with  respect  to any  payment  by or on  account  of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or  attributable  to amounts  payable  under this Section
5.03) and any penalties,  interest and reasonable  expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate  of the  Administrative  Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank as to
the  amount of such  payment  or  liability  under  this  Section  5.03 shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                                       41

               (d)  Evidence  of  Payments.  As soon as  practicable  after  any
                    ----------------------
payment of  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a  Governmental
Authority,  the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent the original
or  a  certified  copy  of a  receipt  issued  by  such  Governmental  Authority
evidencing  such payment,  a copy of the return  reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

               (e) Foreign  Lenders.  Any Foreign  Lender that is entitled to an
                   ----------------
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is located,  or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party,  with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative  Agent), at the
time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation  prescribed  by  applicable  law or  reasonably  requested  by the
Borrower as will permit such  payments to be made  without  withholding  or at a
reduced rate.

               (f)  Tax  Refunds.  If  the  Administrative  Agent  or  a  Lender+
                    ------------
determines,  in its reasonable discretion,  that it has received a refund of any
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with
respect to which the  Borrower  has paid  additional  amounts  pursuant  to this
Section  5.03,  it shall pay over such refund to the  Borrower  (but only to the
extent of indemnity  payments made, or additional  amounts paid, by the Borrower
under this  Section 5.03 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund),  net of all out-of-pocket  expenses of the Administrative Agent or
such Lender and without  interest  (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental  Authority  with  respect  to  such  refund);  provided,  that  the
Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to
repay the amount  paid over to the  Borrower  (plus any  penalties,  interest or
other  charges   imposed  by  the  relevant   Governmental   Authority)  to  the
Administrative  Agent or such  Lender in the event the  Administrative  Agent or
such Lender is required  to repay such  refund to such  Governmental  Authority.
This Section 5.03 shall not be construed to require the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information  relating
to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

         Section 5.04  Designation of Different  Lending  Office.  If any Lender
                       -----------------------------------------
requests  compensation under Section 5.01, or if the Borrower is required to pay
any  additional  amount to any  Lender  or any  Governmental  Authority  for the
account of any Lender  pursuant  to Section  5.03,  then such  Lender  shall use
reasonable  efforts to  designate  a  different  lending  office for  funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its  offices,  branches or  affiliates,  if, in the  judgment of such
Lender,  such  designation or assignment  (i) would  eliminate or reduce amounts
payable  pursuant to Section  5.01 or Section  5.03,  as the case may be, in the
future  and (ii)  would not  subject  such  Lender to any  unreimbursed  cost or
expense and would not otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

         Section 5.05  Illegality.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
                       ----------
Agreement,  in the  event  that  it  becomes  unlawful  for  any  Lender  or its
applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans either generally or having a particular  Interest Period  hereunder,  then
(a) such Lender shall promptly  notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
thereof and such  Lender's  obligation  to make such  Eurodollar  Loans shall be

                                       42

suspended (the  "Affected  Loans") until such time as such Lender may again make
                 ---------------
and  maintain  such  Eurodollar  Loans and (b)  all  Affected  Loans which would
otherwise  be made by such Lender  shall be made  instead as ABR Loans (and,  if
such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent,
all  Affected  Loans of such  Lender  then  outstanding  shall be  automatically
converted  into ABR Loans on the date  specified  by such Lender in such notice)
and, to the extent that Affected  Loans are so made as (or  converted  into) ABR
Loans,  all  payments  of  principal  which would  otherwise  be applied to such
Lender's Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans.

other  amounts due and  payable on or prior to the  Effective  Date,  including,
without limitation,  to the extent invoiced,  reimbursement or payment of all of
the Administrative Agent's out-of-pocket expenses including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent, required to be reimbursed or paid by the Borrower hereunder.

               (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of
the  Secretary  or an  Assistant  Secretary  of each of the  Borrower  and  each
Guarantor setting forth 168.  resolutions of its board of directors with respect
to the  authorization  of the Borrower or such  Guarantor to execute and deliver
the Loan  Documents  to which it is a party and to enter  into the  transactions
contemplated  in those  documents,  169.  the  officers of the  Borrower or such
Guarantor  (y) who are  authorized  to sign the  Loan  Documents  to  which  the
Borrower  or such  Guarantor  is a party and (z) who  will,  until  replaced  by
another  officer  or  officers  duly  authorized  for that  purpose,  act as its
representative  for the  purposes of signing  documents  and giving  notices and
other  communications  in connection  with this  Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated hereby, 170. specimen signatures of such authorized  officers,  and
171. the articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Borrower and
such Guarantor,  certified as being true and complete.  The Administrative Agent
and  the  Lenders  may  conclusively   rely  on  such   certificate   until  the
Administrative  Agent  receives  notice  in  writing  from the  Borrower  to the
contrary.

               (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received  certificates of
the appropriate State agencies with respect to the existence,  qualification and
good standing of the Borrower and each Guarantor.

               (d) The  Administrative  Agent shall have  received a  compliance
certificate  which  shall be  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit B, duly and
properly executed by a Responsible Officer and dated as of the date of Effective
Date.

               (e) The Administrative  Agent shall have received from each party

Instruments, the Administrative Agent shall:

                    (i) be reasonably  satisfied  that the Security  Instruments
          create first priority, perfected Liens (subject only to Excepted Liens
          identified  in clauses (a) to (d) and (f) of the  definition  thereof,
          but subject to the provisos at the end of such definition) on at least

consent,  approval,  registration,  filing  or other  action  necessary  for the
validity  or  enforceability  of any Loan  Document or the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated thereby, except such as have been obtained or made and
are in full force and effect  other than (i).  the  recording  and filing of the
Security  Instruments  as required by this Agreement and (ii). those third party
approvals or consents which, if not made or obtained,  would not cause a Default

other organizational documents of the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or any
order of any  Governmental  Authority,  (c).  will not  violate  or  result in a
default  under any  indenture,  agreement or other  instrument  binding upon the
Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary or its Properties,  or give rise to a right
thereunder  to require any payment to be made by the  Borrower or such  Material
Subsidiary and (d). will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any Property of the Borrower or any  Material  Subsidiary  (other than the Liens

                      -----------------------------------------------

present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its  Consolidated  Subsidiaries as
of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP,  subject to year-end
audit  adjustments  and the absence of  footnotes  in the case of the  unaudited
quarterly financial statements.

               (b) Since  December  31,  2001,  (i)  there has  been no material
adverse  change in the  business,  assets,  operations,  prospects or condition,

fully covered by insurance (except for normal  deductibles) as to which there is
a  reasonable  possibility  of  an  adverse  determination  that,  if  adversely
determined,  could reasonably be expected,  individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material  Adverse Effect,  or 218. that involve any Loan Document or
the Transactions.

               (b) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in
the status of the matters  disclosed in Schedule 7.05 that,  individually  or in
the  aggregate,  has resulted in, or materially  increased the  likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 7.06 Environmental  Matters.  Except as could not be reasonably
                      ----------------------
expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect (or with respect to (c), (d) and (e)
below,  where the failure to take such actions could not be reasonably  expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect):

               (a)  neither  any  Property  of  the  Borrower  or  any  Material
Subsidiary nor the operations conducted thereon violate any order or requirement
of any court or Governmental Authority or any Environmental Laws.

               (b) no Property of the  Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary  nor
the operations currently conducted thereon or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
by any prior owner or operator of such Property or  operation,  are in violation

investigation,  inquiry or  proceeding  by or before  any court or  Governmental
Authority or to any remedial obligations under Environmental Laws.

               (c) all  notices,  permits,  licenses,  exemptions,  approvals or
similar  authorizations,  if any, required to be obtained or filed in connection
with the  operation  or use of any and all  Property  of the  Borrower  and each
Material Subsidiary,  including,  without limitation, past or present treatment,
storage,  disposal  or release of a  hazardous  substance,  oil and gas waste or
solid waste into the  environment,  have been duly  obtained  or filed,  and the
Borrower  and each  Material  Subsidiary  are in  compliance  with the terms and
conditions of all such notices, permits, licenses and similar authorizations.

               (d) all hazardous substances,  solid waste and oil and gas waste,

substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment, and, to
the knowledge of the  Borrower,  all such  transport  carriers and treatment and
disposal facilities have been and are operating in compliance with Environmental
Laws and so as not to pose an imminent and  substantial  endangerment  to public
health or welfare or the  environment,  and are not the subject of any existing,
pending or  threatened  action,  investigation  or  inquiry by any  Governmental
Authority in connection with any Environmental Laws.

each  Material  Subsidiary  currently  satisfies  all  design,   operation,  and
equipment  requirements  imposed by the OPA, and the Borrower  does not have any
reason to believe that such Property, to the extent subject to the OPA, will not
be able to maintain compliance with the OPA requirements during the term of this
Agreement.

               (g) neither the  Borrower  nor any  Material  Subsidiary  has any
known  contingent  liability or Remedial Work in connection  with any release or
threatened release of any oil, hazardous  substance,  solid waste or oil and gas

compliance with all Governmental  Requirements  applicable to it or its Property
and all agreements and other  instruments  binding upon it or its Property,  and
possesses all licenses,  permits,  franchises,  exemptions,  approvals and other
governmental  authorizations necessary for the ownership of its Property and the

Effect.

               (b)  Neither  the  Borrower  nor any  Material  Subsidiary  is in
default nor has any event or circumstance occurred which, but for the expiration
of any  applicable  grace  period  or the  giving  of  notice,  or  both,  would
constitute a default or would  require the Borrower or a Material  Subsidiary to
Redeem or make any offer to do any of the foregoing  under any indenture,  note,
credit  agreement or instrument  pursuant to which any Material  Indebtedness is
outstanding or by which the Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary or any of their
Properties is bound.

               (c) No Default has occurred and is continuing.

         Section  7.08  Investment  Company  Act.  Neither the  Borrower nor any
                        ------------------------

judgment,  writ or decree,  which  either  restricts or purports to restrict its
ability  to grant  Liens to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders on or in
respect of their Properties to secure the Indebtedness and the Loan Documents.

         Section 7.15  Subsidiaries.  Except as set forth on Schedule 7.15 or as
                       ------------
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly furnish a
copy to the Lenders), which shall be a supplement to Schedule 7.15, the Borrower

                                       51

has no Subsidiaries. Schedule 7.15 identifies each Subsidiary that is a Material
Subsidiary,  and each Material  Subsidiary  on such  schedule is a  Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary.

         Section  7.16  Location  of  Business  and  Offices.   The   Borrower's
                        ------------------------------------
jurisdiction of organization is Delaware;  the name of the Borrower as listed in
the public records of its  jurisdiction  of  organization is St. Mary Land &amp;
Exploration  Company;  and  the  organizational  identification  number  of  the
Borrower in its jurisdiction of organization is 44728. The Borrower's  principal
place of  business  and chief  executive  offices  are  located  at the  address
specified in Section  12.01 (or as set forth in a notice  delivered  pursuant to
Section 8.01(m) and Section 12.01(c)).  Each Material Subsidiary's  jurisdiction
of  organization,  name as listed in the public records of its  jurisdiction  of
organization,  organizational  identification  number  in  its  jurisdiction  of
organization,  and the  location of its  principal  place of business  and chief
executive  office  is  stated  on  Schedule  7.15  (or as set  forth in a notice
delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(m)).

         Section 7.17  Properties;  Titles,  Etc. Except for matters which could
                       -------------------------
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

               (a) Each of the Borrower and the Material  Subsidiaries  has good
and  defensible  title  to the Oil  and Gas  Properties  evaluated  in the  most
recently delivered Reserve Report and good title to all its personal Properties,
in each case,  free and clear of all Liens  except  Liens  permitted  by Section
9.03.  After  giving  full effect to the  Excepted  Liens,  the  Borrower or the
Material Subsidiary  specified as the owner owns the net interests in production
attributable  to the  Hydrocarbon  Interests as  reflected in the most  recently
delivered Reserve Report,  and the ownership of such Properties shall not in any
material respect  obligate the Borrower or such Material  Subsidiary to bear the
costs and expenses  relating to the  maintenance,  development and operations of
each such  Property  in an amount in  excess  of the  working  interest  of each
Property set forth in the most  recently  delivered  Reserve  Report that is not
offset by a  corresponding  proportionate  increase  in the  Borrower's  or such
Material Subsidiary's net revenue interest in such Property.

               (b) All material leases and agreements  necessary for the conduct
of the  business of the Borrower  and the  Material  Subsidiaries  are valid and
subsisting,  in full force and effect,  and there  exists no default or event or
circumstance  which  with the  giving of notice or the  passage  of time or both
would give rise to a default under any such lease or leases,  which would affect
in any  material  respect the conduct of the  business of the  Borrower  and the
Material Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

               (c) The rights and Properties presently owned, leased or licensed
by the Borrower and the Material Subsidiaries including, without limitation, all
easements  and rights of way,  include all rights and  Properties  necessary  to
permit the Borrower and the Material  Subsidiaries  to conduct their business in
all  material  respects in the same manner as its  business  has been  conducted
prior to the date hereof.

                                       52

               (d)  All of the  Properties  of the  Borrower  and  the  Material
Subsidiaries  which  are  reasonably   necessary  for  the  operation  of  their
businesses are in good working  condition and are maintained in accordance  with
prudent business standards.

               (e)  The  Borrower  and  each  Material  Subsidiary  owns,  or is
licensed  to use,  all  trademarks,  tradenames,  copyrights,  patents and other
intellectual  Property  material  to its  business,  and the use  thereof by the
Borrower and such Material  Subsidiary  does not infringe upon the rights of any
other Person,  except for any such  infringements  that,  individually or in the
aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be expected  to result in a Material  Adverse
Effect.  The  Borrower and its  Material  Subsidiaries  either own or have valid
licenses or other  rights to use all  databases,  geological  data,  geophysical
data, engineering data, seismic data, maps,  interpretations and other technical
information  used in their  businesses  as presently  conducted,  subject to the
limitations  contained in the  agreements  governing the use of the same,  which
limitations  are  customary  for  companies  engaged  in  the  business  of  the
exploration  and production of  Hydrocarbons,  with such exceptions as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section  7.18  Maintenance  of  Properties.  Except  for  such  acts or
                        ---------------------------
failures to act as could not be reasonably  expected to have a Material  Adverse
Effect, the Oil and Gas Properties (and Properties unitized therewith) have been
maintained,  operated  and  developed  in a good and  workmanlike  manner and in
conformity  with  all  Government   Requirements  and  in  conformity  with  the
provisions of all leases,  subleases or other contracts comprising a part of the
Hydrocarbon  Interests and other contracts and agreements  forming a part of the
Oil and Gas Properties.  Specifically  in connection with the foregoing,  except
for those as could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
(i) no Oil and Gas  Property is subject to having allowable  production  reduced
below  the  full  and  regular  allowable  (including  the  maximum  permissible
tolerance)  because  of  any  overproduction   (whether  or  not  the  same  was
permissible at the time) and (ii) none of the wells comprising a part of the Oil
and Gas  Properties  (or  Properties  unitized  therewith)  is deviated from the
vertical more than the maximum  permitted by Government  Requirements,  and such
wells are, in fact,  bottomed  under and are producing  from, and the well bores
are wholly  within,  the Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells located
on Properties  unitized  therewith,  such unitized  Properties).  All pipelines,
wells,  gas  processing  plants,  platforms  and  other  material  improvements,
fixtures and  equipment  owned in whole or in part by the Borrower or any of its
Material  Subsidiaries that are necessary to conduct normal operations are being
maintained in a state adequate to conduct normal operations, and with respect to
such of the foregoing  which are operated by the Borrower or any of its Material
Subsidiaries,  in a  manner  consistent  with  the  Borrower's  or its  Material
Subsidiaries'  past practices (other than those the failure of which to maintain
in  accordance  with this Section 7.07 could not  reasonably be expect to have a
Material Adverse Effect).

         Section 7.19 Gas Imbalances, Prepayments. As of the date hereof, except
                      ---------------------------
as set  forth on  Schedule  7.19 or on the  most  recent  certificate  delivered
pursuant to Section 8.12(c), on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or
pay or other prepayments which would require the Borrower or any of its Material
Subsidiaries to deliver Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties at
some future time  without then or  thereafter  receiving  full payment  therefor
exceeding one and one-half  million mcf of gas (on an mcf  equivalent  basis) in
the aggregate.

                                       53

         Section 7.20 Marketing of Production.  Except for contracts  listed and
                      -----------------------
in effect on the date hereof on Schedule 7.20, and thereafter  either  disclosed
in  writing  to the  Administrative  Agent  or  included  in the  most  recently
delivered  Reserve  Report (with respect to all of which  contracts the Borrower
represents  that it or its Material  Subsidiaries  are receiving a price for all
production sold thereunder  which is computed  substantially  in accordance with
the terms of the  relevant  contract  and are not  having  deliveries  curtailed
substantially  below the  subject  Property's  delivery  capacity),  no material
agreements  exist which are not  cancelable  on 60 days  notice or less  without
penalty or  detriment  for the sale of  production  from the  Borrower's  or its
Material Subsidiaries' Hydrocarbons (including,  without limitation, calls on or
other  rights to  purchase,  production,  whether or not the same are  currently
being  exercised)  that (a)  pertain to  the sale of production at a fixed price
and (b)  have a maturity  or expiry  date of longer than six (6) months from the
date hereof.

         Section 7.21 Swap Agreements. Schedule 7.21, as of the date hereof, and
                      ---------------
after the date  hereof,  each report  required to be  delivered  by the Borrower
pursuant to Section  8.01(d),  sets forth,  a true and complete list of all Swap
Agreements  of the Borrower and each  Material  Subsidiary,  the material  terms
thereof (including the type, term, effective date, termination date and notional
amounts or volumes),  the net mark to market value  thereof,  all credit support
agreements  relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied) and the
counterparty to each such agreement.

         Section  7.22 Use of Loans and Letters of Credit.  The  proceeds of the
                       ----------------------------------
Loans and the Letters of Credit shall be used (a) to provide working capital for
exploration,  development  and  production  operations,  (b)  to  refinance  the
acquisition of Oil &amp; Gas  Properties,  (c) to renew,  rearrange,  modify and
extend the Debt under the Existing  Credit  Agreement  assigned  pursuant to the
Assignments,  (d) to fund the  $72,000,000  loan evidenced by the "Note" defined
and  described  in  Section  7.03  of the  Purchase  and  Sale  Agreement  (said
$72,000,000  principal  amount  being  subject to  adjustment  [higher or lower]
pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale  Agreement),  and (d) for general
corporate   purposes.   The  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  are  not  engaged
principally,  or as one of its or their important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate,  incidental or ultimate, of
buying or carrying  margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U or X of the
Board). No part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used for
any purpose which violates the provisions of Regulations U or X of the Board.

         Section  7.23  Solvency.   After  giving  effect  to  the  transactions
                        --------
contemplated  hereby,  (a) the aggregate  assets (after giving effect to amounts
that could reasonably be received by reason of indemnity,  offset,  insurance or
any  similar  arrangement),  at a  fair  valuation,  of  the  Borrower  and  the
Guarantors, taken as a whole, will exceed the aggregate Debt of the Borrower and
the  Guarantors  on a  consolidated  basis,  as the Debt  becomes  absolute  and
matures,  (b) each of the Borrower and the Guarantors  will not have incurred or
intended  to incur,  and will not believe  that it will  incur,  Debt beyond its
ability to pay such Debt (after  taking  into  account the timing and amounts of
cash to be received by each of the Borrower and the  Guarantors  and the amounts
to be payable on or in respect of its liabilities,  and giving effect to amounts
that could reasonably be received by reason of indemnity,  offset,  insurance or
any similar arrangement) as such Debt becomes  absolute and matures and (c) each
of the  Borrower  and the  Guarantors  will not have (and will have no reason to

                                       54

believe that it will have thereafter) unreasonably small capital for the conduct
of its business.

         Section 7.24 Material Agreements.  The Borrower has delivered or caused
                      -------------------
to be  delivered  to the  Administrative  Agent true and  correct  copies of the
Material Agreements. The Material Agreements have not been modified, terminated,
assigned or pledged by Borrower or any Material Subsidiary,  as applicable,  are
in full force and effect  and no party is in default in the  performance  of its
obligations thereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

Subsidiaries'  Properties  or any other  Property  to the  extent  caused by the

Subsidiaries' Properties,  which failure to commence and diligently prosecute to
completion could  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;  and
(v) establish and  implement,  and shall cause each  Subsidiary to establish and
implement,  such  procedures as may be necessary to  continuously  determine and
assure that the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries'  obligations under this Section

and the Lenders in writing of any threatened action, investigation or inquiry by

               (c) In  connection  with any future  acquisitions  of Oil and Gas

         Section 8.11 Further Assurances.
                      ------------------

               (a) The  Borrower  at its  expense  will,  and  will  cause  each
Material Subsidiary to, promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
all such other documents, agreements and instruments reasonably requested by the
Administrative  Agent  to  comply  with,  cure any  defects  or  accomplish  the
conditions  precedent,  covenants and agreements of the Borrower or any Material

to further evidence and more fully describe the collateral  intended as security
for the  Indebtedness,  or to correct any  omissions  in this  Agreement  or the
Security Instruments, or to state more fully the obligations secured therein, or

                                       60

         Section 8.12 Reserve Reports.
                      ---------------

               (a) On or before  February 28th (or February 29th, as applicable)
and July 31st of each year,  commencing  February 28, 2003,  the Borrower  shall
furnish  to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders a  Reserve  Report.  The
Reserve  Report as of  December 31 of each year shall be prepared by one or more
Approved Petroleum Engineers,  and the June 30 Reserve Report of each year shall

of the  Borrower who shall  certify such Reserve  Report to be true and accurate
and to  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  used in the
immediately preceding December 31 Reserve Report.

               (b) In the  event of an  Interim  Redetermination,  the  Borrower
shall  furnish  to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders a Reserve  Report
prepared by or under the supervision of the Manager of Reservoir  Engineering of
the Borrower who shall  certify such Reserve  Report to be true and accurate and
to have been prepared in accordance  with the procedures used in the immediately
preceding December 31 Reserve Report. For any Interim Redetermination  requested
by the  Administrative  Agent or the Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.07(b),  the
Borrower  shall provide such Reserve  Report with an "as of" date as required by
the  Administrative  Agent as soon as  possible,  but in any event no later than
thirty (30) days following the receipt of such request.

               (c) With the delivery of each Reserve Report,  the Borrower shall
provide  to the  Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  a  certificate  from a
Responsible   Officer  certifying  that  in  all  material  respects:   (i)  the

exhibit to the certificate,  on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or
pay or other  prepayments in excess of the volume specified in Section 7.19 with
respect to its Oil and Gas  Properties  evaluated in such  Reserve  Report which
would require the Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary  to deliver  Hydrocarbons
either  generally or produced  from such Oil and Gas  Properties  at some future

                                       61

time without then or thereafter  receiving full payment  therefor,  (iv) none of
their Oil and Gas Properties have been sold since the date of the last Borrowing
Base determination  except as set forth on an exhibit to the certificate,  which
certificate shall list all of its Oil and Gas Properties sold and in such detail
as  reasonably  required  by the  Administrative  Agent,  (v)  attached  to  the
certificate is a list of all marketing agreements entered into subsequent to the
later of the date hereof or the most recently delivered Reserve Report which the
Borrower could reasonably be expected to have been obligated to list on Schedule
7.20 had such agreement  been in effect on the date hereof and attached  thereto
is a schedule of the Oil and Gas  Properties  evaluated by such  Reserve  Report
that are Mortgaged  Properties and demonstrating the percentage of the Borrowing
Base that the value of such Mortgaged Properties represent.

         Section 8.13 Title Information.
                      -----------------

               (a) On or before the delivery to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders of each Reserve Report  required by Section  8.12(a),  the Borrower will
deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative
Agent covering  enough of the Oil and Gas  Properties  evaluated by such Reserve
Report that were not included in the immediately  preceding  Reserve Report,  so
that  the   Administrative   Agent  shall  have  received  together  with  title
information previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, satisfactory title
information  on at least  75% of the total  value of the Oil and Gas  Properties
evaluated by such Reserve Report.

               (b) If the Borrower has provided title information for additional
Properties under Section 8.13(a),  the Borrower shall,  within 60 days of notice
from the  Administrative  Agent that  title  defects  or  exceptions  exist with
respect to such additional  Properties,  either (i) cure any such  title defects
or exceptions  (including  defects or  exceptions as to priority)  which are not
permitted by Section 9.03 raised by such information, (ii) substitute acceptable
Mortgaged  Properties  with no title defects or  exceptions  except for Excepted
Liens (other than Excepted  Liens  described in clauses (e), (g) and (h) of such
definition) having an equivalent value or (iii)deliver title information in form
and substance  acceptable to the Administrative Agent so that the Administrative
Agent shall have received,  together with title information previously delivered
to the Administrative  Agent,  satisfactory title information on at least 75% of
the value of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report.

               (c) If the Borrower is unable to cure any title defect  requested
by the Administrative  Agent or the Lenders to be cured within the 60-day period
or the  Borrower  does not comply with the  requirements  to provide  acceptable
title  information  covering  75% of the  value  of the Oil  and Gas  Properties
evaluated  in the most  recent  Reserve  Report,  such  default  shall  not be a
Default,  but instead the Administrative Agent and/or the Majority Lenders shall
have the right to exercise the following  remedy in their sole  discretion  from
time to time,  and any failure to so exercise  this remedy at any time shall not
be a waiver as to future exercise of the remedy by the  Administrative  Agent or
the Lenders. To the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders
are not satisfied  with title to any Mortgaged  Property after the 60-day period
has elapsed,  such unacceptable  Mortgaged  Property shall not count towards the
75% requirement,  and the Administrative Agent may send a notice to the Borrower
and the Lenders that the then outstanding  Borrowing Base shall be reduced by an
amount as  determined  by the  Majority  Lenders to cause the  Borrower to be in

                                       62

compliance with the requirement to provide  acceptable title  information on 75%
of the value of the Oil and Gas Properties. This new Borrowing Base shall become
effective immediately after receipt of such notice.

         Section 8.14 Additional Collateral; Additional Guarantors.
                      --------------------------------------------

               (a) In  connection  with each  redetermination  of the  Borrowing
Base,  the  Borrower  shall  review the  Reserve  Report and the list of current
Mortgaged  Properties (as described in Section 8.12(c)(vi)) to ascertain whether
the  Mortgaged  Properties  represent at least 75% of the total value of the Oil
and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently completed Reserve Report after
giving  effect  to   exploration   and  production   activities,   acquisitions,
dispositions and production.  In the event that the Mortgaged  Properties do not
represent at least 75% of such total value,  then the Borrower shall,  and shall
cause  its  Material  Subsidiaries  to,  grant  to the  Administrative  Agent as
security for the  Indebtedness a first-priority  Lien interest  (subject only to
Excepted  Liens  of the  type  described  in  clauses  (a) to (d) and (f) of the
definition  thereof,  but subject to the provisos at the end of such definition)
on  additional  Oil and Gas  Properties  not  already  subject  to a Lien of the
Security  Instruments  such that after  giving  effect  thereto,  the  Mortgaged
Properties will represent at least 75% of such total value.  All such Liens will
be created and  perfected by and in accordance  with the  provisions of deeds of
trust,   security   agreements  and  financing   statements  or  other  Security
Instruments,   all  in  form  and  substance  reasonably   satisfactory  to  the
Administrative   Agent  and  in  sufficient  executed  (and  acknowledged  where
necessary or  appropriate)  counterparts  for  recording  purposes.  In order to
comply with the foregoing,  if any Material  Subsidiary places a Lien on its Oil
and Gas  Properties  and such Material  Subsidiary  is not a Guarantor,  then it
shall become a Guarantor and comply with Section 8.14(b).

               (b)  In  the  event  that  any  Subsidiary   becomes  a  Material
Subsidiary  after the Closing  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  cause such
Subsidiary to guarantee the Indebtedness pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement.  In
connection  with any such  guaranty,  the  Borrower  shall,  or shall cause such
Subsidiary to, (A)  execute  and deliver a supplement to the Guaranty  Agreement
executed by such Subsidiary, (B) pledge  all of the Equity Interests of such new
Subsidiary   (including,   without   limitation,   delivery  of  original  stock
certificates  evidencing the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary,  together with
an appropriate  undated stock powers for each certificate duly executed in blank
by the  registered  owner  thereof)  and (C)  execute  and  deliver  such  other
additional  closing   documents,   certificates  and  legal  opinions  as  shall
reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent.

                      -----------------
will cause the  Subsidiaries  and any ERISA Affiliate to promptly furnish to the
Administrative  Agent (i)  promptly  after the filing  thereof  with the United
States Secretary of Labor,  the Internal Revenue Service or the PBGC,  copies of
each  annual and other  report  with  respect to each Plan or any trust  created
thereunder,  (ii) immediately upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any ERISA
Event or of any "prohibited  transaction,"  as described in section 406 of ERISA
or in section 4975 of the Code, in connection with any Plan or any trust created
thereunder,  a written notice signed by the President or the principal Financial
Officer,  the Subsidiary or the ERISA Affiliate,  as the case may be, specifying
the nature  thereof,  what  action the  Borrower,  the  Subsidiary  or the ERISA
Affiliate is taking or proposes to take with respect  thereto,  and, when known,

                                       63

any action taken or proposed by the Internal Revenue Service,  the Department of
Labor or the PBGC  with  respect  thereto,  and (iii) immediately  upon  receipt
thereof,  copies of any notice of the PBGC's intention to terminate or to have a
trustee  appointed to administer any Plan. With respect to each Plan (other than
a  Multiemployer  Plan),  the Borrower will, and will cause each  Subsidiary and
ERISA Affiliate to, (i)satisfy in full and in a timely manner, without incurring
any late payment or  underpayment  charge or penalty and without  giving rise to
any lien, all of the contribution and funding requirements of section 412 of the
Code  (determined  without regard to subsections  (d), (e), (f) and (k) thereof)
and of section 302 of ERISA (determined  without regard to sections 303, 304 and
306 of ERISA), and (ii)pay, or cause to be paid, to the PBGC in a timely manner,
without  incurring  any late  payment or  underpayment  charge or  penalty,  all
premiums required pursuant to sections 4006 and 4007 of ERISA.

         Section 8.16  Performance  of Material  Agreements.  The Borrower  will
                       ------------------------------------
perform and observe,  and cause each Material Subsidiary to perform and observe,
in all material  respects each of the  provisions of the Material  Agreements to
which  it is a party  on its  part to be  performed  or  observed  prior  to the
termination thereof.

liable for the failure to disclose,  any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries  that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving
as  Administrative  Agent  or  any  of  its  Affiliates  in  any  capacity.  The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written  notice  thereof is given to the  Administrative  Agent by the
Borrower  or a  Lender,  and shall  not be  responsible  for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,  warranty or representation made in

         Section 11.03 Action by Administrative  Agent. The Administrative Agent
                       -------------------------------
shall  not have  any  duty to take any  discretionary  action  or  exercise  any
discretionary   powers,   except   discretionary  rights  and  powers  expressly
contemplated  hereby  that the  Administrative  Agent is required to exercise in

                                       75

writing as directed by the Majority  Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the  Lenders as shall be  necessary  under the  circumstances  as provided in
Section  12.02)  and in all  cases  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  fully
justified  in  failing  or  refusing  to act  hereunder  or under any other Loan
Documents  unless it shall (a) receive  written  instructions  from the Majority
Lenders or the Lenders,  as  applicable,  (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
12.02)  specifying  the  action  to be  taken  and  (b)  be  indemnified  to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
instructions  as  aforesaid  and any action  taken or  failure  to act  pursuant
thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If a
Default has occurred and is continuing, then the Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such  Default as shall be directed by the  requisite
Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described in this Section
11.03,  provided  that,  unless and until the  Administrative  Agent  shall have
received  such  directions,  the  Administrative  Agent  may (but  shall  not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
In no event,  however,  shall the  Administrative  Agent be required to take any
action which exposes the Administrative  Agent to personal liability or which is
contrary  to  this  Agreement,   the  Loan  Documents  or  applicable  law.  The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the  consent or at the request of the  Majority  Lenders or the Lenders (or
such other number or percentage  of the Lenders as shall be necessary  under the
circumstances  as provided in Section 12.02),  and otherwise shall not be liable
for any  action  taken or not taken by it  hereunder  or under  any  other  Loan
Document or under any other  document or instrument  referred to or provided for
herein or therein or in  connection  herewith  or  therewith  INCLUDING  ITS OWN
ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,  consent, statement, instrument,

or sent by the proper Person.  The  Administrative  Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and each of
the  Borrower,  the  Lenders and the  Issuing  Bank  hereby  waives the right to
dispute the Administrative Agent's record of such statement,  except in the case
of gross  negligence or willful  misconduct  by the  Administrative  Agent.  The
Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower),  independent  accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any  action  taken or not taken by it in  accordance  with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may
deem and treat  the payee of any Note as the  holder  thereof  for all  purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the  assignment or transfer  thereof
permitted hereunder shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.

         Section 11.05 Subagents.  The Administrative  Agent may perform any and
                       ---------
all its duties and  exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more

any such  sub-agent  may perform any and all its duties and  exercise its rights
and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory  provisions

by  notifying  the  Lenders,  the  Issuing  Bank  and  the  Borrower,   and  the
Administrative  Agent may be removed  at any time with or  without  cause by the
Majority  Lenders.  Upon any such  resignation or removal,  the Majority Lenders
shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.
If no successor  shall have been so appointed by the Majority  Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring  Administrative
Agent gives notice of its resignation or removal of the retiring  Administrative
Agent, then the retiring  Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and
the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank
with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative  Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor  shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring
Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations
hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor  unless  otherwise  agreed
between  the  Borrower  and such  successor.  After the  Administrative  Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this ARTICLE XI and Section 12.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring  Administrative  Agent,  its
sub-agents and their respective  Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or  omitted  to be taken by any of them  while it was  acting as  Administrative
Agent.

capacity as a Lender as any other  Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not  Administrative  Agent,  and such bank and its  Affiliates  may  accept
deposits from,  lend money to and generally  engage in any kind of business with
the  Borrower or any  Subsidiary  or other  Affiliate  thereof as if it were not
Administrative Agent hereunder.

         Section  11.08  No  Reliance.  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that it has,
                         ------------
independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit  analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each
other Loan Document to which it is a party.  Each Lender also  acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such  documents and  information as it shall from time
to time deem  appropriate,  continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement,  any other Loan Document,  any
related  agreement  or any  document  furnished  hereunder  or  thereunder.  The
Administrative  Agent shall not be  required  to keep itself  informed as to the
performance  or  observance by the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of this
Agreement,  the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for
herein  or  to  inspect  the   Properties  or  books  of  the  Borrower  or  its

expressly  required to be furnished to the Lenders by the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder  or  Arranger  shall have any duty or  responsibility  to provide  any

                                       77

Lender with any credit or other  information  concerning the affairs,  financial
condition or business of the Borrower (or any of its Affiliates)  which may come
into the possession of the  Administrative  Agent or any of its  Affiliates.  In
this regard,  each Lender acknowledges that Vinson &amp; Elkins L.L.P. is acting
in this transaction as special counsel to the Administrative  Agent only, except
to the  extent  otherwise  expressly  stated  in any legal  opinion  or any Loan

         Section 12.02 Waivers; Amendments.
                       -------------------

               (a) No  failure  on the  part of the  Administrative  Agent,  the
Issuing Bank or any Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course
of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege,  under any of
the Loan Documents  shall operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or
partial  exercise  of any  right,  power  or  privilege  under  any of the  Loan
Documents  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right,  power or privilege.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative
Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank and the  Lenders  hereunder  and under the other Loan
Documents  are  cumulative  and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that
they would  otherwise  have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower  therefrom shall
in any  event be  effective  unless  the  same  shall be  permitted  by  Section
12.02(b),  and then  such  waiver  or  consent  shall be  effective  only in the
specific  instance  and for the purpose for which  given.  Without  limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  the making of a Loan or  issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default,  regardless of whether
the Administrative  Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.

               (b)  Neither  this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof nor any
Security Instrument nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified
except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements  in writing  entered into by the
Borrower  and the Majority  Lenders or by the  Borrower  and the  Administrative
Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders;  provided that no such agreement
shall (i)  increase the  Commitment  or the Maximum  Credit Amount of any Lender
without the written  consent of such Lender, (ii) increase the Borrowing Base or
modify  Section  2.07, without the written  consent of all of the Lenders, (iii)
reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest  thereon,  or reduce any fees  payable  hereunder,  or reduce any other
Indebtedness  hereunder  or under any other Loan  Document,  without the written
consent of each Lender  affected  thereby,  (iv) postpone the scheduled  date of
payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement,  or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder,  or any other Indebtedness  hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
payment,  or postpone or extend the Termination Date without the written consent
of each Lender affected  thereby,  (v) change Section 4.01(b) or Section 4.01(c)
in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments  required thereby,
without the written  consent of each Lender,  (vi) change the  definition of the
term  "Material  Subsidiary",  without the written consent of each Lender, (vii)
release any Guarantor (except as set forth in the Guaranty  Agreement),  release

                                       79

all or substantially  all of the collateral,  or reduce the percentage set forth
in Section 8.14 to less than 75%, without the written consent of each Lender, or
(viii)change any of the provisions of this Section 12.02(b) or the definition of
"Majority  Lenders"  or any other  provision  hereof  specifying  the  number or
percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or
under any other Loan  Documents or make any  determination  or grant any consent
hereunder  or any other Loan  Documents,  without  the  written  consent of each
Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect  the rights or duties of the  Administrative  Agent or the  Issuing  Bank
hereunder or under any other Loan Document  without the prior written consent of
the   Administrative   Agent  or  the  Issuing   Bank,   as  the  case  may  be.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any supplement to Schedule 7.15  (Subsidiaries)
shall  be  effective  simply  by  delivering  to  the  Administrative   Agent  a
supplemental   schedule   clearly   marked  as  such  and,  upon  receipt,   the

          additional conditions:

                         (A)  except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining  amount of the
assigning  Lender's  Commitment,  the amount of the  Commitment of the assigning
Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment
and   Assumption   with  respect  to  such   assignment   is  delivered  to  the
Administrative  Agent)  shall not be less  than  $5,000,000  unless  each of the
Borrower and the Administrative  Agent otherwise consent,  provided that no such
consent of the  Borrower  shall be required if an Event of Default has  occurred
and is continuing;

                         (B)  each  partial  assignment  shall  be  made  as  an

                         (E) in  the  case  of  an  assignment  to  a  CLO,  the
assigning  Lender  shall  retain  the  sole  right  to  approve  any  amendment,
modification  or waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement,  provided that the
Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide that such
Lender  will  not,  without  the  consent  of such CLO, agree  to any amendment,
modification  or waiver described in the first proviso  to  Section  12.02  that

                                       83

                    (iii) Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and
          recording thereof, from and after the effective date specified in each
          Assignment  and Assumption  the assignee  thereunder  shall be a party
          hereto and, to the extent of the interest  assigned by such Assignment
          and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
          Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
          the interest  assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,  be released
          from its  obligations  under this  Agreement  (and,  in the case of an
          Assignment  and  Assumption  covering  all of the  assigning  Lender's
          rights and obligations  under this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease
          to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits
          of Section 5.01,  Section 5.02,  Section 5.03 and Section 12.03).  Any
          assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
          Agreement  that does not  comply  with  this  Section  12.04  shall be
          treated for  purposes of this  Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
          participation  in such  rights  and  obligations  in  accordance  with
          Section 12.04(c).

                    (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
          agent of the Borrower,  shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of
          each Assignment and Assumption  delivered to it and a register for the
          recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Maximum
          Credit  Amount  of,  and   principal   amount  of  the  Loans  and  LC
          Disbursements  owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
          time to time (the  "Register").  The entries in the Register  shall be
                              --------
          conclusive,  and the Borrower,  the Administrative  Agent, the Issuing
          Bank and the Lenders  may treat each Person  whose name is recorded in
          the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender  hereunder  for
          all  purposes  of  this  Agreement,   notwithstanding  notice  to  the
          contrary.  The  Register  shall be  available  for  inspection  by the
          Borrower,  the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
          from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In connection with any
          changes to the Register,  if necessary,  the Administrative Agent will
          reflect the  revisions  on Annex I and forward a copy of such  revised
          Annex I to the  Borrower,  the Issuing Bank and each Lender.  (v) Upon
          its receipt of a duly completed  Assignment and Assumption executed by
          an  assigning  Lender  and  an  assignee,   the  assignee's  completed
          Administrative  Questionnaire  (unless the assignee shall already be a
          Lender  hereunder),  the processing and recordation fee referred to in
          Section  12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment  required
          by Section  12.04(b),  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  accept  such
          Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein
          in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
          Agreement  unless it has been  recorded in the Register as provided in
          this Section 12.04(b).

               (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,  the
Administrative  Agent or the Issuing Bank,  sell  participations  to one or more
banks or other entities (a  "Participant")  in all or a portion of such Lender's
                             -----------
rights and obligations  under this Agreement  (including all or a portion of its
Commitment  and the  Loans  owing  to  it);  provided  that  (A)  such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain  unchanged,  (B) such Lender shall
remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto for the  performance of
such  obligations and (C) the Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the other Lenders shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in  connection  with such  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under this
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument  pursuant to which a Lender sells such a

                                       84

participation  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall  retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,  modification  or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement;  provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any  amendment,  modification  or waiver  described in the proviso to Section
12.02 that affects such  Participant.  In addition such  agreement  must provide
that the  Participant be bound by the  provisions of Section  12.03.  Subject to
Section  12.04(c)(ii),  the  Borrower  agrees  that  each  Participant  shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section  5.01,  Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired  its interest by  assignment
pursuant to Section  12.04(b).  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be  entitled  to the  benefits  of Section  12.08 as though it were a
Lender,  provided such  Participant  agrees to be subject to Section  4.01(c) as
though it were a Lender.

                    (ii) A  Participant  shall not be  entitled  to receive  any
          greater payment under Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 than the applicable
          Lender  would  have been  entitled  to  receive  with  respect  to the
          participation  sold  to  such  Participant,  unless  the  sale  of the
          participation  to such  Participant is made with the Borrower's  prior
          written  consent.  A Participant  that would be a Foreign Lender if it
          were a Lender  shall not be entitled to the  benefits of Section  5.03
          unless the  Borrower  is notified  of the  participation  sold to such
          Participant  and  such  Participant  agrees,  for the  benefit  of the
          Borrower, to comply with Section 5.03(e) as though it were a Lender.

               (d) Any  Lender  may at any time  pledge  or  assign  a  security
interest  in all or any  portion of its rights  under this  Agreement  to secure
obligations  of such  Lender,  including  any  pledge  or  assignment  to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 12.04(d) shall not apply
to any such pledge or assignment of a security  interest;  provided that no such
pledge or assignment of a security  interest  shall release a Lender from any of
its  obligations  hereunder or substitute  any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto.

         Section 12.05 Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
                       --------------------------------

               (a) All  covenants,  agreements,  representations  and warranties
made  by the  Borrower  herein  and in the  certificates  or  other  instruments
delivered  in  connection  with or pursuant to this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document  shall be  considered  to have been  relied  upon by the other  parties
hereto and shall survive the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement and the
making of any Loans and  issuance  of any Letters of Credit,  regardless  of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and  notwithstanding
that the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank or any  Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or  incorrect  representation  or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder,  and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the  principal  of or any accrued  interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this  Agreement is outstanding  and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the  Commitments  have not
expired or  terminated.  The provisions of Section 5.01,  Section 5.02,  Section
5.03 and Section 12.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,
the  repayment of the Loans,  the  expiration or  termination  of the Letters of
Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement,  any other Loan
Document or any provision hereof or thereof.

                                       85

               (b) To the  extent  that  any  payments  on the  Indebtedness  or
proceeds  of  any  collateral  are  subsequently  invalidated,  declared  to  be
fraudulent  or  preferential,  set aside or  required to be repaid to a trustee,
debtor in possession,  receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common
law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Indebtedness so satisfied shall
be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and
the Administrative  Agent's and the Lenders' Liens, security interests,  rights,
powers and remedies  under this  Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue
in  full  force  and  effect.  In  such  event,  each  Loan  Document  shall  be
automatically  reinstated  and the  Borrower  shall  take such  action as may be
reasonably  requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to effect such
reinstatement.

               (a)  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in  counterparts  (and by
different  parties  hereto  on  different  counterparts),  each of  which  shall

single contract.

               (b) This  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents  and any separate
letter  agreements  with  respect to fees  payable to the  Administrative  Agent

become  effective when it shall have been executed by the  Administrative  Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken  together,  bear the signatures of each of the other parties  hereto,
and  thereafter  shall be binding  upon and inure to the  benefit of the parties
hereto and their  respective  successors  and  assigns.  Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                         ------------
other  Loan  Document  held  to be  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  in any
jurisdiction  shall,  as to such  jurisdiction,  be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity,  illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining  provisions hereof or thereof;  and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular  jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

law, to set off and apply any and all  deposits  (general  or  special,  time or
demand,  provisional  or  final)  at any time  held and  other  obligations  (of

         Section 12.10 Headings.  Article and Section  headings and the Table of
                       --------
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement  and  shall  not  affect  the   construction  of,  or  be  taken  into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 12.11  Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative  Agent, the
                        ---------------
Issuing  Bank and the Lenders  agrees to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a)  to
its and its Affiliates'  directors,  officers,  employees and agents,  including
accountants,  legal  counsel and other  advisors (it being  understood  that the
Persons to whom such  disclosure  is made will be informed  of the  confidential
nature  of  such   Information   and   instructed   to  keep  such   Information
confidential), (b) to  the extent requested by any regulatory  authority, (c) to
the extent  required by  applicable  laws or  regulations  or by any subpoena or
similar legal  process,  (d) to  any other party to this  Agreement or any other
Loan Document, (e) in  connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the  enforcement of rights  hereunder or
thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement  containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section 12.11,  to (i) any assignee  of or Participant in,

                                       88

or  any  prospective  assignee  of or  Participant  in,  any of  its  rights  or
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective  counterparty
(or its  advisors)  to any  Swap  Agreement  relating  to the  Borrower  and its
obligations,  (g)  with the  consent of the  Borrower or (h) to  the extent such
Information  (i)  becomes publicly  available other than as a result of a breach
of this Section 12.11 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a  nonconfidential  basis from a source other than
the Borrower.  For the purposes of this Section 12.11,  "Information"  means all
                                                         -----------
information  received from the Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary  relating to
the Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary  and their  businesses,  other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender on a nonconfidential  basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or
a Material  Subsidiary;  provided that, in the case of information received from
the Borrower or any Material  Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information
is  clearly  identified  at the time of  delivery  as  confidential.  Any Person
required to maintain  the  confidentiality  of  Information  as provided in this
Section 12.11 shall be considered to have complied with its  obligation to do so
if  such  Person  has  exercised  the  same  degree  of  care  to  maintain  the
confidentiality  of such  Information  as such  Person  would  accord to its own
confidential information.

         Section  12.12  Interest  Rate  Limitation.  It is the intention of the
                         --------------------------
parties hereto that each Lender shall conform  strictly to usury laws applicable
to it. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as
to any Lender  under laws  applicable  to it  (including  the laws of the United
States of America  and the State of Texas or any other  jurisdiction  whose laws
may  be  mandatorily   applicable  to  such  Lender  notwithstanding  the  other
provisions of this Agreement),  then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to
the  contrary in any of the Loan  Documents  or any  agreement  entered  into in
connection with or as security for the Notes, it is agreed as  follows:  (i) the
aggregate of all consideration  which constitutes  interest under law applicable
to any Lender that is contracted  for, taken,  reserved,  charged or received by
such Lender  under any of the Loan  Documents  or  agreements  or  otherwise  in
connection with the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount
allowed by such applicable  law, and any excess shall be canceled  automatically
and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount
of the  Indebtedness  (or,  to the  extent  that  the  principal  amount  of the
Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full,  refunded by such
Lender to the Borrower); and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Notes is
accelerated  by reason of an election of the holder  thereof  resulting from any
Event of  Default  under this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  or in the event of any
required or  permitted  prepayment,  then such  consideration  that  constitutes
interest  under law  applicable  to any Lender may never  include  more than the
maximum  amount allowed by such  applicable  law, and excess  interest,  if any,
provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled  automatically  by
such  Lender  as of  the  date  of  such  acceleration  or  prepayment  and,  if
theretofore  paid,  shall be credited by such Lender on the principal  amount of
the  Indebtedness   (or,  to  the  extent  that  the  principal  amount  of  the
Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full,  refunded by such
Lender to the  Borrower).  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any  Lender for
the use,  forbearance  or detention of sums due hereunder  shall,  to the extent
permitted by law applicable to such Lender,  be amortized,  prorated,  allocated
and spread  throughout the stated term of the Loans evidenced by the Notes until
payment in full so that the rate or amount of  interest  on account of any Loans
hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such  applicable law. If
at any time and from  time to time (i) the amount  of  interest  payable  to any
Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest  Lawful Rate  applicable  to
such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.12 and (ii)in respect of any  subsequent

                                       89

interest  computation  period the amount of interest  otherwise  payable to such
Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed
at the  Highest  Lawful  Rate  applicable  to such  Lender,  then the  amount of
interest  payable  to  such  Lender  in  respect  of  such  subsequent  interest
computation  period  shall  continue to be  computed at the Highest  Lawful Rate
applicable  to such Lender  until the total  amount of interest  payable to such
Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to
such Lender if the total amount of interest  had been  computed  without  giving
effect to this  Section  12.12.  To the  extent  that  Chapter  303 of the Texas
Finance Code is relevant for the purpose of determining  the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable  to a Lender,  such Lender elects to determine  the  applicable  rate
ceiling  under such  Chapter by the weekly  ceiling from time to time in effect.
Chapter  346  of the  Texas  Finance  Code  does  not  apply  to the  Borrower's
obligations hereunder.

         Section  12.13  EXCULPATION  PROVISIONS.  EACH  OF THE  PARTIES  HERETO
                         -----------------------
SPECIFICALLY AGREES THAT IT HAS A DUTY TO READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS  AND AGREES THAT IT IS CHARGED WITH NOTICE AND  KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS
OF THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS;  THAT IT HAS IN FACT READ THIS
AGREEMENT AND IS FULLY  INFORMED AND HAS FULL NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS,
CONDITIONS  AND  EFFECTS  OF THIS  AGREEMENT;  THAT IT HAS BEEN  REPRESENTED  BY
INDEPENDENT  LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE  THROUGHOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS  PRECEDING
ITS EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS;  AND HAS RECEIVED
THE ADVICE OF ITS ATTORNEY IN ENTERING  INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS;  AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES  THAT CERTAIN OF THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS RESULT IN ONE PARTY ASSUMING THE LIABILITY INHERENT
IN SOME  ASPECTS  OF THE  TRANSACTION  AND  RELIEVING  THE  OTHER  PARTY  OF ITS
RESPONSIBILITY  FOR SUCH LIABILITY.  EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES AND COVENANTS THAT
IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY EXCULPATORY  PROVISION
OF THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD
NO  NOTICE  OR  KNOWLEDGE  OF  SUCH  PROVISION  OR  THAT  THE  PROVISION  IS NOT
"CONSPICUOUS."

         Section 12.14  Existing  Credit  Agreement.  On the date of the initial
                        ---------------------------
funding,  the loans and other Debt of the  Borrower  under the  Existing  Credit
Agreement shall be paid in full with the proceeds of the initial funding and the
commitments of the lenders  thereunder shall be superseded by this Agreement and
terminated.  To the extent of  $3,000,000,  the Notes  represent  a renewal  and
rearrangement  of the promissory  notes issued  pursuant to the Existing  Credit
Agreement.
