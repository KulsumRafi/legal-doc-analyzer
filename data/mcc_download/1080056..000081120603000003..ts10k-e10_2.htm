<P ALIGN="CENTER">ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN</P>

<p style="text-indent: 60">&nbsp;
<p style="text-indent: 60">	The Company maintains an annual incentive plan whereby certain
employees are eligible to receive cash bonuses equal to a percentage of their base salaries
if certain corporate financial objectives are achieved.  The employees
selected each year to participate in the annual incentive plan, as well as the performance
targets on which the cash bonuses are based and the amount of the cash bonuses are
determined each year in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 60">	Employees in the following categories are eligible to
participate in the plan: members of the senior management team and other
employees who can have a significant impact on the financial results of the
Company.&nbsp; Each year, the Chief Executive Officer recommends to the
Compensation Committee the employees whom he believes should participate in the
plan, and the final determination is made by the Compensation Committee. The
participation of such employees in the plan is evidenced by written notice from
the Company.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 60">If the Company achieves the performance targets set by the
Compensation Committee, the designated management employees receive specified
percentages of their annual salaries in the form of cash bonuses.  Company performance
below the target levels will result in lower or no bonus payments, and Company
performance above the target levels will result in higher bonus payments.</p>
