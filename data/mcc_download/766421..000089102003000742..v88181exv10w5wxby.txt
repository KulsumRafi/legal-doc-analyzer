provide Buyer with pertinent information on components, equipment and
installations designed by Boeing for aircraft of the same model type as the
Aircraft. Such data and documents will be in English and in the units of measure
used by Boeing, except as otherwise specified herein or as may be required to
reflect Aircraft instrumentation.

Digitally-produced data and documents will, where applicable, be prepared
essentially in accordance with the provisions of Revision 0 of Air Transport
Association of America (ATA) Specification 2100, dated January 1994, entitled
"Digital Data Standards for Aircraft Support."

2.    Treatment of Data and Documents.

      2.1 The data and documents provided by Boeing under this Agreement
("Documents") are licensed to Buyer. They contain confidential, proprietary
and/or trade secret information belonging to Boeing; and Buyer will treat them
in confidence and use and disclose them only for Buyer's own internal purposes
as specifically authorized herein. If Buyer makes copies of any Documents, the
copies will also belong to Boeing and be treated as Documents under this
Agreement. Buyer will preserve all restrictive legends and proprietary notices
on all Documents and copies.


                                      D-1

      2.2 All Documents will only be used: (a) for the purpose of maintenance,
repair, or modification of an Aircraft or spare part as permitted in the Spare
Parts GTA or Customer Services GTA between Buyer and Boeing, and then only in
connection with an Aircraft or spare part for which the Document in question is
tabulated or identified by Boeing serial number, and (b) for the purpose of
Buyer's own development and manufacture of training devices for use by Buyer, in
connection with the Aircraft.

      2.3 Any Document may be provided to Buyer's contractors for maintenance,
repair, or modification of the Aircraft; and Airplane Flight Manuals, Operations
Manuals, Aircraft Maintenance Manuals, Wiring Diagram Manuals, System Schematics
Manuals, Component Maintenance/Overhaul Manuals and assembly and installation
drawings may be provided to Buyer's contractors for development and manufacture
of training devices for use by Buyer, but in both cases, only if Buyer's
contractor is, at the time of transfer of Documents, bound by a Boeing Customer
Services GTA, or other appropriate proprietary information protection agreement
with Boeing, applicable to the Documents.

3.    Document Formats and Quantities.

      The Attachment is provided to record the quantities and formats of
Documents provided to Buyer which are applicable to aircraft previously
delivered by Boeing of the same model type as the Aircraft. Revisions to such
Documents will be provided as necessary to reflect the configuration, at time of
delivery, of the Aircraft to which this Part D applies. Space is provided in the
Attachment for Buyer and Boeing to indicate changes, mutually agreed upon
concurrently with signing this Agreement, in the quantities and formats of such
Documents to be hereinafter provided.

In the event Boeing determines that revisions would not be appropriate for any
of the Documents described in the Attachment, Boeing reserves the right to
furnish to Buyer, in lieu of such revisions, a separate publication of such
Document for the Aircraft in the same format and quantity as indicated in the
Attachment. Revision service for such publication will be the same as for the

4.    Revision Service.

      Further revisions to any such documents will be provided as set forth in
the original purchase agreement, purchase agreement supplement, or as may have
been amended by the parties, for such aircraft.

5.    Supplier Technical Data.

      Boeing will continue to maintain the supplier data program referred to in
the purchase agreement or purchase agreement supplement under which data and
documents for Buyer's aircraft of the same model type as the Aircraft were
originally provided to Buyer. As indicated in such prior purchase agreement or
supplement, the provisions of such supplier data program are not applicable to
items of Buyer Furnished Equipment.

6.    Additional Data and Documents.

      If Boeing provides data or documents other than Documents which are not
covered by a Boeing Customer Services GTA or other proprietary information
protection agreement between Boeing and Buyer, all such data and documents will
be considered things delivered under this Agreement and treated as Documents.

7.    Buyer's Shipping Address.

      Boeing will ship the Documents furnished hereunder to Buyer's shipping
address for data and documents previously provided to Boeing. Buyer shall
promptly notify Boeing of any change to such address.

8.    Data and Document Quantities.

      Buyer and Boeing will jointly determine the quantities for the materials
listed below no later than one year prior to the scheduled delivery of the first
Model 737-790 Aircraft.

                 BUYER'S INDEMNIFICATION OF BOEING AND INSURANCE

1.    Buyer's Indemnification Of Boeing.

      Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Boeing from and against all
claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incident thereto or incident to successfully establishing the right to
indemnification, for injury to or death of any person or persons, including
employees of Buyer but not employees of Boeing, or for loss of or damage to any
property, including Aircraft, arising out of or in any way related to the
performance by Boeing of training, services or other obligations pursuant to
this Exhibit C, whether or not arising in tort or occasioned in whole or in part
by the negligence of Boeing, whether active, passive or imputed.

      1.1   With regard to training, services and obligations other than Revenue
Service Training, the foregoing indemnification will not apply to the legal
liability to persons or parties other than Buyer or Buyer's assignees arising
out of an accident caused solely by a product defect in an Aircraft.

      1.2   With regard to Revenue Service Training, the foregoing
indemnification will apply to the legal liability to persons or parties other
than Buyer or Buyer's assignees, even if arising out of an accident caused
solely by a product defect in an Aircraft.

2.    Buyer's Insurance.

      Evidence of insurance will be required 30 days prior to the scheduled
delivery of the first Aircraft. Accordingly, Buyer will provide certificates of
insurance specifically referencing the Agreement and paragraph 1 of this Part E.
In addition to showing policy number, limits of liability, and effective dates
of coverage, such certificates will contain but not be limited to the following
provisions:


                                      E-1
<PAGE>
      2.1   Hull All Risk; Hull War & Allied Perils Insurance.

            Insurers and/or reinsurers will hold harmless and waive all rights
of subrogation against Boeing for any damages or claims arising out of these
Exhibit C services.

      2.2   Aircraft Liability Insurance.

            (a)   To name Boeing as an additional insured in connection with the
performance by Boeing of training, services, or other obligations provided under
this Exhibit C.

            (b)   To provide that the insurance arranged herein will be primary
and without right of contribution with respect to any other insurance which may
be available for the protection of Boeing.

            (c)   To provide that all provisions of the insurance, except the
limits of liability, will operate to give each insured or additional insured the
same protection as if there were a separate policy issued covering each insured
or additional insured.

            (d)   To provide that no act, omission, breach of any warranty or
condition, or misrepresentation on the part of the Insured or any other person
or party (other than by Boeing) will void, exclude, minimize, or adversely
change this coverage as it applies to Boeing.

      2.3   For Coverages Specified in 2.1 and 2.2.

            (a)   Acknowledgment that the insurers and/or reinsurers are aware
of and have seen a copy of the Agreement and accept and insure the risks and
indemnity herein to the extent of the coverage and endorsements as described in
this certificate.

            (b)   To give 30 day written notice of cancellation, termination or
adverse material alteration of the policies (7 day written notice in the event
of War Risk or such lesser period as may be in effect with prior notice).

            (c)   That Boeing will not be responsible for payment, set off, or
assessment of any kind of any premiums in connection with the policies,
endorsements or coverages described herein.

and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents.

If more than one Aircraft is to be delivered under the Purchase Agreement, the
insurance certificates must reference all Aircraft when delivered or separate
certificates must be supplied for each Aircraft. The certificates of insurance
will be kept current and valid.

                BUYER'S INDEMNIFICATION OF BOEING AND INSURANCE


1.       Buyer's Indemnification Of Boeing.

         Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Boeing from and against all
claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incident thereto or incident to successfully establishing the right to
indemnification, for injury to or death of any person or persons, including
employees of Buyer but not employees of Boeing, or for loss of or damage to any
property, including Aircraft, arising out of or in any way related to the
performance by Boeing of training, services or other obligations pursuant to
this Exhibit C, whether or not arising in tort or occasioned in whole or in part
by the negligence of Boeing, whether active, passive or imputed.

         1.1      With regard to training, services and obligations other than
Revenue Service Training, the foregoing indemnification will not apply to the
legal liability to persons or parties other than Buyer or Buyer's assignees
arising out of an accident caused solely by a product defect in an Aircraft.

         1.2      With regard to Revenue Service Training, the foregoing
indemnification will apply to the legal liability to persons or parties other
than Buyer or Buyer's assignees, even if arising out of an accident caused
solely by a product defect in an Aircraft.

2.       Buyer's Insurance.

         Evidence of insurance will be required 30 days prior to the scheduled
delivery of the first Aircraft. Accordingly, Buyer will provide certificates of
insurance specifically referencing the Agreement and paragraph 1 of this Part E.
In addition to showing policy number, limits of liability, and effective dates
of coverage, such certificates will contain but not be limited to the following
provisions:


                                      E-1
<PAGE>
         2.1      Hull All Risk; Hull War & Allied Perils Insurance.

         Insurers and/or reinsurers will hold harmless and waive all rights of
subrogation against Boeing for any damages or claims arising out of these
Exhibit C services.

         2.2      Aircraft Liability Insurance.

                  (a)      To name Boeing as an additional insured in connection
with the performance by Boeing of training, services, or other obligations
provided under this Exhibit C.

                  (b)      To provide that the insurance arranged herein will be
primary and without right of contribution with respect to any other insurance
which may be available for the protection of Boeing.

                  (c)      To provide that all provisions of the insurance,
except the limits of liability, will operate to give each insured or additional
insured the same protection as if there were a separate policy issued covering
each insured or additional insured.

                  (d)      To provide that no act, omission, breach of any
warranty or condition, or misrepresentation on the part of the Insured or any
other person or party (other than by Boeing) will void, exclude, minimize, or
adversely change this coverage as it applies to Boeing.

         2.3      For Coverages Specified in 2.1 and 2.2.

                  (a)      Acknowledgment that the insurers and/or reinsurers
are aware of and have seen a copy of the Agreement and accept and insure the
risks and indemnity herein to the extent of the coverage and endorsements as
described in this certificate.

                  (b)      To give 30 day written notice of cancellation,
termination or adverse material alteration of the policies (7 day written notice
in the event of War Risk or such lesser period as may be in effect with prior
notice).

                  (c)      That Boeing will not be responsible for payment, set
off, or assessment of any kind of any premiums in connection with the policies,
endorsements or coverages described herein.

as The Boeing Company, its divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, the assignees of
each and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents.

If more than one Aircraft is to be delivered under the Purchase Agreement, the
insurance certificates must reference all Aircraft when delivered or separate
certificates must be supplied for each Aircraft. The certificates of insurance
will be kept current and valid.

                    Alleviation or Cessation of Performance


Boeing will not be required to provide any services, training, data or goods at
a facility while:

         1.       a labor stoppage or dispute in progress involving Buyer
exists;

         2.       wars or warlike operations, riots or insurrections in the
country where such facility is located exist;

         3.       conditions at such facility which, in the opinion of Boeing,
are detrimental to the general health, welfare or safety of its personnel and/or
their families exist;

         4.       the United States Government refuses permission to any Boeing
personnel or their families to enter the country where such facility is located,
or recommends that any Boeing personnel or their families leave such country; or

         5.       the United States Government refuses Boeing permission to
deliver goods or services to the country where such facility is located.

Boeing further reserves the right, upon the occurrence of any of such events,
subsequent to the location of Boeing personnel at Buyer's facility, to
immediately and without prior notice relocate its personnel and their families
to a place of Boeing's choosing. Any delay resulting therefrom will be deemed a
delay by mutual agreement.

4.       Boeing's Obligations.

         Other than as set forth below, Boeing will provide for the installation
of and install the BFE and obtain certification of the Aircraft with the BFE
installed.

5.       Nonperformance by Buyer.

         If Buyer's nonperformance of obligations in this Exhibit or in the BFE
Document causes a delay in the delivery of the Aircraft or causes Boeing to
perform out-of-sequence or additional work, Buyer will reimburse Boeing for all
resulting expenses and be deemed to have agreed to any such delay in Aircraft
delivery. In addition Boeing will have the right to:

         5.1      provide and install specified equipment or suitable alternate

benefit would have, but will not be liable for loss of use.

occasioned in whole or in part by the active, passive or imputed negligence of

claims, suits, actions, liabilities, damages and costs arising out of any actual

Seattle, Washington 98188


Subject: Letter Agreement No. 1954-2R2 to
         Purchase Agreement No. 1954 -
         Seller Purchased Equipment

This Letter Agreement amends Purchase Agreement No. 1954 dated as of even date
herewith (the Agreement) between The Boeing Company (Boeing) and Alaska
Airlines, Inc. (Buyer) relating to Model 737 aircraft (the Aircraft).

For purposes of this Letter Agreement the following definitions apply:

Seller Purchased Equipment (SPE) is Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE) that Boeing
purchases for Buyer.

Developmental Buyer Furnished Equipment (DBFE) is all BFE not previously
certified for installation on the same model aircraft.

Developmental Seller Purchased Equipment (DSPE) is DBFE which is converted to
SPE.

This Letter Agreement does not include developmental avionics. Developmental
avionics are avionics that have not been previously certified for installation
on the same model aircraft.

Boeing and Buyer acknowledge that there are no items of DBFE or DSPE in Buyer's
detail specification D6-38900-1C dated August 29, 1996, nor will there be any
such items in either Buyer's detail specification D019A001ASA37P-1, or in
Buyer's detail specification D019A001ASA39P-1, each to be dated when issued
(with the date of issue).

All other terms used herein and in the Agreement, and not defined above, will
have the same meaning as in the Agreement.
<PAGE>
Alaska Airlines, Inc
1954-2R2        Page 2


Buyer has requested that Boeing purchase as SPE the BFE which has been changed
to SPE as reflected in the Detail Specification. Accordingly, Boeing and Buyer
agree as follows:

1.       Price.

         Advance Payments. An estimated SPE price will be included in the
Aircraft Advance Payment Base Price for the purpose of establishing the advance
payments for each Aircraft. The estimated price of the SPE for each Current
Generation Aircraft as identified in the Detail Specification as of the date
hereof, is *** The estimated price of the SPE for each Model 737-790 Aircraft as
identified in the Detail Specification as of the date hereof, *** The estimated
price of the SPE for each Model 737-990 Aircraft as identified in the Detail
Specification as of the date hereof, ***

         Aircraft Price. The Aircraft Price will be adjusted to reflect (i) the
actual costs charged Boeing by the SPE suppliers, (ii) a handling fee of *** and
(iii) transportation charges. If at some future date, Buyer's configuration is
revised to include any DBFE and all DBFE, except for developmental avionics, is
converted to SPE, Boeing will waive the handling fee for all SPE.

2.       Responsibilities.

         2.1      If Buyer elects to convert additional BFE to SPE, Buyer is
                  responsible for:


                  (i)      selecting the supplier on or before:


                  Current Generation Aircraft:

                  Not Applicable                          for galleys
                  Not Applicable                          for seats;

                  New Generation Aircraft:

                  Not Applicable                          for galleys
                  Not Applicable                          for seats;

                  (ii)     selecting a FAA certifiable part; and


                  (iii)    providing to Boeing the SPE part specification/Buyer
                           requirements.


         2.2.     Boeing is responsible for:


                  (i)      placing and managing the purchase order with the
supplier;


                  (ii)     coordinating with the suppliers on technical issues;


                  (iii)    ensuring that the delivered SPE complies with the
part specification;


                  (iv)     obtaining certification of the Aircraft with the SPE
installed; and


                  (v)      obtaining for Buyer the supplier's standard warranty
for the SPE. SPE is deemed to be BFE for purposes of Exhibit B, the Product
Assurance Document, of the Agreement.

3.       Changes.


         After this Letter Agreement is signed, changes to SPE may only be made
by and between Boeing and the suppliers. Buyer's contacts with SPE suppliers
relating to design (including selection of materials and colors), weights,
prices or schedules are for informational purposes only. If Buyer wants changes
made to any of the above, requests must be made directly to Boeing for
negotiating with the supplier.

1954-2R2        Page 4


4.       Proprietary Rights.

         Boeing's obligation to purchase SPE will not impose upon Boeing any
obligation to compensate Buyer or any supplier for any proprietary rights Buyer
may have in the design of the SPE.

5.       Remedies.

         If Buyer does not comply with the obligations above, Boeing may:

         (i)      delay delivery of the Aircraft;

         (ii)     deliver the Aircraft without installing the SPE;

         (iii)    substitute a comparable part and invoice Buyer for the cost;

         (iv)     increase the Aircraft Price by the amount of Boeing's
additional costs attributable to such noncompliance.

6.       Buyer's Indemnification of Boeing.

         Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Boeing from and against all
claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incident thereto or incident to successfully establishing the right to
indemnification, for injury to or death of any person or persons, including
employees of Buyer but not employees of Boeing, or for loss of or damage to any
property, including Aircraft, arising out of or in any way connected with any
nonconformance or defect in any SPE and whether or not arising in tort or
occasioned in whole or in part by the negligence of Boeing, whether active,
passive or imputed. This indemnity will not

installation of the SPE. Very truly yours,

method of shipment for initial deliveries and all subsequent deliveries of such
Spare Parts will be as mutually agreed between Boeing and Buyer.

6.       Substitution for Obsolete Spare Parts.

         6.1      Obligation to Substitute. In the event that, prior to delivery
of the first Aircraft of a particular model type (a 737-400, a 737-700, etc.)
pursuant to the Agreement, any Spare Part purchased by Buyer from Boeing in
accordance with this letter is rendered obsolete or unusable due to the redesign
of the Aircraft of such model type, or of any accessory, equipment or part
therefor, (other than a redesign at Buyer's request), Boeing will deliver to
Buyer new and usable Spare Parts in substitution for such obsolete or unusable
Spare Parts and Buyer will return the obsolete or unusable Spare Parts to
Boeing. Boeing will credit Buyer's account with Boeing with the price paid by
Buyer for any such obsolete or unusable Spare Part and will invoice Buyer for
the purchase price of any such substitute Spare Part delivered to Buyer.

Subject:       Maintenance Cost Protection

Reference:     Purchase Agreement @ (the Purchase Agreement) between The
               Boeing Company (Boeing) and # (Buyer) relating to Model *
               aircraft (the Aircraft)

This Letter Agreement amends the Purchase Agreement and Exhibit C of the AGTA.
All terms used but not defined in this Letter Agreement have the same meaning as
in the Purchase Agreement and AGTA.

1.         Intent.

           The Airframe Maintenance Cost Protection Program described in this
Letter Agreement (the Program) is intended to address Buyer's concerns regarding
airframe maintenance costs. The Program is based on a projection by Boeing of
target costs for airframe maintenance. These target costs are developed at the
time of Aircraft purchase using Buyer's forecast of its operation of the
Aircraft. Target costs will be adjusted during the Program to reflect Buyer's
actual operation of the Aircraft. Buyer's actual costs will be compared against
these adjusted target costs and Boeing will take corrective action if the
Program targets are not met.

2.         Definitions.

COVERED AIRCRAFT:  Each of the Aircraft operated by Buyer on Buyer's routes
during the Program Term.

PROGRAM TERM: The five (5) consecutive years commencing on the first day of the
calendar quarter in which the first Covered Aircraft is delivered by Boeing to
Buyer.

COVERED MAINTENANCE: Labor performed and materials used in the maintenance of
the airframe and component elements of the Covered Aircraft (excluding Engines
and Engine parts provided by the Engine manufacturer and the Engine
manufacturer's suppliers) where the maintenance is performance as part of a
maintenance program approved by Buyer's regulatory authority. These airframe and
component elements are defined in the Air Transport Association of America
(ATA), Specification No. 100, ("Specification for Manufacturer's Technical
Data," dated 1984) as aircraft systems 5, 7 through 11, relevant sections of 12
and 20, 21 through 57, 71, and 73 through 80. All labor and materials must be
properly charged to the following work descriptions:

           SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE:  All routine and required non-routine or
           corrective maintenance performed by Buyer during scheduled checks
           and line maintenance.

           NON-SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE:  All non-scheduled required maintenance.

           REPAIR AND OVERHAUL:  Any required repair or overhaul of rotable
           or repairable systems, accessories, equipment or parts.

           MODIFICATIONS:  Modifications required to make changes recommended
           by Boeing or Boeing Suppliers pursuant to paragraphs 4.3 and 5.1
           herein.
<PAGE>
ACTUAL MAINTENANCE COST: The total cost incurred by Buyer related to performing
Covered Maintenance, and is the sum of three components; (i) the Direct Airframe
Material Cost Component, (ii) the Direct Airframe Labor Cost Component, and
(iii) the Subcontracted Airframe Cost Component.

DIRECT AIRFRAME MATERIAL COST COMPONENT (DIRECT MATERIAL): The net actual cost
paid by Buyer for materials required to perform the Covered Maintenance,
exclusive of those cost and/or other charges as set forth in paragraph 5.5 which
may be added to the manufacturer's standard price.

DIRECT AIRFRAME LABOR COST COMPONENT (DIRECT LABOR):  The product of:

        (i) LABOR HOURS. The hours actually expended by Buyer in performing the
        Covered Maintenance, exclusive of time consumed by employees while
        waiting for work, traveling to or from work, training, vacation, sick
        leave, or in any other similar absences from the actual maintenance
        work,

        and

        (ii) LABOR RATE. The average direct hourly labor rate (excluding all
        fringe benefits, premium time allowances, social charges, business taxes
        and the like), paid to Buyer's employees who actually perform the
        Covered Maintenance.

SUBCONTRACTED AIRFRAME MAINTENANCE COST COMPONENT (SUBCONTRACTED Maintenance):
The maintenance charges to Buyer for labor and materials where the maintenance
is performed for Buyer by others, adjusted to Buyer's equivalent direct labor
and material costs, and such adjusted amount is distributed to the material cost
component and to the labor cost component

CUMULATIVE AVERAGE ACTUAL MAINTENANCE COST: The aggregate Actual Maintenance
Cost for all then-completed Reporting Periods divided by the Fleet Hours for all
such completed Reporting Periods.

           REPORTING PERIOD:  A twelve-month period beginning on either the
           date the Program Term commences or on an annual anniversary
           thereof.

           FLEET HOURS:  The total airborne time (aircraft
           takeoff-to-touchdown) accumulated by the Fleet during a Reporting
           Period.

                     FLEET:  The number of Covered Aircraft operated by Buyer
                     during a Reporting Period.

CUMULATIVE AVERAGE TARGET MAINTENANCE COST: For any Reporting Period, the sum of
the products of the Target Maintenance Cost multiplied by the comparable Fleet
Hours divided by the total Fleet Hours for all completed Reporting Periods.

           TARGET MAINTENANCE COST: A dollar value per flight hour, which will
           be the sum of the Target Material Cost and Target Labor Cost for a
           Reporting Period.

3.         Methodology.

           3.1       General.


                     Because maintenance costs are influenced by a number of
operational, economic, and financial factors, Boeing at this time can only
project the Target Maintenance Costs. During the Program Term, Boeing will
calculate Target Maintenance Costs using actual data on these factors when the
data becomes available.
<PAGE>
This Letter Agreement describes projected Target Maintenance Costs for each
Reporting Period. These Target Maintenance Costs have been calculated using
certain assumptions about Buyer's operation and maintenance of the Aircraft.
Upon receipt of Buyer's actual data for these assumptions and information
regarding Buyer's actual operation, Boeing will report Target Maintenance Costs
for each Reporting Period to Buyer.

Boeing will also calculate and report to Buyer the Cumulative Average Target
Maintenance Cost, which is the benchmark for Program compliance. If the
Cumulative Average Actual Maintenance Cost exceeds 110% of the Cumulative
Average Target Maintenance Cost, Boeing will take corrective action as defined
in paragraph 4.3.

Buyer will report costs in Buyer's currency.  All other costs related to the
Program will be expressed in U.S. dollars.

           3.2       Projected Target Maintenance Costs.

                     The Projected Target Maintenance Costs are estimates of
the anticipated costs of maintaining the Covered Aircraft for a specified period
of time, taking into account assumptions regarding projected average flight
time, projected average yearly utilization, a projected labor rate and a
projected proportion of airframe maintenance to be performed by subcontractors
(Projected Target Maintenance Costs). Projected Target Maintenance Costs are
established for each Reporting Period in year + dollars.

The Projected Target Maintenance Cost is the sum of a projected target material
cost and a projected target labor cost. These values are based on a projected
average time per flight for the Fleet of + hours (Projected Average Flight
Time), and a projected Labor Rate of $ per man hour.

The calculation of Projected Target Maintenance Cost, expressed as a dollar
value per flight hour, is based on the assumption that Subcontracted Maintenance
will amount to no more than 10% of Covered Maintenance. Subcontracted
Maintenance cost is allocated + % to the projected target labor cost and + % to
the projected material cost.

Accordingly, Projected Target Maintenance Costs for each Reporting Period are
as follows:

           3.3       Target Maintenance Costs.


                     For each Reporting Period, Boeing will calculate Target
Maintenance Costs by adjusting (as described in Attachment A) the Projected
Target Maintenance Cost to reflect actual data for the following parameters:

           (a)       Buyer's labor rate,
           (b)       Percentage of Covered Maintenance which is subcontracted,
           (c)       Average flight time,
           (d)       Number of Covered Aircraft,
           (e)       Utilization of the Covered Aircraft,
           (f)       Delivery schedule of the Covered Aircraft,
           (g)       Material price inflation,
           (h)       Currency exchange rate.

Buyer will report data to Boeing for parameters (a) through (e), and Boeing will
acquire data for parameters (f) through (h). For each Reporting Period, Boeing
will calculate the Target Maintenance Costs and the Cumulative Average Target
Maintenance Cost.

           3.4       Actual Maintenance Costs.


                     For each Reporting Period, Buyer will report Actual
Maintenance Costs incurred in performing Covered Maintenance for the Covered
Aircraft. Actual Maintenance Costs will be reported for each of the four
activities listed in paragraph 2.2, in three components (Direct Material, Direct
Labor, and Subcontracted Maintenance):

           (a)       The component of airframe material cost incurred
                     directly by Buyer (Direct Material);
           (b)       The component of airframe labor cost incurred directly
                     by Buyer (Direct Labor); and
           (c)       The component airframe maintenance cost performed by
                     others (Subcontracted Maintenance).

Boeing will adjust (as described in Attachment A) the Subcontracted Maintenance
cost to equivalent direct Buyer labor and material cost levels. Such adjusted
subcontracted maintenance will then be allocated to the Direct Labor And Direct
Material components. The Actual Maintenance Costs will be the sum of such
revised Direct Labor and Direct Maintenance cost components, and will be used
along with Fleet Hours to calculate the Cumulative Average Actual Maintenance
Cost as a dollar value per flight hour.
<PAGE>
           3.5       Program Compliance.

                     Compliance with the Program will be achieved if the
Cumulative Average Actual Maintenance Cost does not exceed 110% of the
Cumulative Average Target Maintenance Cost. If compliance is not achieved,
Boeing will take corrective action as defined in paragraph 4.3.

4.         Obligations.

           4.1       Buyer's Obligation under the Program.


                     4.1.1     Buyer will report to Boeing within 90 days
after the last day of each Reporting Period, the following data for that
Reporting Period:

           (a)       Direct Labor costs,
           (b)       Direct Material costs,
           (c)       Subcontracted Maintenance costs,
           (d)       Buyer's direct Labor Rate per man-hour,
           (e)       The actual Average Flight Time per flight for the Fleet,
           (f)       The number of Covered Aircraft included in the Fleet,

For Buyer's convenience, a form for reporting the above information is included
as Exhibit A to this Letter Agreement.

Failure to provide these reports to Boeing within the 90 day period will
constitute an acknowledgment by Buyer that the Program is in compliance.
However, if the Program should subsequently become non-compliant, Buyer will,
within 90 days after the last day of the applicable Reporting Period, report to
Boeing the data identified above for all then-completed Reporting Periods of the
Program Term.

                     4.1.2     If the Program is determined to be
non-compliant, Buyer will, upon request, submit to Boeing sufficient information
to allow Boeing:

           (a)       To verify cost elements of the Actual Maintenance Cost
                     as defined in paragraph 3.4,

           (b)       To verify the Fleet, Fleet Hours, and the Actual Average
                     Flight Time per flight,

                           4.3 Corrective Action.

                               If the Program is non-compliant as defined in
paragraph 3.5 and Buyer provides its reports to Boeing pursuant to paragraph
4.1, then Boeing will:

                           4.3.1.a. Investigate the circumstances and possible
causes of the non-compliance, and

                           4.3.1.b. Provide technical assistance to Buyer in the
form of analysis and recommendations of a kind and nature which Boeing
determines to be best suited for reducing Actual Maintenance Cost.

                           4.3.2.a. If necessary, initiate a design review of
the systems, accessories, equipment or parts determined by Boeing to be the
primary cause of the non-compliance and, when in Boeing's judgment a redesign is
indicated as a technically and economically practicable means of attaining
Program compliance, Boeing will redesign or cause the redesign of such items,
and

                           4.3.2.b. If such redesign results in retrofit kits
being offered by Boeing or Boeing's suppliers, Boeing will provide such kits or
cause such kits to be provided at no charge to Buyer. Boeing will also
reimburse, at Boeing's then existing Warranty labor rate, Buyer's reasonable
direct labor costs for incorporation of any such kit manufactured to Boeing's,
or Boeing's supplier's, detailed design. Such reimbursement will be provided
pursuant to Exhibit C, Product Assurance Document, of the AGTA.

5.         Conditions and Limitations.
<PAGE>
           5.1 If, with the intent of reducing Covered Maintenance Costs, Boeing
or any supplier issues service bulletins, service letters or other written
instructions or offers no-charge retrofit kits, Buyer will comply with such
instructions or install such kits within a period of 240 days after issuance of
such instructions or receipt of such kits at Buyer's facility, or such longer
period as may be mutually agreed by the parties. If Buyer does not comply with
the time requirements of this paragraph, all airframe maintenance costs which
Boeing determines would have been eliminated if such instructions or kits had
been incorporated, will be subtracted from the Actual Maintenance Costs reported
after expiration of such time requirements.

           5.2 Buyer will promptly notify Boeing in writing of any variations in
its maintenance cost accounting system or procedures which would affect the
proper reporting of Actual Maintenance Costs. Boeing will have the right to make
adjustments to the Cumulative Average Target Maintenance Cost to reflect the
effect of any such variations.

           5.3 Upon reasonable notice to Buyer, Boeing will have the right to
audit all Actual Maintenance Costs reported by Buyer, as well as the maintenance
practices and procedures related thereto during the Program Term. Boeing will
also have the right to disapprove costs it deems improperly reported. Boeing
will provide Buyer written notification of its disapproval of any such costs,
and if Buyer does not provide proof that such costs are properly chargeable
within 60 days after such notification, Boeing's disapproval will be deemed
final and conclusive and Boeing may deduct such costs from the computation of
Actual Maintenance Costs.

           5.4 Upon reasonable notice to Buyer, Boeing may inspect Buyer's
maintenance facilities, programs and procedures. If Boeing recommends in writing
reasonable changes to Buyer's maintenance programs and procedures which would
reduce Actual Maintenance Costs and Buyer does not implement such changes or
Buyer delays implementing such changes beyond the period set forth in paragraph
5.1, Boeing will have the right to adjust the Actual Maintenance Costs that have
been reported to deduct the increased maintenance costs which Boeing estimates
resulted from Buyer's failure or delay in implementing such changes.

           5.5       The Actual Maintenance Cost will not include the
                     following:

                           Attachment A - Adjustments

For each reporting period, Boeing will calculate Target Maintenance Costs by
revising the Projected Target Maintenance Cost to reflect actual data for the
following parameters:

Material Price Inflation

Material prices will be adjusted using Producer Price Indexes as defined below.
The Target Material Cost for a Reporting Period will be calculated by
multiplying the projected target material cost by the ratio of the average index
for the Reporting Period to the index related to the projected target material
cost.

The measure of material price inflation will be the Producer Price Index for
"Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment, n.e.c." (Standard Industrial
Classification Code 3728). This index will be obtained from the publication
"Producer Prices and Price Indexes" published by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics or any comparable successor publication published by
the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or any comparable
successor agency.

Labor Cost

The projected target labor cost will be adjusted to reflect Buyer's actual Labor
Cost. The Target Labor Cost will be calculated by multiplying the Projected
Target Labor Cost by the ratio of Buyer's then-current Labor Rate to the Labor
Rate used to calculate the projected target labor cost for that Reporting
Period.

Airframe Maintenance Performed by Others (Subcontracted Maintenance)


The Projected Target Material Cost and Projected Target Labor Cost assume that
Subcontracted Maintenance, will be no more than 10% of the Cumulative Average
Reported Cost as of any reporting period. If Subcontracted Maintenance amounts
to more than 10% of the Cumulative Average Actual Maintenance Cost as of any
reporting period, Boeing reserves the right to revise the Target Material Cost
and Target Labor Cost for that Reporting Period accordingly.

To adjust Subcontracted Maintenance to Buyer's equivalent direct labor and
direct material costs, Subcontracted Maintenance will be reduced by _____
percent before it is distributed to Direct Labor and Direct Material.

Covered Aircraft

The Projected Target Maintenance Costs are based on the number of Covered
Aircraft. If the number of Covered Aircraft changes during any Reporting Period,
Boeing reserves the right to incorporate such change when calculating the Target
Maintenance Costs for that Reporting Period.

Delivery Schedule

The Projected Target Maintenance Costs are based on the delivery schedule of
Covered Aircraft as described in Article 2 of the Purchase Agreement. If the
delivery schedule for the Covered Aircraft changes during any Reporting Period,
Boeing reserves the right to incorporate such change when calculating the Target
Maintenance Costs for that Reporting Period.

Average Flight Time

If the Actual Average Flight Time (AAFT) for any Reporting Period differs from
the Projected Average Flight Time (PAFT) of ___ hours, the Target Material Cost
(TMC) and Target Labor Cost (TLC) for that reporting period will be adjusted as
follows:

Utilization

The Projected Target Maintenance Costs assume a Projected Average Yearly
Utilization for the Covered Aircraft during any reporting period of _____ flight
hours per aircraft. If the Average Yearly Utilization for the Covered Aircraft
for any Reporting Period exceeds _____ flight hours or is less than _____ flight
hours , Boeing reserves the right to incorporate such change when calculating
the Target Maintenance Costs for that Reporting Period.

Currency Exchange Rate

The Actual Maintenance Costs and average Labor Rates reported by Buyer for any
Reporting Period will be converted by Boeing from __________ to U.S. Dollars
using the average of the four quarterly "rf" (period average) factors applicable
to such Reporting Period ("Exchange Rate") as set forth in the publication
"International Financial Statistics" published by the International Monetary
Fund.

Target Maintenance Costs for any Reporting Period will be adjusted to reflect
any differences between the Exchange Rate for such Reporting Period and the
________ to U.S. Dollar rate of __________, which was used to calculate the
Projected Target Maintenance Costs (Projected Exchange Rate).

(Additional information regarding the publication "International Financial
Statistics" may be obtained from:  Publications Unit, International Monetary
Fund, Washington, D.C. 20431, U.S.A. or by calling U.S.A. Area Code (202)
623-7430.)

Covered Aircraft Configuration

The Target Maintenance Cost set forth in this Program is based on the
configuration for the Covered Aircraft as set forth in Exhibit A to the Purchase
