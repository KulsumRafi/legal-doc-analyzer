mitigation.</P>

of employment with the Corporation in the circumstances set out in this Section
5.3 and will not be construed as a penalty.</P>

<P>(ii)   maintain during the Waiting Period and during any period in which the
Executive is receiving long term disability benefits pursuant to the

which are normally continued for the Corporation's employees who are
in receipt of either short term disability benefits or long term disability
benefits; </P>

<P>(iii)  give the Executive credit under the Corporation's pension plan for an
additional period of service with the Corporation equal to the Waiting

within six (6) months from the Date of Disability all options granted to
the Executive on or after January 28, 2002 and held by the Executive at
the Date of Termination that have vested on the Date of Termination or
would otherwise vest during the twelve (12) months period following
the Date of Termination and permit the Executive or his legal
representative to exercise all other options vested on the Date of
Disability within such six (6) months period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event may any option be exercised after the expiration
of the Option Period (as defined under the Stock Option Plan in effect
from time to time).      </P>

<P>(c)    The Executive and the Corporation agree that the termination of the Executive's
employment by the Corporation by reason of Permanent Disability is not
contrary to the <EM>Ontario Human Rights Code</EM> and that further accommodation
would be undue hardship on the Corporation.</P>
