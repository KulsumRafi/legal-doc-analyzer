     2.01 Committed Loans.

     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally
agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Committed  Loan") to the Borrower  from
time to  time,  on any  Business  Day  during  the  Availability  Period,  in an
aggregate  amount  not to  exceed  at any time  outstanding  the  amount of such
Lender's  Commitment;  provided,  however,  that  after  giving  effect  to  any
Committed  Borrowing,  (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate
Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of
any Lender,  plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding  Amount of all
L/C Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment.  Within the limits of
each Lender's Commitment,  and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof,
the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01,  prepay under Section 2.05, and
reborrow  under this  Section  2.01.  Committed  Loans may be Base Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.

     2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed Loans.

     (a) Each Committed  Borrowing,  each conversion of Committed Loans from one
Type to the other, and each  continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made
upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be
given by  telephone.  Each such notice  must be  received by the  Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three  Business  Days prior to the requested
date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Committed  Loans, and
(ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed  Loans.  Each
telephonic  notice by the  Borrower  pursuant to this  Section  2.02(a)  must be
confirmed  promptly  by  delivery  to  the  Administrative  Agent  of a  written
Committed  Loan  Notice,  appropriately  completed  and signed by a  Responsible
Officer of the Borrower.  Each Borrowing of,  conversion to or  continuation  of
Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall be in a principal  amount of  $3,000,000 or a whole
multiple  of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof.  Except as  provided  in  Sections
2.03(c),  each  Borrowing of Base Rate  Committed  Loans shall be in a principal
amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Except as
provided in Sections 2.03(c), each conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans shall
be in a principal  amount of $500,000 or a whole  multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof.  Each  Committed  Loan Notice  (whether  telephonic  or written)  shall
specify  (i)  whether  the  Borrower is  requesting  a  Committed  Borrowing,  a
conversion of Committed  Loans from one Type to the other,  or a continuation of


                                       19
<PAGE>

Eurodollar Rate Loans,  (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing,  conversion or
continuation,  as the case may be (which  shall be a  Business  Day),  (iii) the
principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)
the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing  Committed Loans
are to be converted, and (v) if applicable,  the duration of the Interest Period
with respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan
in a Committed  Loan  Notice or if the  Borrower  fails to give a timely  notice
requesting a conversion or  continuation,  then the applicable  Committed  Loans
shall  be made as,  or  converted  to,  Base  Rate  Loans.  Any  such  automatic
conversion  to Base  Rate  Loans  shall be  effective  as of the last day of the
Interest  Period then in effect with respect to the applicable  Eurodollar  Rate
Loans. If the Borrower  requests a Borrowing of,  conversion to, or continuation
of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify
an Interest  Period,  it will be deemed to have specified an Interest  Period of
one month.

     (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative  Agent
shall  promptly  notify  each  Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable  Committed  Loans,  and  if  no  timely  notice  of a  conversion  or
continuation is provided by the Borrower,  the Administrative Agent shall notify
each  Lender of the  details  of any  automatic  conversion  to Base Rate  Loans
described in the  preceding  subsection.  In the case of a Committed  Borrowing,
each  Lender  shall  make the  amount of its  Committed  Loan  available  to the
Administrative  Agent  in  immediately  available  funds  at the  Administrative
Agent's  Office not later than 12:00 p.m. on the Business  Day  specified in the
applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set  forth in  Section  4.02  (and,  if such  Borrowing  is the  initial  Credit
Extension,  Section  4.01),  the  Administrative  Agent  shall make all funds so
received   available   to  the  Borrower  in  like  funds  as  received  by  the
Administrative  Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire  transfer of
such  funds,  in each case in  accordance  with  instructions  provided  to (and
reasonably  acceptable to) the Administrative  Agent by the Borrower;  provided,
however,  that if, on the date the  Committed  Loan Notice with  respect to such
Borrowing is given by the Borrower,  there are L/C Borrowings outstanding,  then
the proceeds of such Borrowing  shall be applied,  first, to the payment in full
of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, to the Borrower as provided above.

     (c) Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan may be
continued  or  converted  only on the last day of an  Interest  Period  for such
Eurodollar  Rate  Loan.  During  the  existence  of a  Default,  no Loans may be
requested  as,  converted to or continued as  Eurodollar  Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders.

     (d) The  Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the interest rate  applicable to any Interest  Period for  Eurodollar
Rate Loans upon  determination  of such interest rate. The  determination of the
Eurodollar Rate by the  Administrative  Agent shall be conclusive in the absence
of  manifest  error.  At any time  that Base Rate  Loans  are  outstanding,  the
Administrative  Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in
Bank of  America's  prime  rate  used in  determining  the  Base  Rate  promptly
following the public announcement of such change.

     (e) After giving effect to all Committed  Borrowings,  all  conversions  of
Committed Loans from one Type to the other,  and all  continuations of Committed
Loans as the same Type,  there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest  Periods
in effect with respect to Committed Loans.

     Credit  previously  issued by it, in accordance  with subsection (b) below,
     and (2) to honor  drafts  under the Letters of Credit;  and (B) the Lenders
     severally  agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account
     of the  Borrower;  provided  that the L/C Issuer  shall not be obligated to
     make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit,  and no
     Lender shall be obligated to  participate  in any Letter of Credit if as of
     the date of such L/C Credit  Extension,  (x) the Total  Outstandings  would
     exceed the Aggregate  Commitments,  (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
     the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     Outstanding  Amount  of all L/C  Obligations  would  exceed  such  Lender's
     Commitment,  or (z) the  Outstanding  Amount of the L/C  Obligations  would
     exceed the Letter of Credit  Sublimit.  Within the  foregoing  limits,  and
     subject  to the terms and  conditions  hereof,  the  Borrower's  ability to
     obtain  Letters of Credit shall be fully  revolving,  and  accordingly  the
     Borrower may,  during the  foregoing  period,  obtain  Letters of Credit to
     replace  Letters of Credit  that have  expired or that have been drawn upon
     and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
     issued  pursuant  hereto,  and from and after  the  Closing  Date  shall be
     subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

          (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no  obligation  to issue any Letter
     of Credit if:

               (A) any order,  judgment or decree of any Governmental  Authority
          or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C
          Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit,  or any Law  applicable  to
          the L/C Issuer or any request or directive  (whether or not having the
          force of law) from any Governmental  Authority with  jurisdiction over
          the L/C Issuer shall prohibit,  or request that the L/C Issuer refrain
          from,  the  issuance of letters of credit  generally or such Letter of
          Credit in  particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect
          to  such  Letter  of  Credit  any  restriction,   reserve  or  capital
          requirement  (for  which the L/C Issuer is not  otherwise  compensated
          hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
          L/C  Issuer  any  unreimbursed  loss,  cost or  expense  which was not
          applicable  on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith
          deems material to it;


                                       21
<PAGE>

               (B)  subject to  Section  2.03(b)(iii),  the expiry  date of such
          requested  Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve  months after
          the date of issuance or last renewal, unless the Required Lenders have
          approved such expiry date;

               (C) the  expiry  date of such  requested  Letter of Credit  would
          occur  after the  Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date,  unless  all the
          Lenders have approved such expiry date;

               (D) the  issuance of such Letter of Credit  would  violate one or
          more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

               (E) such  Letter  of  Credit is in an  initial  amount  less than
          $10,000,  in the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $10,000, in
          the case of a standby  Letter of Credit,  or is to be denominated in a
          currency other than Dollars.

          (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no  obligation to amend any Letter
     of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer  would have no  obligation  at such time to
     issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof,  or
     (B) the  beneficiary  of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed
     amendment to such Letter of Credit.

     (b)   Procedures   for  Issuance  and   Amendment  of  Letters  of  Credit;
Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.

          (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended,  as the case may
     be, upon the request of the  Borrower  delivered  to the L/C Issuer (with a
     copy to the  Administrative  Agent)  in the  form  of a  Letter  of  Credit
     Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
     the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
     Issuer and the Administrative  Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two
     Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a
     particular  instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance
     date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for
     an  initial  issuance  of  a  Letter  of  Credit,  such  Letter  of  Credit
     Application  shall  specify  in form  and  detail  satisfactory  to the L/C
     Issuer:  (A) the proposed  issuance date of the requested  Letter of Credit
     (which shall be a Business  Day);  (B) the amount  thereof;  (C) the expiry
     date thereof;  (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the
     documents  to be  presented  by such  beneficiary  in  case of any  drawing
     thereunder;  (F) the full text of any  certificate  to be presented by such
     beneficiary in case of any drawing  thereunder;  and (G) such other matters
     as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of
     any outstanding  Letter of Credit,  such Letter of Credit Application shall
     specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of
     Credit to be amended;  (B) the proposed  date of amendment  thereof  (which
     shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D)
     such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.

          (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit  Application,  the
     L/C Issuer will confirm with the  Administrative  Agent (by telephone or in
     writing) that the  Administrative  Agent has received a copy of such Letter
     of Credit  Application  from the Borrower  and, if not, the L/C Issuer will


                                       22
<PAGE>

     provide the Administrative  Agent with a copy thereof.  Upon receipt by the
     L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested
     issuance or amendment is permitted  in  accordance  with the terms  hereof,
     then,  subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on
     the  requested  date,  issue a Letter  of  Credit  for the  account  of the
     Borrower  or enter into the  applicable  amendment,  as the case may be, in
     each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary  business
     practices.  Immediately  upon the  issuance of each Letter of Credit,  each
     Lender  shall be deemed  to,  and hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally
     agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter
     of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
     times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

          (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any  applicable  Letter of Credit
     Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree
     to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an
     "Auto-Renewal  Letter  of  Credit");  provided  that any such  Auto-Renewal
     Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such  renewal at
     least  once  in each  twelve-month  period  (commencing  with  the  date of
     issuance  of  such  Letter  of  Credit)  by  giving  prior  notice  to  the
     beneficiary  thereof not later than a Business Day (the "Nonrenewal  Notice
     Date") in each such twelve-month  period to be agreed upon at the time such
     Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless  otherwise  directed by the L/C Issuer,
     the  Borrower  shall not be required to make a specific  request to the L/C
     Issuer for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been
     issued,  the  Lenders  shall  be  deemed  to have  authorized  (but may not
     require)  the L/C Issuer to permit the  renewal of such Letter of Credit at
     any time to an expiry  date not later than the Letter of Credit  Expiration
     Date;  provided,  however,  that the L/C  Issuer  shall not permit any such
     renewal  if (A)  the L/C  Issuer  has  determined  that  it  would  have no
     obligation  at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form
     under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section  2.03(a)(ii)
     or otherwise),  or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or
     in  writing)  on or before  the day that is two  Business  Days  before the
     Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the Administrative  Agent that the Required
     Lenders   have  elected  not  to  permit  such  renewal  or  (2)  from  the
     Administrative  Agent,  any Lender or the Borrower  that one or more of the
     applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied.

          (iv)  Promptly  after  its  delivery  of any  Letter  of Credit or any
     amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or
     to the  beneficiary  thereof,  the L/C  Issuer  will  also  deliver  to the
     Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent a true and  complete  copy of such
     Letter of Credit or amendment.

     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

          (i) Upon receipt from the  beneficiary  of any Letter of Credit of any
     notice of a drawing in compliance with the  requirements  under such Letter
     of Credit,  the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative
     Agent  thereof.  Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the
     L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"),  the
     Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in
     an  amount  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  drawing,  provided  that  the
     Administrative  Agent has provided  notice to the  Borrower  prior to 11:00
     a.m.  on such day that such  payment is due.  In the event  such  notice is


                                       23
<PAGE>

     received  after 11:00 a.m. on a Business Day, such payment shall be due not
     later than 11:00 a.m. on the next succeeding  Business Day. If the Borrower
     fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent
     shall  promptly  notify each  Lender of the Honor  Date,  the amount of the
     unreimbursed  drawing (the "Unreimbursed  Amount"),  and the amount of such
     Lender's  Pro Rata Share  thereof.  In such event,  the  Borrower  shall be
     deemed to have  requested  a Committed  Borrowing  of Base Rate Loans to be
     disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed  Amount,
     without  regard to the minimum and multiples  specified in Section 2.02 for
     the principal  amount of Base Rate Loans,  but subject to the amount of the
     unutilized  portion of the Aggregate  Commitments  and the  conditions  set
     forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed  Loan Notice)
     and the delivery of prior notice of such request for a Committed  Borrowing
     to the Borrower.  Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the  Administrative
     Agent  pursuant to this  Section  2.03(c)(i)  may be given by  telephone if
     immediately  confirmed  in  writing;  provided  that  the  lack  of such an
     immediate  confirmation  shall not  affect  the  conclusiveness  or binding
     effect of such notice.

          (ii) Each Lender  (including  the Lender  acting as L/C Issuer)  shall
     upon any notice pursuant to Section  2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the
     Administrative   Agent  for  the   account   of  the  L/C   Issuer  at  the
     Administrative  Agent's  Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of
     the  Unreimbursed  Amount not later than 12:00  p.m.  on the  Business  Day
     specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to
     the  provisions  of Section  2.03(c)(iii),  each Lender that so makes funds
     available  shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate  Committed  Loan to the
     Borrower in such amount. The Administrative  Agent shall remit the funds so
     received to the L/C Issuer.

          (iii)  With  respect  to any  Unreimbursed  Amount  that is not  fully
     refinanced  by a  Committed  Borrowing  of  Base  Rate  Loans  because  the
     conditions  set forth in Section  4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other
     reason,  the Borrower  shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer
     an L/C  Borrowing in the amount of the  Unreimbursed  Amount that is not so
     refinanced,  which  L/C  Borrowing  shall  be due  and  payable  on  demand
     (together  with  interest)  and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In
     such  event,  each  Lender's  payment to the  Administrative  Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section  2.03(c)(ii)  shall be deemed
     payment in respect of its  participation  in such L/C  Borrowing  and shall
     constitute  an  L/C  Advance  from  such  Lender  in  satisfaction  of  its
     participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

          (iv)  Until  each  Lender  funds  its  Committed  Loan or L/C  Advance
     pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount
     drawn under any Letter of Credit,  interest in respect of such Lender's Pro
     Rata  Share of such  amount  shall be  solely  for the  account  of the L/C
     Issuer.

          (v)  Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary,  each
     Lender's  obligation to make  Committed  Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse
     the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit,  as  contemplated
     by this Section 2.03(c),  shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
     be affected by any circumstance,  including (A) any set-off,  counterclaim,
     recoupment,  defense or other right which such Lender may have  against the


                                       24
<PAGE>

     L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B)
     the occurrence or continuance  of a Default,  or (C) any other  occurrence,
     event  or  condition,  whether  or not  similar  to  any of the  foregoing;
     provided,  however,  that each Lender's  obligation to make Committed Loans
     pursuant to this Section  2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in
     Section  4.02 (other  than  delivery  by the  Borrower of a Committed  Loan
     Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair
     the  obligation  of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount
     of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit,  together
     with interest as provided herein.

          (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent
     for the  account of the L/C Issuer any amount  required  to be paid by such
     Lender pursuant to the foregoing  provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the
     time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii),  the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to
     recover from such Lender  (acting  through the  Administrative  Agent),  on
     demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
     payment  is  required  to the date on which  such  payment  is  immediately
     available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal  Funds
     Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted
     to any  Lender  (through  the  Administrative  Agent)  with  respect to any
     amounts  owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive  absent  manifest
     error.

     (d) Repayment of Participations.

          (i) At any time  after the L/C  Issuer  has made a  payment  under any
     Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance
     in respect of such  payment in  accordance  with  Section  2.03(c),  if the
     Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment
     in respect of the related  Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether
     directly  from  the  Borrower  or  otherwise,  including  proceeds  of Cash
     Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative
     Agent  will   distribute   to  such  Lender  its  Pro  Rata  Share  thereof
     (appropriately  adjusted,  in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
     period of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was  outstanding)  in
     the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

          (ii) If any  payment  received  by the  Administrative  Agent  for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section  2.03(c)(i) is required to be
     returned  under  any  of  the  circumstances  described  in  Section  10.06
     (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its
     discretion),  each  Lender  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the
     account  of the L/C  Issuer  its Pro Rata  Share  thereof  on demand of the
     Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to
     the date such amount is returned by such Lender,  at a rate per annum equal
     to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

     (e) Obligations  Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
L/C Issuer for each  drawing  under each  Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C
Borrowing shall be absolute,  unconditional  and irrevocable,  and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including the following:


                                       25
<PAGE>

          (i) any lack of validity or  enforceability  of such Letter of Credit,
     this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (ii) the  existence of any claim,  counterclaim,  set-off,  defense or
     other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any  beneficiary
     or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
     beneficiary or any such  transferee  may be acting),  the L/C Issuer or any
     other Person,  whether in connection with this Agreement,  the transactions
     contemplated  hereby  or by such  Letter  of  Credit  or any  agreement  or
     instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

          (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
     such  Letter  of  Credit  proving  to be  forged,  fraudulent,  invalid  or
     insufficient  in any  respect  or any  statement  therein  being  untrue or
     inaccurate  in any  respect;  or any loss or delay in the  transmission  or
     otherwise  of any document  required in order to make a drawing  under such
     Letter of Credit;

          (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against
     presentation  of a draft or certificate  that does not strictly comply with
     the terms of such Letter of Credit;  or any payment  made by the L/C Issuer
     under  such  Letter of Credit to any Person  purporting  to be a trustee in
     bankruptcy,  debtor-in-possession,  assignee for the benefit of  creditors,
     liquidator,  receiver  or  other  representative  of or  successor  to  any
     beneficiary  or any  transferee  of such  Letter of Credit,  including  any
     arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

          (v) any other  circumstance  or happening  whatsoever,  whether or not
     similar to any of the  foregoing,  including  any other  circumstance  that
     might otherwise  constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of, the
     Borrower.

     The  Borrower  shall  promptly  examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance  with  the  Borrower's  instructions  or other  irregularity,  the
Borrower  will  immediately  notify  the  L/C  Issuer.  The  Borrower  shall  be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

     (f) Role of L/C Issuer.  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying
any  drawing  under a  Letter  of  Credit,  the L/C  Issuer  shall  not have any
responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,  certificates
and  documents  expressly  required by the Letter of Credit) or to  ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such  document or the authority of
the Person  executing or delivering any such  document.  None of the L/C Issuer,
any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,  participants
or  assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action
taken or omitted in  connection  herewith at the request or with the approval of
the Lenders or the Required  Lenders,  as  applicable;  (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful  misconduct;  or (iii) the
due  execution,  effectiveness,  validity or  enforceability  of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application.  The
Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;  provided,  however,


                                       26
<PAGE>

that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,  preclude the Borrower's
pursuing  such rights and  remedies as it may have  against the  beneficiary  or
transferee  at law or under any other  agreement.  None of the L/C  Issuer,  any
Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents,  participants or
assignees  of the L/C  Issuer,  shall be  liable or  responsible  for any of the
matters  described  in clauses  (i) through  (v) of Section  2.03(e);  provided,
however,  that  anything in such  clauses to the contrary  notwithstanding,  the
Borrower  may have a claim  against  the L/C  Issuer,  and the L/C Issuer may be
liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to  consequential  or exemplary,  damages suffered by the Borrower which
the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful  misconduct or gross
negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
after  the  presentation  to  it  by  the  beneficiary  of  a  sight  draft  and
certificate(s)  strictly  complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit.  In furtherance  and not in limitation of the foregoing,  the L/C Issuer
may  accept  documents  that  appear  on  their  face  to be in  order,  without
responsibility   for  further   investigation,   regardless  of  any  notice  or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity  or  sufficiency  of  any  instrument   transferring  or  assigning  or
purporting  to  transfer  or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder  or  proceeds  thereof,  in whole or in part,  which  may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

     (g) Cash Collateral.  Upon the request of the Administrative  Agent, (i) if
the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial  drawing request under any Letter
of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C  Borrowing,  or (ii) if, as of
the Letter of Credit  Expiration  Date,  any Letter of Credit may for any reason
remain  outstanding  and  partially  or  wholly  undrawn,   the  Borrower  shall
immediately  Cash   Collateralize  the  then  Outstanding   Amount  of  all  L/C
Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding  Amount determined as of the
date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit  Expiration Date, as the case
may be). For purposes hereof,  "Cash  Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit
with or deliver to the  Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer
and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations,  cash or deposit account
balances  pursuant to  documentation  in form and substance  satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to
by the  Lenders).  Derivatives  of such term have  corresponding  meanings.  The
Borrower hereby grants to the  Administrative  Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders,  a security interest in all such cash,  deposit accounts
and all balances  therein and all  proceeds of the  foregoing.  Cash  collateral
shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of
America.

     (h)  Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless  otherwise  expressly agreed by
the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued [including any
such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit], (i) the rules of the
"International   Standby   Practices   1998"   published  by  the  Institute  of
International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
effect at the time of issuance)  shall apply to each  standby  Letter of Credit,
and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary  Credits,
as most recently published by the International  Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC")
at the time of issuance  (including the ICC decision published by the Commission
on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.


                                       27
<PAGE>

     (i) Letter of Credit  Fees.  The Borrower  shall pay to the  Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share (i) a
Letter  of  Credit  fee for  each  commercial  Letter  of  Credit  equal  to the
Applicable  Rate under the column  "Commercial  Letters of Credit"  for the then
applicable  pricing level, on a per annum basis,  times the daily maximum amount
available  to be drawn under such Letter of Credit  (whether or not such maximum
amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit),  provided,  however, that
the Letter of Credit fee shall be no less than $200 for each  commercial  Letter
of  Credit,  and (ii) a Letter of Credit fee for each  standby  Letter of Credit
equal to the Applicable  Rate under the column  "Applicable  Rate for Eurodollar
Rate Loans and Standby Letters of Credit" for the then applicable pricing level,
on a per annum basis, times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
such  Letter of Credit  (whether  or not such  maximum  amount is then in effect
under such Letter of Credit),  provided,  however, that the Letter of Credit fee
shall be no less than $350 for each  standby  Letter of Credit.  Such  letter of
credit fees shall be computed  on a quarterly  basis in arrears.  Such letter of
credit  fees shall be due and  payable on the last  Business  Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the issuance of such Letter of Credit,  on the Letter of Credit  Expiration Date
and thereafter on demand.  If there is any change in the Applicable  Rate during
any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed
and  multiplied by the  Applicable  Rate  separately for each period during such
quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

     (j) Fronting Fee and  Documentary  and  Processing  Charges  Payable to L/C
Issuer.  The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a
fronting fee with  respect to each Letter of Credit in the amounts  specified in
the Fee Letter.  Such  fronting  fee shall be  computed on a quarterly  basis in
arrears.  Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to
occur  after the  issuance  of such  Letter of  Credit,  on the Letter of Credit
Expiration  Date and thereafter on demand.  In addition,  the Borrower shall pay
directly  to the L/C  Issuer  for  its  own  account  the  individual  customary
issuance,   presentation,   amendment  and  other  processing  fees,  and  other
reasonable  standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of
credit as from time to time in effect.  Such  customary  fees and standard costs
and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

     (k)  Conflict  with  Letter  of  Credit  Application.  In the  event of any
conflict  between  the  terms  hereof  and the  terms of any  Letter  of  Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

     2.04 Intentionally Omitted.

     2.05 Prepayments.

     (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative  Agent, at any time
or from  time to time  voluntarily  prepay  Committed  Loans in whole or in part
without  premium or penalty;  provided  that (i) such notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior
to any  date of  prepayment  of  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  and (B) on the date of
prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans;  (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate
Loans  shall be in a  principal  amount of  $3,000,000  or a whole  multiple  of
$1,000,000 in excess  thereof;  and (iii) any  prepayment of Base Rate Committed
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000


                                       28
<PAGE>

in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof
then  outstanding.  Each such notice  shall  specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid.  The Administrative
Agent will promptly  notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice,  and
of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice
is given by the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  shall  make such  prepayment  and the
payment  amount  specified  in such notice  shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied
by all accrued interest thereon,  together with any additional  amounts required
pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed
Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

     (b) If for any  reason  the  Total  Outstandings  at any  time  exceed  the
Aggregate  Commitments  then in effect,  the Borrower shall  immediately  prepay
Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess;  provided,  however,  that the Borrower shall not be required to
Cash  Collateralize the L/C Obligations  pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) unless
after the  prepayment  in full of the  Committed  Loans  the Total  Outstandings
exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

     2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

     The Borrower may, upon notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  terminate the
Aggregate  Commitments,  or from time to time  permanently  reduce the Aggregate
Commitments;  provided  that  (i) any  such  notice  shall  be  received  by the
Administrative  Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.  five Business Days prior to the
date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an
aggregate  amount of  $10,000,000  or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof,  (iii)  the  Borrower  shall not  terminate  or  reduce  the  Aggregate
Commitments  if, after giving effect thereto and to any  concurrent  prepayments
hereunder,  the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate  Commitments,  and
(iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments,  the
Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments,  such
Sublimit  shall be  automatically  reduced  by the  amount of such  excess.  The
Administrative  Agent will  promptly  notify the  Lenders of any such  notice of
termination  or reduction of the  Aggregate  Commitments.  Any  reduction of the
Aggregate  Commitments  shall  be  applied  to the  Commitment  of  each  Lender
according to its Pro Rata Share. All commitment fees accrued until the effective
date  of any  termination  of the  Aggregate  Commitments  shall  be paid on the
effective date of such termination.

     2.07 Repayment of Loans.

     The Borrower  shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate
principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding on such date.

     2.08 Interest.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below,  (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Loan shall bear interest on the  outstanding  principal  amount thereof for
each Interest  Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar  Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan
shall  bear  interest  on the  outstanding  principal  amount  thereof  from the


                                       29
<PAGE>

applicable  borrowing  date at a rate per annum  equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate.

     (b) If any amount  payable by the Borrower  under any Loan  Document is not
paid when due  (without  regard to any  applicable  grace  periods),  whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest  at a  fluctuating  interest  rate per annum at all times  equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable  Laws.  Furthermore,
while any Event of Default exists and is continuing,  the  Administrative  Agent
may determine,  in its sole judgment,  that it is appropriate  that the Borrower
shall  pay  interest  on the  principal  amount of all  outstanding  Obligations
hereunder  at a  fluctuating  interest  rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  Laws.  Accrued and
unpaid  interest on past due amounts  (including  interest on past due interest)
shall be due and payable upon demand.

     (c)  Interest  on each Loan  shall be due and  payable  in  arrears on each
Interest  Payment  Date  applicable  thereto  and at such other  times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the  terms  hereof  before  and  after  judgment,   and  before  and  after  the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

     2.09 Fees.

     In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of Section
2.03:

     (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative  Agent for
the account of each Lender in accordance  with its Pro Rata Share,  a commitment
fee equal to the  Applicable  Rate  times the actual  daily  amount by which the
Aggregate  Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Committed
Loans and (ii) the  Outstanding  Amount of L/C  Obligations.  The commitment fee
shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period,  including at any time
during which one or more of the  conditions  in Article IV is not met, and shall
be due and payable  quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the  Closing  Date,  and on the  Maturity  Date.  The  commitment  fee  shall be
calculated  quarterly in arrears,  and if there is any change in the  Applicable
Rate  during  any  quarter,  the  actual  daily  amount  shall be  computed  and
multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter
that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

     (b)  Other  Fees.  (i)  The  Borrower  shall  pay to the  Arranger  and the
Administrative  Agent for their own respective  accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times  specified in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when
paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

     (ii) The  Borrower  shall pay to the  Lenders  such fees as shall have been
separately  agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
Such fees shall be fully  earned when paid and shall not be  refundable  for any
reason whatsoever.

     2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees.


                                       30
<PAGE>

     All  computations of (i) interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is
determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" and (ii) fees, shall be made on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.
All other  computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year
and actual  days  elapsed  (which  results in more  interest  being paid than if
computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for
the day on which  the Loan is made,  and  shall  not  accrue  on a Loan,  or any
portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall,  subject
to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.

     2.11 Evidence of Debt.

     (a) The Credit  Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or
more  accounts or records  maintained  by such Lender and by the  Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by
the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive  absent  manifest
error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower
and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in
doing so shall not,  however,  limit or otherwise  affect the  obligation of the
Borrower  hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In
the event of any conflict  between the accounts  and records  maintained  by any
Lender and the  accounts and records of the  Administrative  Agent in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest  error.  Upon the request of any Lender made  through
the Administrative  Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender
(through the  Administrative  Agent) a Note,  which shall evidence such Lender's
Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules
to its Note and  endorse  thereon  the date,  Type (if  applicable),  amount and
maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

     (b) In addition to the accounts and records  referred to in subsection (a),
each Lender and the  Administrative  Agent shall maintain in accordance with its
usual  practice  accounts or records  evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of  participations  in Letters of  Credit.  In the event of any  conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative  Agent and the
accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters,  the accounts and
records of the  Administrative  Agent  shall  control in the absence of manifest
error.

     2.12 Payments Generally.

     (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition
or deduction for any  counterclaim,  defense,  recoupment  or setoff.  Except as
otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  all payments by the Borrower  hereunder
shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the account of the  respective
Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the  Administrative  Agent's Office in
Dollars and in immediately  available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date
specified  herein.  The  Administrative  Agent will promptly  distribute to each
Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such
payment in like funds as received  by wire  transfer  to such  Lender's  Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative  Agent after 1:00 p.m. shall
be  deemed  received  on the next  succeeding  Business  Day and any  applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.


                                       31
<PAGE>

     (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day,  payment shall be made on the next following  Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing  interest or fees, as
the case may be.

     (c) Unless the  Borrower  or any Lender  has  notified  the  Administrative
Agent,  prior  to the  date  any  payment  is  required  to be made by it to the
Administrative  Agent hereunder,  that the Borrower or such Lender,  as the case
may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower or such  Lender,  as the case may be, has timely made such  payment and
may (but shall not be so required  to), in reliance  thereon,  make  available a
corresponding  amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that
such  payment was not in fact made to the  Administrative  Agent in  immediately
available funds, then:

          (i) if the  Borrower  failed to make such  payment,  each Lender shall
     forthwith on demand repay to the  Administrative  Agent the portion of such
     assumed  payment  that was made  available  to such  Lender in  immediately
     available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from
     and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative
     Agent  to  such   Lender  to  the  date  such   amount  is  repaid  to  the
     Administrative  Agent in immediately  available  funds at the Federal Funds
     Rate from time to time in effect; and

          (ii) if any Lender  failed to make such  payment,  such  Lender  shall
     forthwith on demand pay to the  Administrative  Agent the amount thereof in
     immediately  available funds, together with interest thereon for the period
     from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
     the  Borrower to the date such amount is  recovered  by the  Administrative
     Agent (the "Compensation  Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
     Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  If such Lender pays such amount to
     the  Administrative  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's
     Committed  Loan included in the applicable  Borrowing.  If such Lender does
     not pay such  amount  forthwith  upon  the  Administrative  Agent's  demand
     therefor,  the  Administrative  Agent may make a demand  therefor  upon the
     Borrower,  and the  Borrower  shall pay such  amount to the  Administrative
     Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate
     per  annum  equal  to the rate of  interest  applicable  to the  applicable
     Borrowing.  Nothing  herein  shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
     obligation  to fulfill its  Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
     Administrative  Agent or the  Borrower  may have  against  any  Lender as a
     result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

     A notice of the  Administrative  Agent to any Lender or the  Borrower  with
respect  to any amount  owing  under this  subsection  (c) shall be  conclusive,
absent manifest error.

     (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any
Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the  foregoing  provisions of this
Article  II,  and such  funds  are not made  available  to the  Borrower  by the
Administrative  Agent because the conditions to the applicable  Credit Extension
set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  return  such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.


                                       32
<PAGE>

     (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to
fund  participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure
of any Lender to make any Committed  Loan or to fund any such  participation  on
any  date  required  hereunder  shall  not  relieve  any  other  Lender  of  its
corresponding  obligation  to do  so on  such  date,  and  no  Lender  shall  be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan or
purchase its participation.

     (f) Nothing  herein  shall be deemed to  obligate  any Lender to obtain the
funds  for any  Loan in any  particular  place  or  manner  or to  constitute  a
representation  by any Lender that it has  obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

     2.13 Sharing of Payments.

     If, other than as expressly  provided  elsewhere  herein,  any Lender shall
obtain on account of the Committed  Loans made by it, or the  participations  in
L/C Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the  exercise of any right of set-off,  or  otherwise)  in excess of its ratable
share (or  other  share  contemplated  hereunder)  thereof,  such  Lender  shall
immediately (a) notify the  Administrative  Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase
from the other Lenders such  participations  in the Committed Loans made by them
and/or such  subparticipations  in the participations in L/C Obligations held by
them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing  Lender
to  share  the  excess  payment  in  respect  of such  Committed  Loans  or such
participations,  as the  case  may be,  pro rata  with  each of them;  provided,
however,  that  if all or any  portion  of such  excess  payment  is  thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section  10.06  (including  pursuant  to  any  settlement  entered  into  by the
purchasing  Lender in its  discretion),  such  purchase  shall to that extent be
rescinded  and each  other  Lender  shall  repay to the  purchasing  Lender  the
purchase  price paid  therefor,  together  with an amount  equal to such  paying
Lender's  ratable share  (according to the  proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying  Lender's  required  repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the  purchasing  Lender) of any  interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing  Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered,  without further
interest  thereon.   The  Borrower  agrees  that  any  Lender  so  purchasing  a
participation  from another Lender may, to the fullest extent  permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off,  but subject
to Section 10.09) with respect to such  participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct  creditor of the  Borrower in the amount of such  participation.
The  Administrative  Agent will keep  records  (which  shall be  conclusive  and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,
demands,  directions and other  communications under this Agreement with respect
to the  portion of the  Obligations  purchased  to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

     2.14 Extension of Maturity Date.

     (a) Not earlier  than 90 days prior to, nor later than 60 days prior to the
first and second  anniversary  dates (each an  "Extension  Option  Date") of the
Closing Date, the Borrower may, upon notice to the  Administrative  Agent (which


                                       33
<PAGE>

shall promptly notify the Lenders), request a one-year extension of the Maturity
Date then in effect.  Within 30 days of  delivery  of such  notice,  each Lender
shall  notify  the  Administrative  Agent  whether  or not it  consents  to such
extension  (which  consent may be given or withheld  in such  Lender's  sole and
absolute  discretion).  Any Lender not  responding  within the above time period
shall be deemed to have declined such extension.  The Administrative Agent shall
promptly  notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the  Lenders'  responses.  If a
Lender  declines,  or is deemed to have declined,  to consent to such extension,
(i) the  Borrower  may  replace  such  Lender in  compliance  with the terms and
conditions of Section 10.16,  or (ii) in the absence of such  replacement,  upon
the  withdrawal  of such  Lender,  the  Aggregate  Commitments  shall be reduced
permanently  by the amount of the  withdrawing  Lender's  Commitment and in such
case each remaining  Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate  Commitments shall
be adjusted to reflect its new Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Commitments.

     (b) The Maturity  Date shall be extended  only if Lenders  holding at least
51% of the then  existing  Aggregate  Commitments  (after  giving  effect to any
replacements  of Lenders  permitted  herein)  (the  "Consenting  Lenders")  have
consented thereto.  If so extended,  the then existing Maturity Date ("Extension
Effective  Date"), as to the Consenting  Lenders,  shall be extended to the same
date in the following year,  effective as of such immediate  anniversary date of
the Closing  Date.  The  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower  shall  promptly
confirm to the Lenders such  extension and the new Maturity Date. As a condition
precedent to such  extension,  the Borrower shall deliver to the  Administrative
Agent a  certificate  of each Loan Party  dated as of the  applicable  Extension
Option  Date (in  sufficient  copies for each  Lender)  signed by a  Responsible
Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions  adopted
by such Loan Party  approving or  consenting  to such  extension and (ii) in the
case of the Borrower,  certifying  that,  before and after giving effect to such
extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the
other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the applicable  Extension
Option  Date,  except to the extent  that such  representations  and  warranties
specifically  refer to an earlier  date, in which case they are true and correct
as of such earlier date,  and except that for purposes of this Section 2.14, the
representations  and warranties  contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section
5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements  furnished  pursuant
to subsections  (a) and (b),  respectively,  of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default
has  occurred and is  continuing.  Such  certificate  shall also be delivered by
Borrower to the  Administrative  Agent on each  Extension  Effective  Date as an
additional condition precedent to each such extension. The Borrower shall prepay
any Committed  Loans  outstanding  on the Extension  Effective Date (and pay any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to
keep  outstanding  Committed  Loans  ratable  with any  revised and new Pro Rata
Shares of all the Lenders effective as of the Extension Effective Date.

     (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to
the contrary.

     2.15 Increase in Commitments.

     (a) Provided no Default has occurred and is continuing,  upon notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may
make not more than two requests for an increase in the Aggregate  Commitments by
an aggregate amount not exceeding $25,000,000,  which notice shall set forth the


                                       34
<PAGE>

amount of such  increase.  At the time of sending such notice,  the Borrower (in
consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within
which each Lender is requested to respond  (which shall in no event be less than
ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Each
Lender shall notify the Administrative  Agent in writing within such time period
whether or not it agrees to increase its  Commitment  and, if so,  whether by an
amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested
increase  ("Increasing  Lender").  Any Lender not  responding  within  such time
period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its  Commitment.  Any Lender
which  declines to  increase  its  Commitment  shall not be entitled to any fees
attributable  and payable in  connection  with such  increase  in the  Aggregate
Commitments.  To achieve the full amount of a requested  increase,  the Borrower
may  invite  additional  lenders  approved  by the  Administrative  Agent in its
reasonable discretion to become Lenders (each a "New Lender"). Borrower and each
New Lender shall have executed and delivered to the  Administrative  Agent a New
Lender  Agreement  (the "New  Lender  Agreement")  substantially  in the form of
Exhibit H and the Administrative Agent shall have accepted, and if acceptable in
its  reasonable  discretion,  shall have executed  same. In the event the entire
amount of the  requested  increase is greater than the new Loans the New Lenders
and  Increasing  Lenders  are willing to make  Borrower  may elect to accept the
increase in the Aggregate  Commitments in such lesser amount.  In no event shall
Administrative  Agent  have any  obligation  to  ensure  that the  amount of the
requested  increase is provided by New Lenders or  Increasing  Lenders.  Any New
Lender which agrees to become a Lender under this  Agreement  for the purpose of
funding a portion of the increase in the Aggregate Commitments shall be entitled
to all rights and  burdened  by all  obligations  of the then  existing  Lenders
hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of
the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder.

     (b) If the Aggregate  Commitments  are  increased in  accordance  with this
Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective
date (the "Increase  Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase.
The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly provide written notice to the Borrower
and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase,  each Lender's new Pro
Rata Share and the Increase  Effective  Date.  As a condition  precedent to such
increase,  the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent a certificate
of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies
for each  Lender)  signed  by a  Responsible  Officer  of such  Loan  Party  (i)
certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or
consenting to such  increase,  and (ii) in the case of the Borrower,  certifying
that, before and after giving effect to such increase,  (A) the  representations
and warranties  contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and
correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such
representations  and warranties  specifically refer to an earlier date, in which
case they are true and  correct as of such  earlier  date,  and except  that for
purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations  and warranties  contained in
subsections  (a) and (b) of  Section  5.05  shall be deemed to refer to the most
recent statements  furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b),  respectively,
of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower
shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and
pay any  additional  amounts  required  pursuant to Section  3.05) to the extent
necessary to keep the  outstanding  Committed Loans ratable with any revised Pro
Rata Shares arising from any nonratable  increase in the Commitments  under this
Section.  Each New Lender and/or Increasing Lender shall enable Borrower to make
such  prepayment  by making  Loans to the  Borrower,  pursuant  to the terms and
conditions in Article II, in amounts  sufficient  upon the  application  of such
Loans by all New  Lenders and  Increasing  Lenders to the  outstanding  Loans to


                                       35
<PAGE>

cause the outstanding  principal balance owed to each Lender to be in compliance
with its new Pro Rata Share. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each New
Lender and/or each  Increasing  Lender to fund to the  Administrative  Agent the
Loans  required to be made pursuant to the  immediately  preceding  sentence for
application to the reduction of the outstanding Loans held by the other Lenders.
Such new Loans shall be Base Rate Loans, subject to the Borrower's ability under
Article II to convert  such Loans to  Eurodollar  Rate Loans after the  Increase
Effective Date.

     (c) Upon the Increase  Effective Date and funding of the Loans described in
Section  2.15(b),  each New Lender and/or  Increasing  Lender shall be deemed to
have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received, without recourse or
warranty,  an undivided  participation  in all outstanding  Letters of Credit in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

     (d) This Section shall  supersede any  provisions in Sections 2.13 or 10.01
to the contrary.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     3.01 Taxes.

     (a) Any and all  payments  by the  Borrower  to or for the  account  of the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender under any Loan  Document  shall be made free
and clear of and  without  deduction  for any and all  present or future  taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions,  assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative  Agent and each  Lender,  taxes  imposed  on or  measured  by its
overall net income,  and  franchise  taxes  imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes),  by the  jurisdiction (or any political  subdivision  thereof) under the
Laws of which the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender,  as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such  non-excluded  taxes,  duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall
be  required  by any Laws to deduct  any  Taxes  from or in  respect  of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum  payable  shall be  increased  as  necessary  so that  after  making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section),  each of the Administrative  Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had no such  deductions  been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant  taxation  authority or other authority
in accordance  with  applicable  Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of
such  payment,  the Borrower  shall furnish to the  Administrative  Agent (which
shall  forward the same to such  Lender) the  original or a certified  copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof.

     (b) In addition,  the Borrower  agrees to pay any and all present or future
stamp,  court or  documentary  taxes and any other  excise or property  taxes or
charges or similar  levies  which  arise  from any  payment  made under any Loan
Document  or  from  the  execution,   delivery,   performance,   enforcement  or
registration  of, or otherwise  with respect to, any Loan Document  (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").


                                       36
<PAGE>

     (c) If the  Borrower  shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other
Taxes from or in  respect  of any sum  payable  under any Loan  Document  to the
Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender,  the  Borrower  shall  also  pay  to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such  additional  amount that the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax  yield (after  factoring in all
taxes,  including  taxes  imposed  on  or  measured  by  net  income)  that  the
Administrative  Agent or such Lender would have  received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

     (d) The Borrower  agrees to  indemnify  the  Administrative  Agent and each
Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes  (including any Taxes or
Other Taxes  imposed or asserted by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable under
this Section)  paid by the  Administrative  Agent and such Lender,  (ii) amounts
payable and incurred  under Section  3.01(c) and (iii) any liability  (including
additions to tax,  penalties,  interest and expenses)  arising therefrom or with
respect  thereto,  in each case  whether or not such  Taxes or Other  Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
Payment  under this  subsection  (d) shall be made within 30 days after the date
the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

     3.02 Illegality.

     If any Lender  determines  that any Law has made it  unlawful,  or that any
Governmental  Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,  for any Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to
determine or charge  interest  rates based upon the  Eurodollar  Rate,  then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative  Agent,
any  obligation of such Lender to make or continue  Eurodollar  Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate  Committed  Loans to Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall be suspended
until such Lender  notifies the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of
such notice,  the Borrower  shall,  upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate
Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans,  either on the last day of the Interest
Period  therefor,  if  such  Lender  may  lawfully  continue  to  maintain  such
Eurodollar  Rate  Loans to such day,  or  immediately,  if such  Lender  may not
lawfully  continue  to  maintain  such  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans.  Upon  any such
prepayment or conversion,  the Borrower  shall also pay accrued  interest on the
amount so prepaid or  converted.  Each  Lender  agrees to  designate a different
Lending Office if such  designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not,  in the  good  faith  judgment  of such  Lender,  otherwise  be  materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

     3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.

     If the  Required  Lenders  determine  that  for  any  reason  adequate  and
reasonable  means do not  exist  for  determining  the  Eurodollar  Rate for any
requested  Interest  Period with respect to a proposed  Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
that the  Eurodollar  Rate for any requested  Interest  Period with respect to a
proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding such Loan,  the  Administrative  Agent will  promptly so
notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter,  the obligation of the Lenders
to make  or  maintain  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  shall  be  suspended  until  the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request


                                       37
<PAGE>

for a Borrowing of,  conversion to or  continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     3.04  Increased  Cost and Reduced  Return;  Capital  Adequacy;  Reserves on
Eurodollar Rate Loans.

     (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any
change  in or in the  interpretation  of any Law,  or such  Lender's  compliance
therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to
make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may
be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit,  or a reduction in the amount
received or receivable  by such Lender in  connection  with any of the foregoing
(excluding  for  purposes of this  subsection  (a) any such  increased  costs or
reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section
3.01 shall govern),  (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income
or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign  jurisdiction or any
political  subdivision  of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is
organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated
by Section  3.04(c)),  then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a
copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction.

     (b) If any Lender  determines  that the  introduction  of any Law regarding
capital  adequacy or any change  therein or in the  interpretation  thereof,  or
compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office)  therewith,  has the effect of
reducing  the rate of return on the  capital of such  Lender or any  corporation
controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations  hereunder
(taking into  consideration  its policies  with respect to capital  adequacy and
such Lender's desired return on capital),  then from time to time upon demand of
such  Lender  (with a copy of such  demand  to the  Administrative  Agent),  the
Borrower  shall pay to such Lender such  additional  amounts as will  compensate
such Lender for such reduction.

     (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender,  as long as such Lender shall be
required to maintain  reserves with respect to liabilities or assets  consisting
of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency
liabilities"),  additional  interest  on the  unpaid  principal  amount  of each
Eurodollar  Rate Loan equal to the actual  costs of such  reserves  allocated to
such Loan by such Lender (as  determined  by such  Lender in good  faith,  which
determination shall be conclusive),  which shall be due and payable on each date
on which  interest is payable on such Loan,  provided  the  Borrower  shall have
received  at  least  15  days'  prior  written   notice  (with  a  copy  to  the
Administrative  Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender
fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant  Interest  Payment Date, such
additional  interest  shall be due and  payable  15 days  from  receipt  of such
notice.

     3.05 Funding Losses.

     Upon demand of any Lender  (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent) from
time to time, the Borrower shall  promptly  compensate  such Lender for and hold
such Lender harmless from any loss,  cost or expense  incurred by it as a result
of:


                                       38
<PAGE>

     (a) any continuation,  conversion,  payment or prepayment of any Loan other
than a Base Rate Loan on a day other  than the last day of the  Interest  Period
for  such  Loan  (whether  voluntary,   mandatory,   automatic,   by  reason  of
acceleration, or otherwise);

     (b) any  failure by the  Borrower  (for a reason  other than the failure of
such  Lender to make a Loan) to prepay,  borrow,  continue  or convert  any Loan
other  than a Base  Rate  Loan on the  date  or in the  amount  notified  by the
Borrower;

     (c) any  assignment of a Eurodollar  Rate Loan on a day other than the last
day of the  Interest  Period  therefor as a result of a request by the  Borrower
pursuant to Section 10.16; or

     (d) in addition to any similar obligations hereunder,  within 180 days from
the date hereof, any breakage costs,  charges or fees incurred with respect to a
Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  because  of the  syndication  of this  revolving  credit
facility.

The Borrower  shall also pay any customary and  reasonable  administrative  fees
charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section  3.05,  each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each  Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching  deposit
or other borrowing in the London  interbank  eurodollar  market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

     3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation.

     (a) A  certificate  of the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  claiming
compensation  under this Article III and setting forth the additional  amount or
amounts  to be paid to it  hereunder  shall  be  conclusive  in the  absence  of
manifest error. In determining  such amount,  the  Administrative  Agent or such
Lender  may  use  any  reasonable  averaging  and  attribution  methods.  At the
Borrower's  request,  such Lender shall provide to the Borrower such  supporting
information  related  to  such  claim  for  compensation  as may  reasonably  be
requested,  provided,  however,  that no Lender shall be required to provide any
information that it deems confidential.

     (b) Each Lender  agrees that, as promptly as  practicable  after it becomes
aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition  which would
entitle it to exercise any rights under  Sections 3.01 or Section 3.04, it shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain the affected Loans
of such Lender through  another lending office of such Lender if (a) as a result
thereof the  additional  moneys which would  otherwise be required to be paid in
respect of such Loans of such Lender would be reduced or the illegality or other
adverse  circumstances  which would  otherwise  affect such Loans of such Lender
would cease to exist or the increased cost which would  otherwise be required to
be paid in respect of such Loans would be reduced,  and (b) the making,  funding
or  maintaining  of such Loans  through  such  other  lending  office  would not
otherwise adversely affect such Loans or such Lender.

     (c) In the event  the  Borrower  becomes  obligated  to pay any  additional
amount to any Lender  pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section  3.04,  as a result of


                                       39
<PAGE>

any event or condition  described  in any of such  Sections,  then,  unless such
Lender has theretofore  taken steps to remove or cure, and has removed or cured,
the  conditions  creating the cause of such  obligation  to pay such  additional
amounts, Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.16.

     3.07 Survival.

     All of the  Borrower's  obligations  under this  Article III shall  survive
termination of the Aggregate  Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations
hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

Entertainment and each other Loan Party contained in Article V or any other Loan

Party,  enforceable  against each Loan Party that is party thereto in accordance
with its terms,  except as it is  hypothetically  affected  by (a) the effect of
bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  receivership,  moratorium,  or  other

Entertainment  or any of its  Subsidiaries or against any of their properties or

Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or to the ability
of the Borrower or CEC  Entertainment  and its  Subsidiaries or any Guarantor to
perform  their  respective  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  or (b)  either
individually  or in the  aggregate,  if  determined  adversely,  would likely be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Neither the Borrower nor CEC Entertainment nor any Subsidiary is in default

Entertainment,  nothing has occurred which would prevent,  or cause the loss of,
such qualification.  The Borrower and CEC Entertainment and each ERISA Affiliate
have made all required  contributions to each Plan subject to Section 412 of the

would  result  in such  liability)  under  Sections  4201 or 4243 of ERISA  with
respect  to  a  Multiemployer  Plan;  and  (v)  neither  the  Borrower  nor  CEC
Entertainment nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be

of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such
commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

     (b) declare  the unpaid  principal  amount of all  outstanding  Loans,  all
interest  accrued and unpaid  thereon,  and all other  amounts  owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan  Document to be  immediately  due and payable,
without presentment,  demand,  protest or other notice of any kind, all of which

proviso to Section  8.02),  any amounts  received on account of the  Obligations
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:


                                       60
<PAGE>

     First,  to payment of that portion of the  Obligations  constituting  fees,
indemnities,  expenses and other amounts  (including  Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the  Administrative  Agent in its capacity
as such;

     Second,  to payment of that portion of the Obligations  constituting  fees,
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the
Lenders  (including  Attorney  Costs and amounts  payable  under  Article  III),
ratably among them in proportion to the amounts  described in this clause Second
payable to them;

     Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations  constituting  accrued
and unpaid  interest on the Loans and L/C  Borrowings  and Swap Contracts of the

this clause Third payable to them;

     Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations  constituting  unpaid
principal  of the  Loans  and L/C  Borrowings,  ratably  among  the  Lenders  in

undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and

     Last,  the  balance,  if  any,  after  all of  the  Obligations  have  been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

Subject to Section  2.03(c),  amounts used to Cash  Collateralize  the aggregate
undrawn  amount of Letters of Credit  pursuant  to clause  Fifth  above shall be
applied to satisfy  drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.  If any
amount  remains on deposit as Cash  Collateral  after all Letters of Credit have

the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

                        ARTICLE IX. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     9.01 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.

     (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints,  designates and authorizes the
Administrative  Agent to take such action on its behalf under the  provisions of
this  Agreement  and each other Loan  Document  and to exercise  such powers and
perform  such  duties  as are  expressly  delegated  to it by the  terms of this
Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document,  together  with  such  powers  as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto.  Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary
contained  elsewhere  herein or in any other Loan Document,  the  Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,  except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the  Administrative  Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions,  responsibilities,  duties,  obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document or otherwise  exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the  use of the  term  "agent"  herein  and in the  other  Loan  Documents  with


                                       61
<PAGE>

reference to the  Administrative  Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express)  obligations  arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead,  such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

     (b) The L/C Issuer  shall act on behalf of the Lenders  with respect to any
Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated  therewith,  and the
L/C Issuer  shall have all of the benefits  and  immunities  (i) provided to the
Administrative  Agent in this  Article  IX with  respect  to any  acts  taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the  applications  and  agreements  for
letters of credit  pertaining  to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative  Agent"  as used in this  Article  IX and in the  definition  of
"Agent-Related  Person"  included  the L/C Issuer  with  respect to such acts or
omissions,  and (ii) as  additionally  provided  herein with  respect to the L/C
Issuer.

     9.02 Delegation of Duties.

     The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document by or through agents,  employees or attorneys-in-fact
and shall be  entitled  to advice of counsel  and other  consultants  or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not  be   responsible   for  the  negligence  or  misconduct  of  any  agent  or
attorney-in-fact  that it selects in the absence of gross  negligence or willful
misconduct.

     9.03 Liability of Administrative Agent.

     No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them under or in  connection  with this  Agreement  or any
other Loan Document or the transactions  contemplated hereby (except for its own
gross  negligence or willful  misconduct in connection with its duties expressly
set  forth  herein),  or (b) be  responsible  in any  manner  to any  Lender  or
participant for any recital,  statement,  representation or warranty made by any
Loan  Party or any  officer  thereof,  contained  herein  or in any  other  Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or  provided  for in,  or  received  by the  Administrative  Agent  under  or in
connection  with,  this Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or the validity,
effectiveness,  genuineness,  enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party
to any Loan  Document to perform its  obligations  hereunder or  thereunder.  No
Agent-Related  Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the  observance  or  performance  of any of the
agreements  contained  in, or  conditions  of, this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document,  or to inspect the  properties,  books or records of any Loan Party or
any Affiliate thereof.

     9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

     (a) The Administrative  Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing,  communication,  signature,  resolution,
representation,  notice,  consent,  certificate,  affidavit,  letter,  telegram,


                                       62
<PAGE>

facsimile,  telex or telephone  message,  electronic mail message,  statement or
other document or  conversation  believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,  and upon advice
and  statements  of  legal  counsel  (including  counsel  to  any  Loan  Party),
independent  accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under any Loan Document  unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence  of the  Required  Lenders  as it deems  appropriate  and,  if it so
requests,  it shall  first be  indemnified  to its  satisfaction  by the Lenders
against any and all  liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative  Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,  under
this  Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document  in  accordance  with a request or
consent of the  Required  Lenders (or such  greater  number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

     (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in
Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented  to,  approved or accepted or to be satisfied  with,  each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received
notice  from such Lender  prior to the  proposed  Closing  Date  specifying  its
objection thereto.

     9.05 Notice of Default.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders,  unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
written  notice  from a Lender  or the  Borrower  referring  to this  Agreement,
describing  such  Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."
The  Administrative  Agent will  notify the  Lenders of its  receipt of any such
notice.  The  Administrative  Agent shall take such action with  respect to such
Default as may be directed by the Required  Lenders in  accordance  with Article
VIII;  provided,  however,  that unless and until the  Administrative  Agent has
received  any such  direction,  the  Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such  Default  as it shall  deem  advisable  or in the best  interest  of the
Lenders.

     9.06 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative Agent.

     Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  no  Agent-Related  Person  has  made  any
representation  or warranty to it, and that no act by the  Administrative  Agent
hereafter  taken,  including any consent to and  acceptance of any assignment or
review of the  affairs  of any Loan  Party or any  Affiliate  thereof,  shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related  Person
to any Lender as to any matter,  including  whether  Agent-Related  Persons have
disclosed  material  information in their possession.  Each Lender represents to
the  Administrative  Agent that it has,  independently and without reliance upon
any  Agent-Related  Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed  appropriate,  made  its own  appraisal  of and  investigation  into  the
business,  prospects,  operations,  property,  financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries,  and all


                                       63
<PAGE>

applicable  bank  or  other   regulatory  Laws  relating  to  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend  credit to the  Borrower and the other Loan  Parties  hereunder.  Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related  Person and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall
deem  appropriate  at the  time,  continue  to  make  its own  credit  analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents,  and to make such investigations as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, prospects,  operations, property, financial
and other  condition  and  creditworthiness  of the  Borrower and the other Loan
Parties.  Except for notices,  reports and other documents expressly required to
be  furnished  to  the  Lenders  by  the   Administrative   Agent  herein,   the
Administrative  Agent shall not have any duty or  responsibility  to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,  prospects,
operations,  property,  financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any
of the Loan Parties or any of their  respective  Affiliates  which may come into
the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

     9.07 Indemnification of Administrative Agent.

     Whether or not the transactions  contemplated  hereby are consummated,  the
Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation
of any Loan Party to do so),  pro rata,  and hold  harmless  each  Agent-Related
Person  from and  against any and all  Indemnified  Liabilities  incurred by it;
provided,  however,  that no  Lender  shall be  liable  for the  payment  to any
Agent-Related  Person of any  portion  of such  Indemnified  Liabilities  to the
extent  determined  in a final,  nonappealable  judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction  to have  resulted  from  such  Agent-Related  Person's  own  gross
negligence or willful  misconduct;  provided,  however,  that no action taken in
accordance  with the  directions  of the  Required  Lenders  shall be  deemed to
constitute gross negligence or willful  misconduct for purposes of this Section.
Without   limitation  of  the  foregoing,   each  Lender  shall   reimburse  the
Administrative  Agent  upon  demand  for  its  ratable  share  of any  costs  or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation,  execution, delivery,  administration,
modification,  amendment or enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal
proceedings  or  otherwise)  of,  or  legal  advice  in  respect  of  rights  or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated  by or  referred to herein,  to the extent that the  Administrative
Agent is not reimbursed  for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.  The
undertaking  in  this  Section  shall  survive   termination  of  the  Aggregate
Commitments,  the payment of all other  Obligations  and the  resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

     9.08 Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.

     Bank of America  and its  Affiliates  may make loans to,  issue  letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective  Affiliates
as though Bank of America  were not the  Administrative  Agent or the L/C Issuer
hereunder  and  without  notice  to or  consent  of  the  Lenders.  The  Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive  information  regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates  (including


                                       64
<PAGE>

information that may be subject to confidentiality  obligations in favor of such
Loan Party or such  Affiliate) and  acknowledge  that the  Administrative  Agent
shall be under no obligation to provide such  information to them.  With respect
to its Loans,  Bank of America  shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise  such rights and powers as though
it were not the  Administrative  Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender"
and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

     9.09 Successor Administrative Agent.

     The Administrative  Agent may resign as Administrative  Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Lenders;  provided  that any such  resignation  by Bank of America
shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer. If the Administrative Agent
resigns under this Agreement,  the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the
Lenders a  successor  administrative  agent  for the  Lenders,  which  successor
administrative  agent shall be  consented  to by the Borrower at all times other
than during the existence of an Event of Default  (which consent of the Borrower
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor  administrative
agent  is  appointed  prior  to the  effective  date of the  resignation  of the
Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent may appoint,  after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower,  a successor  administrative agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor  administrative
agent hereunder,  the Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall
succeed to all the  rights,  powers and  duties of the  retiring  Administrative
Agent and L/C Issuer and the respective  terms  "Administrative  Agent" and "L/C
Issuer"  shall  mean such  successor  administrative  agent and Letter of Credit
issuer and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as
Administrative  Agent shall be terminated and the retiring L/C Issuer's  rights,
powers and duties as such shall be terminated,  without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer or any other Lender,  other than
the  obligation  of the  successor  L/C  Issuer  to issue  letters  of credit in
substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,  outstanding at the time of such
succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer
to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to
such Letters of Credit.  After any retiring  Administrative  Agent's resignation
hereunder  as  Administrative  Agent,  the  provisions  of this  Article  IX and
Sections  10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or
omitted  to be  taken  by it  while  it  was  Administrative  Agent  under  this
Agreement.  If no successor  administrative  agent has accepted  appointment  as
Administrative  Agent  by  the  date  which  is 30  days  following  a  retiring
Administrative  Agent's  notice  of  resignation,  the  retiring  Administrative
Agent's  resignation  shall  nevertheless  thereupon  become  effective  and the
Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required  Lenders  appoint a successor  agent as
provided for above.

     9.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.

     In case  of the  pendency  of any  receivership,  insolvency,  liquidation,
bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,  composition  or  other
judicial  proceeding  relative  to any  Loan  Party,  the  Administrative  Agent
(irrespective  of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and  payable as herein  expressed  or by  declaration  or  otherwise  and
irrespective of whether the  Administrative  Agent shall have made any demand on
the  Borrower)  shall  be  entitled  and  empowered,  by  intervention  in  such
proceeding or otherwise


                                       65
<PAGE>

          (a) to file and prove a claim for the  whole  amount of the  principal
     and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans,  L/C Obligations and
     all other  Obligations  that are owing and  unpaid  and to file such  other
     documents  as may be  necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
     the  Lenders  and the  Administrative  Agent  (including  any claim for the
     reasonable  compensation,  expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  of  the
     Lenders  and the  Administrative  Agent and  their  respective  agents  and
     counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative  Agent
     under  Sections  2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 10.04)  allowed in such judicial
     proceeding; and

          (b) to collect  and receive  any monies or other  property  payable or
     deliverable  on any  such  claims  and to  distribute  the  same;

and any custodian,  receiver,  assignee,  trustee,  liquidator,  sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial  proceeding is hereby  authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative  Agent and, in the event
that the  Administrative  Agent  shall  consent to the  making of such  payments
directly to the Lenders,  to pay to the Administrative  Agent any amount due for
the  reasonable  compensation,  expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  of  the
Administrative  Agent and its agents and counsel,  and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.

     Nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to authorize the  Administrative
Agent to  authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of  reorganization,  arrangement,  adjustment or composition  affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

     9.11 Guaranty Matters.

     The Lenders irrevocably  authorize the Administrative  Agent, at its option
and in its discretion,  to release any Guarantor from its obligations  under the
Guaranty  if such  Person  ceases to be a  Required  Guarantor  as a result of a
transaction permitted hereunder.

     Upon request by the Administrative  Agent at any time, the Required Lenders
will  confirm in writing the  Administrative  Agent's  authority  to release any
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11.

     9.12 Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers.

     None of the  Lenders or other  Persons  identified  on the  facing  page or
signature  pages of this  Agreement  as a  "syndication  agent,"  "documentation
agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead manager,"  "arranger," "lead arranger"
or  "co-arranger"   shall  have  any  right,   power,   obligation,   liability,
responsibility  or duty under this  Agreement  other  than,  in the case of such
Lenders,  those  applicable  to  all  Lenders  as  such.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified  shall have or be
deemed  to  have  any  fiduciary  relationship  with  any  Lender.  Each  Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or
other  Persons so  identified  in  deciding to enter into this  Agreement  or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

     No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document,  and no consent to any  departure  by the  Borrower  or any other Loan
Party  therefrom,  shall be effective  unless in writing  signed by the Required
Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable  Loan Party,  as the case may be, and
acknowledged by the Administrative  Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall
be  effective  only in the specific  instance  and for the specific  purpose for

other Loan Document,  or change the manner of computation of any financial ratio
(including  any change in any applicable  defined term) used in determining  the
Applicable  Rate that would result in a reduction  of any  interest  rate on any
Loan or any fee payable  hereunder  without  the written  consent of each Lender
directly  affected  thereby;  provided,  however,  that only the  consent of the
Required  Lenders  shall be  necessary to (i) amend the  definition  of "Default

of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment,  waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the Administrative  Agent in addition to the Lenders required above,  affect the

thereunder   waived,  in  a  writing  executed  only  by  the  parties  thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,  waiver or consent  hereunder,
except  that the  Commitment  of such  Lender may not be  increased  or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

     electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its Administrative
     Questionnaire or to such other address,  facsimile number,  electronic mail
     address  or  telephone  number as shall be  designated  by such  party in a
     notice to the Borrower, CEC Entertainment, the Administrative Agent and the
     L/C Issuer.

All such  notices and other  communications  shall be deemed to be given or made

     (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents may
be  transmitted  and/or  signed  by  facsimile.  The  effectiveness  of any such
documents and signatures  shall,  subject to applicable Law, have the same force
and  effect  as  manually-signed  originals  and  shall be  binding  on all Loan
Parties,  the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may


                                       68
<PAGE>

also  require  that  any  such  documents  and  signatures  be  confirmed  by  a
manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile  document
or signature.

     (c)  Limited Use of  Electronic  Mail.  Electronic  mail and  Internet  and
intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as
financial  statements and other  information as provided in Section 6.02, and to

were  incomplete  or were not  preceded  or followed by any other form of notice
specified  herein,  or (ii) the terms  thereof,  as understood by the recipient,
varied  from  any  confirmation  thereof.  The  Borrower  shall  indemnify  each
Agent-Related  Person and each  Lender  from all  losses,  costs,  expenses  and
liabilities   resulting  from  the  reliance  by  such  Person  on  each  notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and
other  communications  with the  Administrative  Agent  may be  recorded  by the
Administrative  Agent,  and each of the parties  hereto hereby  consents to such
recording.

     10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

     No failure by any Lender or the  Administrative  Agent to exercise,  and no
delay by any such Person in exercising,  any right,  remedy,  power or privilege
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right,  remedy,  power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.  The rights,  remedies,  powers and  privileges  herein  provided are
cumulative  and not  exclusive of any rights,  remedies,  powers and  privileges
provided  by law.  The  Borrower  shall not be deemed to have  waived any right,
remedy, power or privilege unless such waiver is in writing.

     10.04 Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes.

     The Borrower  agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the  Administrative  Agent for
all reasonable  costs and expenses  incurred in connection with the development,
preparation,  negotiation  and  execution of this  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents  and any  amendment,  waiver,  consent  or other  modification  of the
provisions  hereof and  thereof  (whether or not the  transactions  contemplated
hereby or thereby are consummated),  and the consummation and  administration of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,  including all Attorney Costs,
and (b) to pay or  reimburse  the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender for all
costs and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with the  enforcement,  attempted
enforcement,  or  preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents  (including all such costs and expenses incurred during
any  "workout" or  restructuring  in respect of the  Obligations  and during any
legal  proceeding,  including  any  proceeding  under any  Debtor  Relief  Law),
including all Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all
search,  filing,  recording,  title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and
taxes  related  thereto,  and  other  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the
Administrative  Agent and the cost of independent  public  accountants and other
outside experts retained by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender. All amounts


                                       69
<PAGE>

due under this Section  10.04 shall be payable  within ten  Business  Days after
demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of
the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

     10.05 Indemnification by the Borrower.

     Whether or not the transactions  contemplated  hereby are consummated,  the
Borrower  shall  indemnify  and hold harmless each  Agent-Related  Person,  each

any  and all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  claims,
demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including
Attorney  Costs)  of any  kind or  nature  whatsoever  which  may at any time be
imposed  on,  incurred by or asserted  against  any such  Indemnitee  in any way
relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery,
enforcement,  performance  or  administration  of any Loan Document or any other
agreement,  letter or instrument  delivered in connection with the  transactions
contemplated  thereby  or  the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
thereby, (b) any Commitment, Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use
of the proceeds  therefrom  (including  any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a
demand  for  payment  under a Letter  of Credit if the  documents  presented  in
connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit), (c) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower,
any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or any  Environmental  Liability related
in any way to the Borrower,  any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party,  or (d) any
actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the  foregoing,  whether  based on  contract,  tort or any  other  theory
(including any investigation  of,  preparation for, or defense of any pending or
threatened  claim,  investigation,  litigation or proceeding)  and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing,  collectively, the
"Indemnified  Liabilities"),  in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising,
in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee,  be available to the extent that such
liabilities,  obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Indemnitee.  No Indemnitee
shall  be  liable  for  any  damages  arising  from  the  use by  others  of any
information  or other  materials  obtained  through  IntraLinks or other similar
information  transmission  systems in connection with this Agreement,  nor shall
any  Indemnitee  have any  liability for any indirect or  consequential  damages
relating  to this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or arising out of its
activities  in  connection  herewith or therewith  (whether  before or after the
Closing Date).  All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable within
ten Business Days after demand  therefor.  The  agreements in this Section shall
survive the  resignation of the  Administrative  Agent,  the  replacement of any
Lender,  the  termination  of  the  Aggregate  Commitments  and  the  repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

     10.06 Payments Set Aside.

     To the extent that any  payment by or on behalf of the  Borrower is made to
the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender,  or the  Administrative  Agent or any


                                       70
<PAGE>

Lender exercises its right of set-off,  and such payment or the proceeds of such
set-off  or  any  part  thereof  is  subsequently  invalidated,  declared  to be
fraudulent or  preferential,  set aside or required  (including  pursuant to any
settlement  entered  into by the  Administrative  Agent  or such  Lender  in its
discretion)  to be  repaid  to a  trustee,  receiver  or  any  other  party,  in
connection  with any proceeding  under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise,  then
(a) to the extent of such recovery,  the  obligation or part thereof  originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not  occurred,  and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent upon demand its
applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent,  plus  interest  thereon  from the date of such  demand  to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect.

     10.07 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit  of the  parties  hereto and their  respective  successors  and  assigns
permitted hereby,  except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations  hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise  transfer any of its rights or
obligations  hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section,  (ii) by way of  participation  in
accordance  with the provisions of subsection  (d) of this Section,  or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security  interest  subject to the restrictions
of  subsection  (f) of this  Section  (and any  other  attempted  assignment  or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied,  shall be construed to confer upon any Person  (other than
the parties hereto,  their respective  successors and assigns  permitted hereby,
Participants  to the extent  provided in subsection  (d) of this Section and, to
the  extent  expressly  contemplated  hereby,  the  Indemnitees)  any  legal  or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all
or a portion of its rights and obligations  under this Agreement  (including all
or a portion of its  Commitment  and the Loans  (including  for purposes of this
subsection  (b),  participations  in L/C  Obligations) at the time owing to it);
provided that (i) except in the case of an  assignment  of the entire  remaining
amount of the assigning  Lender's  Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund (as defined in  subsection  (g) of this Section) with respect to a
Lender,  the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes
Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment,  determined as of
the date the  Assignment  and  Assumption  with  respect to such  assignment  is
delivered  to the  Administrative  Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the
Assignment  and  Assumption,  as of the  Trade  Date,  shall  not be  less  than
$5,000,000 unless each of the  Administrative  Agent and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Borrower  otherwise  consents (each
such  consent not to be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed);  (ii) each partial
assignment  shall be made as an  assignment of a  proportionate  part of all the
assigning  Lender's rights and obligations  under this Agreement with respect to
the Loans or the Commitment assigned;  (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must
be approved  by the  Administrative  Agent and the L/C Issuer  unless the Person
that is the  proposed  assignee is itself a Lender  (whether or not the proposed
assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee);  and (iv) the parties


                                       71
<PAGE>

to each  assignment  shall  execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent an
Assignment and  Assumption,  together with a processing and  recordation  fee of
$3,500.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection  (c) of this Section,  from and after the effective  date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption,  the Eligible  Assignee  thereunder
shall be a party to this Agreement  and, to the extent of the interest  assigned
by such Assignment and  Assumption,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement,  and the assigning Lender  thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Assumption  covering all of the assigning  Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections  3.01,  3.04,  3.05,  10.04 and 10.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment).  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  that does not  comply  with this
subsection  shall be treated for  purposes of this  Agreement  as a sale by such
Lender of a  participation  in such rights and  obligations  in accordance  with
subsection (d) of this Section.

     (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption  delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the  Commitments  of, and principal
amounts of the Loans and L/C  Obligations  owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms  hereof from time to time (the  "Register").  The entries in the  Register
shall be conclusive,  and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person  whose name is recorded  in the  Register  pursuant to the
terms  hereof  as a  Lender  hereunder  for  all  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
notwithstanding  notice to the  contrary.  The Register  shall be available  for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender,  at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (d) Any Lender may at any time,  without  the consent of, or notice to, the
Borrower or the Administrative  Agent, sell  participations to any Person (other
than a  natural  person  or the  Borrower  or  CEC  Entertainment  or any of CEC
Entertainment's  Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a
portion  of  such  Lender's  rights  and/or  obligations  under  this  Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment  and/or the Loans  (including such
Lender's participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's  obligations  under this Agreement  shall remain  unchanged,  (ii) such
Lender shall  remain  solely  responsible  to the other  parties  hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other  Lenders  shall  continue  to deal solely and  directly  with such
Lender in  connection  with such  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under this
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument  pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall  retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,  modification  or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement;  provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section,  the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 3.01,  3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a


                                       72
<PAGE>

Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section.  To the extent  permitted by law, each  Participant  also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section  10.09 as though it were a Lender,  provided
such  Participant  agrees  to be  subject  to  Section  2.13 as though it were a
Lender.

     (e) A  Participant  shall not be entitled  to receive  any greater  payment
under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the  applicable  Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation  sold to such  Participant,  unless
the sale of the  participation  to such  Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower
is notified of the  participation  sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower,  to comply with Section 10.15 as though
it were a Lender.

     (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement  (including under its Note, if
any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
secure  obligations to a Federal  Reserve Bank;  provided that no such pledge or
assignment  shall release such Lender from any of its  obligations  hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     (g) As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

          "Eligible  Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender;
     (c) an  Approved  Fund;  and (d) any  other  Person  (other  than a natural
     person) approved by (i) the  Administrative  Agent and the L/C Issuer,  and
     (ii)  unless  an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the
     Borrower (each such approval not to be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed);
     provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,  "Eligible Assignee" shall not
     include  the  Borrower,  CEC  Entertainment  or any of CEC  Entertainment's
     Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

          "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will
     be)  engaged  in making,  purchasing,  holding or  otherwise  investing  in
     commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of
     its business.

          "Approved  Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a)
     a Lender,  (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of
     an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

     (h)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein, if at any
time  Bank of  America  assigns  all of its  Commitment  and Loans  pursuant  to
subsection (b) above,  Bank of America may, upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower
and the Lenders,  resign as L/C Issuer.  In the event of such resignation as L/C
Issuer,  the  Borrower  shall be  entitled  to appoint  from among the Lenders a
successor  L/C  Issuer  hereunder;  provided,  however,  that no  failure by the
Borrower to appoint any such successor  shall affect the  resignation of Bank of
America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain
all the rights and  obligations of the L/C Issuer  hereunder with respect to all
Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C
Issuer and all L/C  Obligations  with respect  thereto  (including  the right to
require   the  Lenders  to  make  Base  Rate   Committed   Loans  or  fund  risk
participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).


                                       73

     10.08 Confidentiality.

     Each of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  agrees to maintain  the
confidentiality  of the Information (as defined below),  except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors,  officers,  employees
and agents,  including  accountants,  legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood  that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the  confidential  nature  of such  Information  and  instructed  to  keep  such
Information  confidential);  (b)  to the  extent  requested  by  any  regulatory
authority;  (c) to the extent  required by applicable  laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement;
(e) in  connection  with the  exercise of any  remedies  hereunder  or any suit,
action or proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or the  enforcement  of rights
hereunder;  (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions  substantially the
same as those of this Section,  to (i) any Eligible  Assignee of or  Participant
in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights
or obligations  under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect  contractual
counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual  counterparty's or
prospective  counterparty's  professional  advisor)  to  any  credit  derivative
transaction relating to obligations of the Loan Parties; (g) with the consent of
the Borrower;  (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes  available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential  basis from a source
other  than  the  Borrower;  or (i) to the  National  Association  of  Insurance
Commissioners or any other similar organization. In addition, the Administrative
Agent  and  the  Lenders  may  disclose  the  existence  of this  Agreement  and
information  about this  Agreement to market data  collectors,  similar  service
providers to the lending industry,  and service providers to the  Administrative
Agent and the Lenders in connection  with the  administration  and management of
this  Agreement,  the other  Loan  Documents,  the  Commitments,  and the Credit
Extensions.   For  the  purposes  of  this  Section,   "Information"  means  all
information  received  from any Loan  Party  relating  to any Loan  Party or its
business,   other  than  any  such   information   that  is   available  to  the
Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender  on  a  nonconfidential  basis  prior  to
disclosure by any Loan Party; provided that, in the case of information received
from a Loan Party after the date hereof,  such information is clearly identified
in writing at the time of  delivery  as  confidential.  Any Person  required  to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered  to have  complied  with its  obligation  to do so if such Person has
exercised  the same  degree  of care to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

     10.09 Set-off.

     In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon
the occurrence and during the  continuance of any Event of Default,  each Lender
is  authorized  at any time and from time to time,  without  prior notice to the
Borrower or any other Loan Party,  any such notice  being waived by the Borrower
(on its own  behalf  and on  behalf of each Loan  Party) to the  fullest  extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time  or  demand,  provisional  or  final)  at  any  time  held  by,  and  other
indebtedness  at any time  owing by,  such  Lender  to or for the  credit or the
account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations  owing to
such  Lender  hereunder  or under  any other  Loan  Document,  now or  hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender
shall have made  demand  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  and


                                       74
<PAGE>

although such  Obligations  may be contingent or unmatured or  denominated  in a
currency  different from that of the applicable  deposit or  indebtedness.  Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender;  provided,  however,  that
the failure to give such notice  shall not affect the  validity of such  set-off
and application.

     10.10 Interest Rate Limitation.

     Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in any Loan  Document,
the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed
the maximum  rate of  non-usurious  interest  permitted by  applicable  Law (the
"Maximum Rate").  This Agreement has been executed under, and shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas,  except as such
laws are preempted by federal law. To the extent that the  Administrative  Agent
or a Lender is relying on Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code to determine the
Maximum  Rate  payable on the  Obligations,  such Person will utilize the weekly
ceiling  from time to time in effect as  provided  in such  Chapter  303. To the
extent federal law permits the Administrative Agent or a Lender to contract for,
charge or receive a greater amount of interest, such Person will rely on federal
law instead of such  article,  as amended,  for the purpose of  determining  the
Maximum  Rate.  In no event  shall the  provisions  of Chapter  346 of the Texas
Finance  Code  (which  regulates  certain  revolving  credit loan  accounts  and
revolving  triparty  accounts) apply to the Obligations.  If the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess  interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds  such unpaid  principal,  refunded to the  Borrower.  In  determining
whether the interest  contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Lender  exceeds  the  Maximum  Rate,  such  Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a)  characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense,  fee,  or premium  rather than  interest,  (b) exclude  voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize,  prorate,  allocate,  and
spread in equal or unequal  parts the total  amount of interest  throughout  the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

     10.11 Counterparts.

     This Agreement may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  each of which
shall be deemed an original,  but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

     10.12 Integration.

     This  Agreement,  together  with the other Loan  Documents,  comprises  the
complete and  integrated  agreement of the parties on the subject  matter hereof
and  thereof  and  supersedes  all prior  agreements,  written or oral,  on such
subject  matter.  In the event of any conflict  between the  provisions  of this
Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in
favor of the  Administrative  Agent or the  Lenders in any other  Loan  Document
shall not be deemed a  conflict  with this  Agreement.  Each Loan  Document  was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
with the fair meaning thereof.


                                       75

     10.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

     All  representations  and  warranties  made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or  therewith  shall  survive the  execution  and  delivery  hereof and
thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
the Administrative  Agent and each Lender,  regardless of any investigation made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any  Default at the time of any Credit  Extension,  and shall  continue  in full
force and  effect as long as any Loan or any other  Obligation  hereunder  shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

     10.14 Severability.

     If any provision of this  Agreement or the other Loan  Documents is held to
be  illegal,   invalid  or  unenforceable,   (a)  the  legality,   validity  and
enforceability of the remaining  provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents  shall not be affected or impaired  thereby and (b) the parties  shall
endeavor  in  good  faith  negotiations  to  replace  the  illegal,  invalid  or
unenforceable  provisions  with valid  provisions  the economic  effect of which
comes as close as  possible  to that of the  illegal,  invalid or  unenforceable
provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     10.15 Tax Forms.

     (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within the meaning
of Section  7701(a)(30)  of the Code (a "Foreign  Lender")  shall deliver to the
Administrative  Agent,  prior to receipt of any payment  subject to  withholding
under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly
signed  completed  copies of either  IRS Form  W-8BEN or any  successor  thereto
(relating to such Foreign  Lender and  entitling  it to an  exemption  from,  or
reduction of,  withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender
by the Borrower  pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor
thereto  (relating  to all  payments  to be made to such  Foreign  Lender by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence  satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.  withholding tax,  including any exemption
pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code.  Thereafter and from time to time,  each
such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the  Administrative  Agent such
additional  duly  completed  and  signed  copies  of one of such  forms (or such
successor  forms as shall be adopted  from time to time by the  relevant  United
States taxing  authorities)  as may then be available  under then current United
States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the
Borrower  and  the  Administrative  Agent  of any  available  exemption  from or
reduction of, United States  withholding  taxes in respect of all payments to be
made to such Foreign  Lender by the  Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement,  (B)
promptly notify the  Administrative  Agent of any change in circumstances  which
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction,  and (C) take
such steps as shall not be materially  disadvantageous  to it, in the reasonable
judgment of such  Lender,  and as may be  reasonably  necessary  (including  the
re-designation  of its Lending  Office) to avoid any  requirement  of applicable


                                       76
<PAGE>

Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding  for taxes from amounts
payable to such Foreign Lender.

     (ii) Each  Foreign  Lender,  to the extent it does not act or ceases to act
for its own account  with  respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to
such  Lender  under any of the Loan  Documents  (for  example,  in the case of a
typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
on the date when such  Foreign  Lender  ceases to act for its own  account  with
respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times
as may be necessary in the  determination  of the  Administrative  Agent (in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion),  (A) two duly signed completed copies of
the forms or  statements  required  to be  provided  by such Lender as set forth
above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to
which  such  Lender  acts  for  its own  account  that  is not  subject  to U.S.
withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or
any successor  thereto),  together with any  information  such Lender chooses to
transmit  with such form,  and any other  certificate  or statement of exemption
required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own
account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

     (iii) The Borrower  shall not be required to pay any  additional  amount to
any Foreign  Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required to
be  deducted  or  withheld  on the  basis of the  information,  certificates  or
statements of exemption such Lender  transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY  pursuant
to this Section  10.15(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the
foregoing  provisions  of this Section  10.15(a);  provided  that if such Lender
shall have satisfied the  requirement of this Section  10.15(a) on the date such
Lender  became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any
payment under any of the Loan Documents,  nothing in this Section 10.15(a) shall
relieve the Borrower of its  obligation  to pay any amounts  pursuant to Section
3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable  law, treaty
or governmental rule,  regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration  or  application  thereof,  such  Lender  is no  longer  properly
entitled to deliver forms,  certificates  or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing  the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which
such Lender  receives  any sums payable  under any of the Loan  Documents is not
subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

     (iv) The Administrative  Agent may, without  reduction,  withhold any Taxes
required  to be deducted  and  withheld  from any payment  under any of the Loan
Documents  with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay  additional
amounts under this Section 10.15(a).

     (b) Upon the  request of the  Administrative  Agent,  each Lender that is a
"United  States  person"  within the meaning of Section  7701(a)(30) of the Code
shall deliver to the  Administrative  Agent two duly signed  completed copies of
IRS  Form  W-9.  If  such  Lender  fails  to  deliver   such  forms,   then  the
Administrative  Agent may withhold  from any interest  payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

     (c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did
not properly  withhold or backup withhold,  as the case may be, any tax or other
amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall


                                       77
<PAGE>

indemnify  the  Administrative  Agent  therefor,  including  all  penalties  and
interest,  any taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on the amounts payable to the
Administrative  Agent  under this  Section,  and costs and  expenses  (including
Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under
this  Section  shall  survive  the  termination  of the  Aggregate  Commitments,
repayment  of  all  other  Obligations  hereunder  and  the  resignation  of the
Administrative Agent.

     10.16 Replacement of Lenders.

     (a) Under any  circumstances  set forth herein  providing that the Borrower
shall  have the  right to  remove,  replace  or add a Lender  as a party to this
Agreement,  the Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the  Administrative
Agent,  (i) remove such Lender by  terminating  such Lender's  Commitment,  (ii)
replace such Lender by requesting  such Lender to assign its  Commitment  (which
such Lender agrees to accomplish  and with the  assignment fee to be paid by the
Borrower in such  instance)  pursuant  to Section  10.07(b) to one or more other
Lenders or Eligible Assignees procured by the Borrower;  provided, however, that
if the  Borrower  elects to  exercise  such  right  with  respect  to any Lender
pursuant  to Section  3.06(b),  it shall be  obligated  to remove or replace all
Lenders that have made similar  requests  for  compensation  pursuant to Section
3.01 or Section  3.04, or (iii) add a Lender as provided in Section 2.15. If the
Borrower removes such Lender without replacement,  the Borrower shall (x) pay in
full all principal,  interest,  fees and other amounts  accrued or owing to such
Lender being removed through the date of removal  (including any amounts payable
pursuant to Section  3.05),  provided  that the making of such payment shall not
preclude  any claim by such  Lender for  amounts  which  shall  become due to it
thereafter  in  accordance  with the terms of the Loan  Documents,  (y)  provide
appropriate  assurances and indemnities (which may include letters of credit) to
the L/C Issuer as such may  reasonably  require with  respect to any  continuing
obligation  to purchase  participation  interests  in any L/C  Obligations  then
outstanding,  and (z) release  such Lender from its  obligations  under the Loan
Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an Assignment and
Assumption  substantially in the form of Exhibit E with respect to such Lender's
Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations,  whereby
the Lender being  replaced  irrevocably  sells and assigns to the Assignee  such
Lender's Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations.
The Administrative  Agent shall distribute an amended Schedule 2.01, which shall
be deemed incorporated into this Agreement, to reflect changes in the identities
of the Lenders and adjustments of their respective  Commitments  and/or Pro Rata
Shares resulting from such removal, replacement or addition.

     (b) In order to make all the Lenders' interest in any outstanding Committed
Loans ratable in accordance with any revised Pro Rata Shares after giving effect
to the removal,  replacement or addition of a Lender,  the Borrower shall pay or
prepay,  if necessary,  on the effective date thereof,  all outstanding Loans of
all Lenders,  together with any amounts due under Section 3.05. The Borrower may
then request  Loans from the Lenders in  accordance  with their revised Pro Rata
Shares.  The Borrower may net any payments required  hereunder against any funds
being provided by any Lender or New Lender replacing a terminating  Lender.  The
effect for purposes of this Agreement shall be the same as if separate transfers
of funds had been made with respect thereto.

     (c) This Section  shall  supercede  any  provision in Section  10.01 to the
contrary.

                                FORM OF GUARANTY
                   (Subsidiaries of CEC Entertainment, Inc.)

     This Guaranty  dated as of December 3, 2002  ("Agreement"),  is made by the
undersigned subsidiaries of CEC Entertainment,  Inc., a Kansas corporation (each
a  "Guarantor"),  in  favor  of  Bank  of  America,  N.A.,  in its  capacity  as
Administrative Agent ("Administrative Agent") for certain financial institutions
which are or may become parties to the Credit Agreement described below.

                                  INTRODUCTION

     This Agreement is given in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of
December 3, 2002 (as modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"),  among
ShowBiz  Merchandising,  L.P., a Texas  limited  partnership  ("Borrower"),  CEC
Entertainment, Inc., as a Guarantor, certain financial institutions which are or
may become  parties  thereto,  Bank One, NA, as  Syndication  Agent,  U.S.  Bank
National  Association,  as  Co-Documentation  Agent,  Fleet  National  Bank,  as
Co-Documentation Agent, and the Administrative Agent, the defined terms of which
are used herein unless otherwise defined herein. It is a condition  precedent to
the  obligation  of the Lenders to make any extension of credit under the Credit
Agreement  that  the  Guarantors  execute  and  deliver  this  Agreement  to the
Administrative  Agent. Each Guarantor is a Subsidiary of CEC Entertainment,  and
the  Borrower is a  Subsidiary  of CEC  Entertainment.  Because  each  Guarantor
receives  and, as a result of its  ownership  by CEC  Entertainment,  expects to
continue to receive  financial  support from CEC  Entertainment,  each Guarantor
will obtain  substantial  benefit from the  extensions of credit  expected to be
made to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement.

     Therefore,   to  induce  the   Administrative   Agent  and  such  financial
institutions  to enter into the Credit  Agreement,  the  Guarantors  jointly and
severally agree as follows:

     Section 1. Guaranty.  The Guarantors  irrevocably and jointly and severally
guarantee  to the  Administrative  Agent  (a) the full  payment  when due of all
principal, interest, fees, reimbursements, indemnifications, Attorney Costs, and
other  reasonable  amounts  now  or  hereafter  owed  by  the  Borrower  to  the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders (and with  respect to the Swap  Contracts,
the Affiliates of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders) under the terms of
the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  including amounts owed under
the terms of the Credit  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  for which the
Borrower obtains relief under bankruptcy or other laws providing for relief from
creditors,  (b) the full  payment  when due of any  increases,  extensions,  and
rearrangements of the foregoing  obligations under any amendments,  supplements,
and other  modifications of the documents and agreements  creating the foregoing
obligations,  and (c) any and all covenants and agreements of the Borrower under
the Credit  Agreement or other Loan  Documents,  whether  presently  existing or
hereinafter  entered  into,  will be duly and promptly  observed  and  performed
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations").  This is a guaranty of payment and
not merely a guaranty of  collection,  and each Guarantor is liable as a primary
obligor.  If any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  are  not  punctually  paid  or
performed when due,  whether by maturity,  acceleration,  or otherwise,  and the

Administrative  Agent shall notify any Guarantor of such default and make demand
for payment and/or performance  hereunder,  such Guarantor shall immediately pay
to the Administrative Agent the full amount of the Guaranteed  Obligations which
are  due  and  payable.   Each   Guarantor   shall  make  each  payment  to  the
Administrative Agent in U.S. Dollars in immediately  available funds as directed
by the Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative  Agent is hereby authorized at
any time  following  any demand for payment  hereunder  to set off and apply any
indebtedness owed by the  Administrative  Agent to any Guarantor against any and
all  of  the   obligations  of  such  Guarantor   under  this   Agreement.   The
Administrative  Agent agrees to promptly  notify such  Guarantor  after any such
setoff and application, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.

     Section 2. Guaranty Absolute.

     2.1 This Agreement  shall be deemed  accepted by the  Administrative  Agent
upon receipt,  and the  obligations of the  Guarantors  under this Agreement are
effective  immediately  and are continuing and cover all Guaranteed  Obligations
arising prior to and after the date hereof. This Agreement may not be revoked by
any  Guarantor  and shall  continue to be effective  with respect to  Guaranteed
Obligations arising or created after any attempted revocation by any Guarantor.

     2.2 Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed  Obligations will be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents,  regardless  of any law,  regulation,  or order now or  hereafter  in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto.  Each Guarantor agrees
that such  Guarantor's  obligations  under this Agreement shall not be released,
diminished,  or impaired  by, and waives any rights which such  Guarantor  might
otherwise have which relate to:

     (a) Any lack of validity or enforceability  of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
any Loan Document,  or any other agreement or instrument  relating thereto;  any
increase, reduction,  extension, or rearrangement of the Guaranteed Obligations;
any amendment,  supplement,  or other  modification of the Loan  Documents;  any
waiver or consent  granted under the Loan  Documents,  including  waivers of the
payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;  or any sale, assignment,
delegation,  or  other  transfer  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  the  Loan
Documents;

     (b) Any grant of any security or support for the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any  impairment  of any  security  or support  for the  Guaranteed  Obligations,
including any full or partial release, exchange,  subordination, or waste of any
collateral for the Guaranteed  Obligations or any full or partial release of the
Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any  other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or
performance of the Guaranteed  Obligations;  any change in the  organization  or
structure of the  Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any other Person liable for the
payment  or  performance  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations;  or  the  insolvency,
bankruptcy,  liquidation,  or dissolution of the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any
other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or   performance   of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations;


                                       F-2
<PAGE>

     (c) The manner of applying  payments on the  Guaranteed  Obligations or the
proceeds of any security or support for the Guaranteed  Obligations  against the
Guaranteed Obligations;

     (d) The  failure to give notice of the  occurrence  of any of the events or
actions  referred  to in this  Section  2.2,  notice of any  Default or Event of
Default,  however  denominated,  under the Loan  Documents,  notice of intent to
demand,  notice  of  demand,  notice  of  presentment  for  payment,  notice  of
nonpayment,  notice of intent to protest,  notice of  protest,  notice of grace,
notice of  dishonor,  notice of intent to  accelerate,  notice of  acceleration,
notice of  bringing  of action to  enforce  the  payment or  performance  of the
Guaranteed Obligations,  notice of any sale or foreclosure of any collateral for
the   Guaranteed   Obligations,   notice  of  any  transfer  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  notice  of  the  financial  condition  of or  other  circumstances
regarding  the  Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any other  Person  liable for the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any  other  notice  of  any  kind  relating  to the
Guaranteed  Obligations  (and the  parties  intend  that no  Guarantor  shall be
considered  a "Debtor"  as defined in Section  9.102 of the Texas  Business  and
Commerce Code for the purpose of notices  required to be given to a Debtor under
such code); or

     (e) Any  other  action  taken  or  omitted  which  affects  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  whether or not such action or omission prejudices any Guarantor or
increases  the  likelihood  that  any  Guarantor  will  be  required  to pay the
Guaranteed  Obligations  pursuant to the terms hereof--it is the unambiguous and
unequivocal  intention of each Guarantor that such Guarantor  shall be obligated
to pay the Guaranteed  Obligations  when due,  notwithstanding  any  occurrence,
circumstance,  event,  action, or omission  whatsoever,  whether contemplated or
uncontemplated, and whether or not particularly described herein.

     2.3 This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the
case may be, if any payment on the Guaranteed  Obligations  must be refunded for
any  reason  including  any  bankruptcy  proceeding.   In  the  event  that  the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender must refund any payment received against the
Guaranteed Obligations, any prior release from the terms of this Agreement given
to any Guarantor by the  Administrative  Agent shall be without effect, and this
Agreement  shall be reinstated in full force and effect.  It is the intention of
each  Guarantor  that  such  Guarantor's  obligations  hereunder  shall  not  be
discharged except by final payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

     2.4 (a) Each  Guarantor is a Subsidiary of CEC  Entertainment  and receives
and,  because of its  ownership  by CEC  Entertainment,  expects to  continue to
receive business opportunities and financial support from CEC Entertainment. The
Borrower is a Subsidiary of CEC  Entertainment  and CEC  Entertainment  receives
and,  because of its ownership of the  Borrower,  expects to continue to receive
business opportunities and financial benefits from the Borrower.  Each Guarantor
has agreed to enter into this  Agreement  so that the  Borrower  can receive the
benefits of the Guaranteed Obligations and continue to provide these services to
CEC Entertainment, who provides these services to such Guarantor.

     (b) If it is  judicially  determined  with  respect to any  Guarantor  that
entering  into this  Agreement  would  violate  Section 548 of the United States
Bankruptcy  Code or any  comparable  provisions  of any  state  law,  then  such
Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty only for amounts aggregating up to


                                       F-3
<PAGE>

the largest amount that would not render such Guarantor's  obligations hereunder
subject to avoidance  under Section 548 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provisions of any state law.

     (c) Each  Guarantor  agrees  that  each  Guarantor  shall  have  rights  of
contribution  and  subrogation  against each other Guarantor with respect to any
payments made in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations.

     Section 3. Unimpaired Collection.

     3.1 There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this Agreement,
except  as  expressly  contained  herein.  It  shall  not be  necessary  for the
Administrative  Agent,  in order to enforce  payment by any Guarantor under this
Agreement,  to  show  any  proof  of the  Borrower's  default,  to  exhaust  the
Administrative  Agent's  remedies  against the Borrower,  any Guarantor,  or any
other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or   performance   of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  to enforce any security or support for the payment or  performance
of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or to  enforce  any other  means of  obtaining
payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Each Guarantor waives any
rights under Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code,  Section 17.001
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and Rule 31 of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure related to the foregoing.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor
the Lenders  shall be required to mitigate  damages or take any other  action to
reduce, collect, or enforce the Guaranteed Obligations.

     3.2 With respect to each Guarantor,  all  Subordinated  Obligations of such
Guarantor (as defined below) shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment
and  collection  to the  payment  and  collection  in  full  of  all  Guaranteed
Obligations as described below:

     (a) As used herein, the term "Subordinated  Obligations" for such Guarantor
means: (i) all present and future indebtedness,  liabilities, and obligations of
any kind owed by the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other Person liable for the
payment  or  performance  of  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  to  such  Guarantor,
including  debt   obligations,   equity   obligations,   and  other  contractual
obligations  requiring  payments  of any kind to be made to such  Guarantor  and
including  any  right  of  subrogation   (including  any  statutory   rights  of
subrogation  under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ' 509, or under
Chapter  34  of  the  Texas   Business   and   Commerce   Code),   contribution,
indemnification,  reimbursement, exoneration, or any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the Administrative Agent against the Borrower, any Guarantor,
or  any  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or  performance  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  or any collateral  which the  Administrative  Agent now has or may
acquire, and (ii) any increases, extensions, and rearrangements of the foregoing
obligations under any amendments,  supplements,  and other  modifications of the
documents and agreements creating the foregoing obligations.

     (b) Until all Guaranteed  Obligations  have been  irrevocably  paid in full
(and  therefore the payment  thereof is no longer  subject to being set aside or
returned under the law), such Guarantor agrees not to take any action to enforce
payment of the Subordinated  Obligations of such Guarantor,  but this standstill
is  not  intended  as a  permanent  waiver  of  the  subrogation,  contribution,
indemnification,  reimbursement,  exoneration, participation, or other rights of
such Guarantor.

     (c) Upon any receivership,  insolvency  proceeding,  bankruptcy proceeding,
assignment  for the  benefit  of  creditors,  reorganization,  arrangement  with
creditors, sale of assets for creditors, dissolution, liquidation, or marshaling
of the assets of the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other Person liable for the
payment or  performance  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  all  amounts due with
respect  to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  be  paid in  full  before  such
Guarantor  shall be entitled to collect or receive any payment  with  respect to
the Subordinated  Obligations of such Guarantor,  and all payments to which such
Guarantor  would  be  entitled  to  collect  or  receive  on  the   Subordinated
Obligations of such Guarantor shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for
application to the Guaranteed Obligations.

     (d) Following written notice from the Administrative  Agent to the Borrower
that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and that no
further payments shall be made on the Subordinated Obligations of such Guarantor
until (i) all amounts due with respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall be
paid  in full or  (ii)  the  Administrative  Agent  revokes  such  notice,  such
Guarantor  shall not be entitled to collect or receive any payment  with respect
to the Subordinated Obligations of such Guarantor.

     (e) If applicable,  any lien, security interest, or assignment securing the
repayment  of the  Subordinated  Obligations  of such  Guarantor  shall be fully
subordinate to any lien,  security interest,  or assignment,  if applicable,  in
favor of the Administrative Agent which secures the Guaranteed  Obligations.  At
the request of the  Administrative  Agent,  such Guarantor will take any and all
steps necessary to fully evidence the subordination granted hereunder, including
amending  or  terminating  financing  statements  and  executing  and  recording
subordinations of liens.

     (f) This is an absolute and irrevocable  agreement of subordination and the
Administrative  Agent may,  without  notice to such  Guarantor,  take any action
described in Section 2.2 without  impairing or releasing the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder.

     (g) Such  Guarantor  shall not assign or  otherwise  transfer  to any other
Person any interest in the  Subordinated  Obligations of such  Guarantor  unless
such Guarantor causes the assignee or other transferee to execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent a subordination  agreement in substantially the form of
the subordination provisions in this Agreement.

     (h) If any amount  shall be paid to such  Guarantor  in  violation  of this
Section  3.2,  such  amount  shall  be held in  trust  for  the  benefit  of the
Administrative  Agent and immediately turned over to the  Administrative  Agent,
with any necessary endorsement, to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations.

     Section 4. Miscellaneous.

     4.1  Each   Guarantor   hereby   affirms   and   shall   comply   with  the
representations,  warranties,  and covenants  made by the Borrower in the Credit
Agreement to the extent that such representations, warranties, and covenants are
applicable  to  such  Guarantor,   including  all  of  the  representations  and
warranties  in Article V of the Credit  Agreement  and all of the  covenants  in

reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and  expenses  of the  Administrative  Agent in
connection   with  the   preparation,   execution,   delivery,   administration,
modification,  and amendment of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents to

claims, actions, suits, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,  liabilities,  and

Guarantor in this  Agreement  shall survive the execution of this  Agreement and

Agreement  and the Loan  Documents  to which any  Guarantor  is a party shall be
cumulative,  and no delay in enforcing  this Agreement and the Loan Documents to
which  such  Guarantor  is a party  shall act as a waiver of the  Administrative
Agent's  rights  thereunder.  The  provisions of this Agreement may be waived or
amended  only in a writing  signed  by the party  against  whom  enforcement  is
sought. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and

                                FORM OF GUARANTY
                           (CEC Entertainment, Inc.)

     This Guaranty  dated as of December 3, 2002  ("Agreement"),  is made by CEC
Entertainment,  Inc., a Kansas  corporation  ("Guarantor"),  in favor of Bank of
America, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent ("Administrative  Agent")
for certain financial institutions which are or may become parties to the Credit
Agreement described below.

                                  INTRODUCTION

     This Agreement is given in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of
December 3, 2002 (as modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"),  among
ShowBiz   Merchandising,   L.P.,  a  Texas  limited  partnership   ("Borrower"),
Guarantor,  certain  financial  institutions  which  are or may  become  parties
thereto, Bank One, NA, as Syndication Agent, U.S. Bank National Association,  as
Co-Documentation  Agent, Fleet National Bank, as Co-Documentation Agent, and the
Administrative  Agent,  the  defined  terms of  which  are  used  herein  unless
otherwise defined herein.  It is a condition  precedent to the obligation of the
Lenders to make any  extension  of credit  under the Credit  Agreement  that the
Guarantor  execute and deliver this Agreement to the  Administrative  Agent. The
Borrower is a Subsidiary of the Guarantor.  Because the Guarantor  receives and,
as a result of its  ownership  of the  Borrower,  expects to continue to receive
financial  benefits from the Borrower,  the  Guarantor  will obtain  substantial
benefit from the extensions of credit  expected to be made to the Borrower under
the Credit Agreement.

     Therefore,   to  induce  the   Administrative   Agent  and  such  financial
institutions  to enter into the Credit  Agreement,  the  Guarantor,  jointly and
severally with all other Guarantors, agrees as follows:


     Section 1. Guaranty.

     The  Guarantor  irrevocably,  and  jointly  and  severally  with all  other
Guarantors, guarantees to the Administrative Agent (a) the full payment when due
of all principal,  interest, fees,  reimbursements,  indemnifications,  Attorney
Costs,  and  other  amounts  now  or  hereafter  owed  by  the  Borrower  to the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders (and with  respect to the Swap  Contracts,
the Affiliates of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders) under the terms of
the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  including amounts owed under
the terms of the Credit  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  for which the
Borrower obtains relief under bankruptcy or other laws providing for relief from
creditors,  (b) the full  payment  when due of any  increases,  extensions,  and
rearrangements of the foregoing  obligations under any amendments,  supplements,
and other  modifications of the documents and agreements  creating the foregoing
obligations,  and (c) any and all covenants and agreements of the Borrower under
the Credit  Agreement or other Loan  Documents,  whether  presently  existing or
hereinafter  entered  into,  will be duly and promptly  observed  and  performed
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations").  This is a guaranty of payment and
not merely a guaranty of  collection,  and the  Guarantor is liable as a primary
obligor.  If any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  are  not  punctually  paid  or


                                       I-1
<PAGE>

performed when due,  whether by maturity,  acceleration,  or otherwise,  and the
Administrative  Agent shall notify the Guarantor of such default and make demand
for payment and/or performance hereunder, the Guarantor shall immediately pay to
the Administrative Agent the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations which are
due and payable.  The  Guarantor  shall make each payment to the  Administrative
Agent  in U.S.  Dollars  in  immediately  available  funds  as  directed  by the
Administrative  Agent. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized at any time
following any demand for payment hereunder to set off and apply any indebtedness
owed by the  Administrative  Agent to the  Guarantor  against any and all of the
obligations of the Guarantor  under this  Agreement.  The  Administrative  Agent
agrees to promptly notify the Guarantor  after any such setoff and  application,
but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff
and application.

     Section 2. Guaranty Absolute.

     2.1 This Agreement  shall be deemed  accepted by the  Administrative  Agent
upon receipt,  and the  obligations  of the Guarantor  under this  Agreement are
effective  immediately  and are continuing and cover all Guaranteed  Obligations
arising prior to and after the date hereof. This Agreement may not be revoked by
the  Guarantor  and shall  continue to be effective  with respect to  Guaranteed
Obligations arising or created after any attempted revocation by the Guarantor.

     2.2 The Guarantor  guarantees that the Guaranteed  Obligations will be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents,  regardless  of any law,  regulation,  or order now or  hereafter  in
effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the  rights of the
Administrative  Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto.  The Guarantor agrees
that its obligations under this Agreement shall not be released,  diminished, or
impaired  by, and waives any rights which it might  otherwise  have which relate
to:

     (a) Any lack of validity or enforceability  of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
any Loan Document,  or any other agreement or instrument  relating thereto;  any
increase, reduction,  extension, or rearrangement of the Guaranteed Obligations;
any amendment,  supplement,  or other  modification of the Loan  Documents;  any
waiver or consent  granted under the Loan  Documents,  including  waivers of the
payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;  or any sale, assignment,
delegation,  or  other  transfer  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  the  Loan
Documents;


     (b) Any grant of any security or support for the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any  impairment  of any  security  or support  for the  Guaranteed  Obligations,
including any full or partial release, exchange,  subordination, or waste of any
collateral for the Guaranteed  Obligations or any full or partial release of the
Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any  other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or
performance of the Guaranteed  Obligations;  any change in the  organization  or
structure of the  Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any other Person liable for the
payment  or  performance  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations;  or  the  insolvency,
bankruptcy,  liquidation,  or dissolution of the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any
other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or   performance   of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations;


                                       I-2
<PAGE>

     (c) The manner of applying  payments on the  Guaranteed  Obligations or the
proceeds of any security or support for the Guaranteed  Obligations  against the
Guaranteed Obligations;

     (d) The  failure to give notice of the  occurrence  of any of the events or
actions  referred  to in this  Section  2.2,  notice of any  Default or Event of
Default,  however  denominated,  under the Loan  Documents,  notice of intent to
demand,  notice  of  demand,  notice  of  presentment  for  payment,  notice  of
nonpayment,  notice of intent to protest,  notice of  protest,  notice of grace,
notice of  dishonor,  notice of intent to  accelerate,  notice of  acceleration,
notice of  bringing  of action to  enforce  the  payment or  performance  of the
Guaranteed Obligations,  notice of any sale or foreclosure of any collateral for
the   Guaranteed   Obligations,   notice  of  any  transfer  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  notice  of  the  financial  condition  of or  other  circumstances
regarding  the  Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  or any other  Person  liable for the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any  other  notice  of  any  kind  relating  to the
Guaranteed  Obligations  (and the  parties  intend  that no  Guarantor  shall be
considered  a "Debtor"  as defined in Section  9.102 of the Texas  Business  and
Commerce Code for the purpose of notices  required to be given to a Debtor under
such code); or

     (e) Any  other  action  taken  or  omitted  which  affects  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  whether or not such action or omission prejudices the Guarantor or
increases  the  likelihood  that  the  Guarantor  will  be  required  to pay the
Guaranteed  Obligations  pursuant to the terms hereof--it is the unambiguous and
unequivocal  intention  of the  Guarantor  that it shall be obligated to pay the
Guaranteed Obligations when due,  notwithstanding any occurrence,  circumstance,
event, action, or omission  whatsoever,  whether contemplated or uncontemplated,
and whether or not particularly described herein.


     2.3 This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the
case may be, if any payment on the Guaranteed  Obligations  must be refunded for
any  reason  including  any  bankruptcy  proceeding.   In  the  event  that  the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender must refund any payment received against the
Guaranteed Obligations, any prior release from the terms of this Agreement given
to the Guarantor by the  Administrative  Agent shall be without effect, and this
Agreement  shall be reinstated in full force and effect.  It is the intention of
the Guarantor that its obligations  hereunder shall not be discharged  except by
final payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

     2.4 (a) The Borrower is a Subsidiary  of the  Guarantor  and the  Guarantor
receives and,  because of its ownership of the Borrower,  expects to continue to
receive business  opportunities  and financial  benefits from the Borrower.  The
Guarantor  has  agreed to enter into this  Agreement  so that the  Borrower  can
receive the benefits of the Guaranteed Obligations and continue to provide these
services to the Guarantor.

     (b) If it is  judicially  determined  with  respect to the  Guarantor  that
entering  into this  Agreement  would  violate  Section 548 of the United States
Bankruptcy  Code  or any  comparable  provisions  of any  state  law,  then  the
Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty only for amounts aggregating up to
the largest amount that would not render the Guarantor=s  obligations  hereunder
subject to avoidance  under Section 548 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provisions of any state law.


                                       I-3
<PAGE>

     (c)  The  Guarantor  agrees  that  each  Guarantor  shall  have  rights  of
contribution  and  subrogation  against each other Guarantor with respect to any
payments made in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations.

     Section 3. Unimpaired Collection.

     3.1 There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this Agreement,
except  as  expressly  contained  herein.  It  shall  not be  necessary  for the
Administrative  Agent,  in order to enforce  payment by the Guarantor under this
Agreement,  to  show  any  proof  of the  Borrower's  default,  to  exhaust  the
Administrative  Agent's  remedies  against the Borrower,  any Guarantor,  or any
other  Person  liable  for  the  payment  or   performance   of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  to enforce any security or support for the payment or  performance
of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or to  enforce  any other  means of  obtaining
payment or performance of the Guaranteed  Obligations.  The Guarantor waives any
rights under Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code,  Section 17.001
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and Rule 31 of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure related to the foregoing.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor
the Lenders  shall be required to mitigate  damages or take any other  action to
reduce, collect, or enforce the Guaranteed Obligations.

     3.2 All Subordinated  Obligations of the Guarantor (as defined below) shall
be subordinate  and junior in right of payment and collection to the payment and
collection in full of all Guaranteed Obligations as described below:

     (a) As used herein, the term  "Subordinated  Obligations" for the Guarantor
means: (i) all present and future indebtedness,  liabilities, and obligations of
any kind owed by the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other Person liable for the
payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guarantor, including
debt  obligations,   equity  obligations,   and  other  contractual  obligations
requiring  payments of any kind to be made to the  Guarantor  and  including any
right of  subrogation  (including  any  statutory  rights of  subrogation  under
Section 509 of the Bankruptcy  Code, 11 U.S.C. ' 509, or under Chapter 34 of the
Texas Business and Commerce Code), contribution, indemnification, reimbursement,
exoneration,  or  any  right  to  participate  in any  claim  or  remedy  of the
Administrative Agent against the Borrower,  any Guarantor,  or any Person liable
for the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations,  or any collateral
which the Administrative  Agent now has or may acquire,  and (ii) any increases,
extensions,   and   rearrangements  of  the  foregoing   obligations  under  any
amendments, supplements, and other modifications of the documents and agreements
creating the foregoing obligations.

     (b) Until all Guaranteed  Obligations  have been  irrevocably  paid in full
(and  therefore the payment  thereof is no longer  subject to being set aside or
returned under the law), the Guarantor  agrees not to take any action to enforce
payment of the Subordinated Obligations of the Guarantor, but this standstill is
not  intended  as  a  permanent   waiver  of  the   subrogation,   contribution,
indemnification,  reimbursement,  exoneration, participation, or other rights of
the Guarantor.


                                       I-4
<PAGE>

     (c) Upon any receivership,  insolvency  proceeding,  bankruptcy proceeding,
assignment  for the  benefit  of  creditors,  reorganization,  arrangement  with
creditors, sale of assets for creditors, dissolution, liquidation, or marshaling
of the assets of the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other Person liable for the
payment or  performance  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  all  amounts due with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall be paid in full before the Guarantor
shall be  entitled  to  collect  or  receive  any  payment  with  respect to the
Subordinated  Obligations  of the  Guarantor,  and all  payments  to  which  the
Guarantor  would  be  entitled  to  collect  or  receive  on  the   Subordinated
Obligations of the Guarantor shall be paid over to the Administrative  Agent for
application to the Guaranteed Obligations.

     (d) Following written notice from the Administrative  Agent to the Borrower
that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and that no
further payments shall be made on the Subordinated  Obligations of the Guarantor
until (i) all amounts due with respect to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall be
paid in full or (ii) the Administrative Agent revokes such notice, the Guarantor
shall not be  entitled to collect or receive  any  payment  with  respect to the
Subordinated Obligations of the Guarantor.


     (e) If applicable,  any lien, security interest, or assignment securing the
repayment  of the  Subordinated  Obligations  of the  Guarantor  shall  be fully
subordinate to any lien,  security interest,  or assignment,  if applicable,  in
favor of the Administrative Agent which secures the Guaranteed  Obligations.  At
the request of the  Administrative  Agent,  the Guarantor  will take any and all
steps necessary to fully evidence the subordination granted hereunder, including
amending  or  terminating  financing  statements  and  executing  and  recording
subordinations of liens.

     (f) This is an absolute and irrevocable  agreement of subordination and the
Administrative  Agent  may,  without  notice to the  Guarantor,  take any action
described in Section 2.2 without  impairing or releasing the  obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder.

     (g) The  Guarantor  shall not  assign or  otherwise  transfer  to any other
Person any interest in the Subordinated  Obligations of the Guarantor unless the
Guarantor  causes the assignee or other transferee to execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent a subordination  agreement in substantially the form of the
subordination provisions in this Agreement.

     (h) If any  amount  shall be paid to the  Guarantor  in  violation  of this
Section  3.2,  such  amount  shall  be held in  trust  for  the  benefit  of the
Administrative  Agent and immediately turned over to the  Administrative  Agent,
with any necessary endorsement, to be applied to the Guaranteed Obligations.

     Section 4. Miscellaneous.

     4.1 The Guarantor hereby affirms and shall comply with the representations,
warranties,  and covenants  made by the Borrower in the Credit  Agreement to the
extent that such  representations,  warranties,  and covenants are applicable to
the Guarantor,  including all of the representations and warranties in Article V
of the Credit  Agreement  and all of the covenants in Article VI and Article VII
of the Credit Agreement.

     4.2 The Guarantor shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent on demand (a) all
reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and  expenses  of the  Administrative  Agent in
connection   with  the   preparation,   execution,   delivery,   administration,
modification,  and amendment of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents to
which any Guarantor is a party,  including the reasonable fees and out of pocket
expenses  of  outside  counsel  for the  Administrative  Agent  with  respect to
advising the Administrative  Agent as to its rights and  responsibilities  under
this Agreement and the Loan Documents to which any Guarantor is a party, and (b)
all  costs and  expenses  of the  Administrative  Agent in  connection  with the

other  Loan  Documents  to  which  any  Guarantor  is a party,  whether  through
negotiations,  legal proceedings,  or otherwise,  including fees and expenses of

the  Administrative  Agent,  each Lender,  and each of their respective  Related

costs and expenses, including reasonable costs of attorneys and related costs of
experts  such as  accountants  (collectively,  the  "Indemnified  Liabilities"),
actually incurred by the Indemnified Parties which are related to any litigation
or  proceeding  relating  to  this  Agreement,   the  Loan  Documents,   or  the

termination  of this  Agreement and the Loan  Documents  that does not expressly

     4.4 If any provision in this  Agreement is held to be  unenforceable,  such
provision  shall be severed and the  remaining  provisions  shall remain in full
force  and  effect.  All  representations,  warranties,  and  covenants  of  the
Guarantor in this  Agreement  shall survive the execution of this  Agreement and
any other contract or agreement.  The Administrative Agent's remedies under this
Agreement  and the Loan  Documents  to which the  Guarantor  is a party shall be
cumulative,  and no delay in enforcing  this Agreement and the Loan Documents to
which the  Guarantor  is a party  shall  act as a waiver  of the  Administrative
Agent's  rights  thereunder.  The  provisions of this Agreement may be waived or
amended  only in a writing  signed  by the party  against  whom  enforcement  is
sought.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Guarantor and
the  Administrative  Agent and their  respective  successors  and  assigns.  The
