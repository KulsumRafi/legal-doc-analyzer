than a full calendar month at the beginning of the Term on the Commencement
Date.

due and (ii) interest on that portion of any amount of Rent or other amount due

Rate(s) in effect from time to time plus two additional percentage points from
the day such portion is first due through the day of receipt thereof by the
Landlord. Any such late charge due from the Tenant shall be due immediately.
Anything hereinabove contained to the contrary notwithstanding, it is expressly
understood and agreed that no late charge shall be imposed if Rent is not paid
by the fifth day of the month provided that if Rent is not paid by the fifth day
of the month more than twice in any twelve month period then, thereafter, the
late charge shall be imposed if Rent is not paid by the first day of the month.

4.      Term.

4.1.    The Initial Term shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall
continue for five years from the beginning of the Initial Year, unless sooner

                forth in this subsection 4.2.2 of the Agreement that is
                specifically applicable shall have occurred:

                4.2.2.1. if the Leased Premises is being prepared exclusively by
                         contractors selected and retained by the Landlord, the

                         for its intended use;

                4.2.2.2. preparation of the Leased Premises in accordance with
                         the Tenant Plan is substantially completed (except for
                         (i) any long lead time items that may be required that
                         can not be delivered to the Leased Premises in
                         sufficient time to be incorporated into the work in
                         proper sequence and (ii) any preparation work that is
                         not being performed exclusively by contractors selected
                         and retained by the Landlord); and



                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                4.2.2.3. the Landlord can deliver actual and exclusive
                         possession of the Leased Premises, free of rubbish and
                         debris, to the Tenant (except for any contractors not
                         selected and retained by the Landlord and their rubbish
                         and debris); and

                4.2.2.4. Landlord has secured a Certificate of Occupancy from
                         the public authority with jurisdiction over the Leased
                         Premises. If the Certificate of Occupancy is a
                         temporary certificate then Landlord shall satisfy the
                         conditions in a timely manner even though the
                         Commencement Date has occurred.

4.3.    In the event one or more of the conditions contemplated by this
subsection 4.3 of the Agreement occurs, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in subsection 4.2 of this Agreement, the Commencement Date shall be
the earliest applicable date specified below:

        4.3.1.  the Target Date in the event the Tenant does not timely: (i)
                deliver the Tenant Plan to the Landlord by the Tenant Plan Due
                Date and (ii) sign and return the notice contemplated by the
                last sentence of subsection 5.4 of this Agreement to the
                Landlord and (iii) make the initial payment contemplated by the
                next to last sentence of subsection 5.4 of this Agreement to the
                Landlord; or

        4.3.2.  the date that the last of the conditions set forth in subsection
                4.2.2 of this Agreement that is specifically applicable shall
                have occurred if (i) the Tenant shall have requested the
                Landlord or any contractors selected and retained by the
                Landlord to complete their work before the Target Date and (ii)
                they shall have done so.

4.4.    Once it is ascertained in accordance with subsections 4.2 and 4.3 of
this Agreement, the Landlord shall give prompt notice of the Commencement Date
to the Tenant; and if the Tenant does not object thereto by notice given to the
Landlord within 10 days of the Landlord's notice, the date set forth in the
Landlord's notice shall thereafter be conclusively presumed to be the
Commencement Date.

5.      Preparation of the Leased Premises.

5.1.    Unless previously accomplished, within one week after execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Tenant shall give notice to the Landlord
including therewith each of the following:

        5.1.1.  a conceptual drawing, as detailed as practicable, of the
                proposed Tenant Plan; and

        5.1.2.  an itemized list, as detailed as practicable, of the types and
                quantities of materials, supplies, equipment and work to be
                incorporated into the Tenant Plan by the Tenant.

5.2.    Unless previously accomplished, within two weeks after receipt of the
notice contemplated by subsection 5.1, the Landlord shall give notice to the
Tenant of the Landlord's contractors' estimated unit prices to build out the
Leased Premises, including unit prices for each item included in that notice as
to which sufficient information has been provided by the Tenant in that notice.

5.3.    If, at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Tenant shall not have requested the Landlord in writing to provide the Tenant
Plan, the Tenant shall deliver the complete Tenant Plan to the Landlord not
later than the Tenant Plan Due Date. The Tenant Plan shall be at the Tenant's
expense.

5.4.    Within two weeks after receipt of the Tenant Plan, the Landlord shall
give notice to the Tenant of the Landlord's price to the Tenant to supply or
perform, or both, the work contemplated by the Tenant Plan being provided by the
Landlord or the Landlord's contractors. Such price shall include 7% overhead and
7% profit of the Landlord's contractors' aggregate price in excess of the
Allowance as the Landlord's



                                      -3-
<PAGE>

general contracting fee and shall be net of any credit for work being provided
by the Landlord without charge to the Tenant in accordance with the Work Letter.
If acceptable to the Tenant, the Tenant shall sign a copy of the notice and
return it to the Landlord, together with payment of 33-1/3% of the excess over
the Allowance, if any, within three business days after it was given authorizing
the Landlord and the Landlord's contractors to supply or perform the work
contemplated by both the Tenant Plan and the notice at the price set forth in
the notice. The Tenant shall pay the balance of such price to the Landlord in
proportion to the progress of such work, as and when billed by the Landlord at
convenient intervals, with payment of any remaining final balance due from the
Tenant prior to the Commencement Date. Tenant shall have the right to review the
line items in the bids taken by the Landlord.

5.5.    If Landlord's price is not acceptable to the Tenant, the Tenant shall
attempt to negotiate an acceptable price within the next three business days. If
the parties are unable to agree then the Tenant may engage its own contractors
to perform the work provided that Tenant shall be required to utilize the
services of the HVAC contractor used by the Landlord in the Building. In this
event, the Commencement Date shall be the Target Date. Landlord shall advance
the Allowance ratably as the work progresses with a 10% retainage. The balance
shall be paid prior to the Commencement Date.

5.6.    If the price is less than the Allowance, the Landlord shall pay the
balance of the Allowance toward the cost of equipment, fixtures and other
installations by the Tenant in the Leased Premises.

5.7.    During the period that Landlord is fitting-up the Leased Premises for
Tenant, Tenant may move in its furniture, furnishings, equipment and supplies
into the Leased Premises and may install its Wiring provided that (i) the
furniture, furnishings, equipment and supplies may only be moved in after the
carpet is installed; (ii) no personnel may move in and commence operations in
the Leased Premises until after a certificate of occupancy is issued; (iii)
Tenant shall assume full responsibility for anything which it places in the
Leased Premises and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord from any
loss, liability and expense which arises from Tenant's actions or those of its
agents, servants, employees, invitees and contractors. If any of Tenant's
operations interfere with the progress of Landlord's work, Tenant shall cease
such operations forthwith until Landlord advises that such operations may be
resumed.

6.      Options.

6.1.    Tenant is hereby granted one option to renew this Lease for one five
year period upon the following terms and conditions:

        6.1.1.  At the time of the exercise of the option to renew and at the
                time of said renewal, the Tenant shall not be in default in
                accordance with the terms and provisions of this Lease, and
                shall occupy and be in operation at the entire Leased Premises
                pursuant to this Lease.

        6.1.2.  Notice of the exercise of the option shall be sent to the
                Landlord in writing at least nine (9) months before the
                expiration of the initial term.

        6.1.3.  The renewal term shall be for a period of five years to commence
                at the expiration of the initial term, and all of the terms and
                conditions of this Agreement, other than the amount of Annual
                Rent, shall apply during any such renewal term.

        6.1.4.  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, the Annual Rent
                to be paid during the renewal term shall equal the fair market
                rental value of the Leased Premises if the same were available
                for lease to the public. If the parties are unable to agree on
                the fair market rental value of the Leased Premises, the parties
                shall each appoint one appraiser who shall in turn appoint a
                third independent appraiser and the determination of said three
                appraisers shall be binding on the parties. In no event,
                however, shall the annual basic rent



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

        payable by Tenant during the renewal period be less than the annual
        basic rent payable by Tenant during the immediately preceding twelve
        months.

6.2.    Tenant is granted a right of first offer (the "Right of First Offer") on
the following terms.

        6.2.1.  If Landlord desires to lease the space contiguous to the Leased
                Premises shown on Exhibit B (the "Contiguous Space"), Landlord
                shall notify Tenant in writing of the proposed commencement
                date. The rental rate and the other economic terms shall be
                substantially similar to the terms contained in this Lease.
                Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing within five (5) days
                after Tenant's receipt of such notice from Landlord as to
                whether or not Tenant elects to lease such space. If Tenant
                either notifies Landlord that Tenant does not wish to lease such
                space, or Tenant fails to so notify Landlord within such five
                (5) day period, then Tenant's Right of First Offer shall cease
                and Landlord may let such space without giving Tenant any
                further notice thereof.

        6.2.2.  Tenant's notice exercising the Right of First Offer shall
                constitute a binding commitment to lease the specified space on

                 area which are properly treated as an expense fully deductible
                 as incurred in accordance with generally applied real estate
                 accounting practice. In determining Base Year Operational

                 event, the actual expense incurred for the line item in the
                 Base Year shall be adjusted to equal the amount incurred for
                 the same line item for the year prior to the Base Year
                 multiplied by the sum of one plus the percentage increase in

        10.3.2. all costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord to replace any
                parts of the Property, the Building or the Common Facilities if
                Landlord, in the reasonable exercise of its judgment determines
                that the amortized cost of replacement will be less than the
                cost of maintenance and repair of the replaced item or if the
                item cannot be repaired and must be replaced; and

        10.3.3. all costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord in connection

                Premises or generally to the Building or the Common Facilities;

                          Tenant shall forthwith obtain and file the complete
                          discharge and release thereof or provide such payment
                          bond(s) from a reputable, financially sound
                          institutional surety as will, in the opinions of the
                          Landlord, the holders of any mortgage indebtedness on,
                          or other interest in, the Property, the Building, the
                          Common Facilities or any other improvements on the
                          Property, or any portions thereof, and their
                          respective title insurers, be adequate to assure the
                          complete discharge and release thereof;

                12.2.4.4. prior to any such contractor's entering upon the
                          Property, the Building or the Leased Premises or
                          commencing work the Tenant shall have delivered to the
                          Landlord (a) all the Tenant's certificates of
                          insurance set forth in section 14 of this Agreement,
                          conforming in all respects to the requirements of
                          section 14 of this Agreement, except that the
                          effective dates of all such insurance policies shall
                          be prior to any such contractor's entering upon the
                          Property, the Building or the Leased Premises or
                          commencing work (if any work is scheduled to begin
                          before the Commencement Date) and (b) similar
                          certificates of insurance from each of the Tenant's
                          contractors providing for coverage in equivalent
                          amounts, together with their respective certificates
                          of workers' compensation insurance, employer's
                          liability insurance and products-completed operations
                          insurance, the latter providing coverage in at least
                          the amount required for the Tenant's comprehensive
                          general public liability and excess insurance;

                12.2.4.5. each such contractor shall be a party to collective
                          bargaining agreements with those unions that are
                          certified as the collective bargaining agents of all
                          bargaining units of such contractor, of which all such
                          contractor's workpersons shall be members in good
                          standing;

                12.2.4.6. each such contractor shall perform its work in a good
                          and workpersonlike manner and shall not interfere with
                          or hinder the Landlord or any other contractor in any
                          manner;

                12.2.4.7. there shall be no labor dispute of any nature
                          whatsoever involving any such contractor or any
                          workpersons of such contractor or the unions of which
                          they are members with anyone; and if such a labor
                          dispute exists or comes into existence the Tenant
                          shall forthwith, at the Tenant's sole cost and
                          expense, remove all such contractors and their
                          workpersons from the Building, the Common Facilities
                          and the Property; and

                12.2.4.8. the Tenant shall have the sole responsibility for the
                          security of the Leased Premises and all contractors'
                          materials, equipment and work, regardless of whether
                          their work is in progress or completed.



                                      -16-

12.3.   After the Commencement Date, the Tenant shall not apply any wall
covering (except latex based flat paint) or other treatment to the walls of the
Leased Premises without the prior written consent of the Landlord.

13.     Landlord's Rights of Entry and Access.

The Landlord and its authorized agents shall have the following rights of entry
and access to the Leased Premises:

13.1.   In case of any emergency or threatened emergency, at any time for any
purpose which the Landlord reasonably believes under such circumstances will
serve to prevent, eliminate or reduce the emergency, or the threat thereof, or
damage or threatened damage to persons and property.

13.2.   Upon at least one day's prior verbal advice to the Tenant, at any time
for the purpose of erecting or constructing improvements, modifications,
alterations and other changes to the Building or any portion thereof, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Leased Premises, the
Common Facilities or the Property or for the purpose of repairing, maintaining
or cleaning them, whether for the benefit of the Landlord, the Building, all
tenants of Other Leased Premises in the Building, or one or more tenants of
Other Leased Premises, or others. In connection with any such improvements,
modifications, alterations, other changes, repairs, maintenance or cleaning, the
Landlord may close off such portions of the Property, the Building and the
Common Facilities and interrupt such services as may be necessary to accomplish
such work, without liability to the Tenant therefor and without such closing or
interruption being deemed an eviction or constructive eviction or requiring an
abatement of Rent. However, in accomplishing any such work, the Landlord shall
endeavor not to materially interfere with the Tenant's use and enjoyment of the
Leased Premises or the conduct of the Tenant's business and to minimize
interference, inconvenience and annoyance to the Tenant.

13.3.   At all reasonable hours for the purpose of operating, inspecting or
examining the Building, including the Leased Premises, or the Property.

13.4.   At any time after the Tenant has vacated the Leased Premises, for the
purpose of preparing the Leased Premises for another tenant or prospective
tenant.

13.5.   If practicable by appointment with the Tenant, at all reasonable hours
for the purpose of showing the Building to prospective purchasers, mortgagees
and prospective mortgagees and prospective ground lessees and lessors.

13.6.   If practicable by appointment with the Tenant, at all reasonable hours
during the last nine months of the Term for the purpose of showing the Leased
Premises to prospective tenants thereof.

13.7.   The mere enumeration of any right of the Landlord within this section 13
of the Agreement shall not be deemed to create an obligation on the part of the
Landlord to exercise any such right unless the Landlord is affirmatively
required to exercise such right elsewhere in this Agreement.

14.     Liabilities and Insurance Obligations.

14.1.   The Tenant shall, at the Tenant's own expense, purchase before the
Commencement Date, and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term and
any other period during which the Tenant may have possession of the Leased
Premises, the following types of insurance coverage from financially sound and
reputable insurers, licensed by the State of New Jersey to provide such
insurance and acceptable to the Landlord, in the minimum amounts set forth
below, each of which insurance policies shall be for the benefit of, and shall
name the Landlord, the Landlord's managing agent and mortgagees and ground



                                      -17-
<PAGE>

lessors known to the Tenant, if any, of the Building, the Common Facilities, the
Property or any interest therein, their successors and assigns as additional
persons insured, and none of which insurance policies shall contain a
"co-insurance" clause:

        14.1.1. commercial general liability insurance (including "broad form
                and contractual liability" coverage) and excess ("umbrella")
                insurance which, without limiting the generality of the
                foregoing, considered together shall insure against such risks
                as bodily injury, death and property damage, with a combined
                single limit of not less than $3,000,000.00 for each occurrence;
                and

        14.1.2. "all-risks" property insurance covering the Leased Premises in
                an amount sufficient, as determined by the Landlord from time to
                time, to cover the replacement costs for all Tenant's
                alterations, improvements, fixtures and personal property
                located in or on the Leased Premises.

14.2.   With respect to risks:

        14.2.1. as to which this Agreement requires either party to maintain
                insurance, or

        14.2.2. as to which either party is effectively insured and for which
                risks the other party may be liable,

        14.2.3. the party required to maintain such insurance and the party
                effectively insured shall use its best efforts to obtain a
                clause, if available from the respective insurer, in each such
                insurance policy expressly waiving any right of recovery, by
                reason of subrogation to such party's rights or otherwise, the
                respective insurer might otherwise have or obtain against the
                other party, so long as such a clause can be obtained in the
                respective insurance policy without additional premium cost. If
                such a clause can be obtained in the respective insurance
                policy, but only at additional premium cost, such party shall,
                by notice to the other party, promptly advise the other party of
                such fact and the amount of the additional premium cost. If the
                other party desires the inclusion of such a clause in the
                notifying party's respective insurance policy, the other party
                shall, within 10 days of receipt of the notifying party's
                notice, by notice advise the notifying party of its desire and
                enclose therewith its check in the full amount of the additional
                premium cost; otherwise the notifying party need not obtain such
                a clause in the respective insurance.

14.3.   Each party hereby waives any right of recovery against the other party
for any and all damages for property losses and property damages which are
actually insured by either party, but only to the extent:

        14.3.1. that the waiver set forth in this subsection 14.3 does not cause
                or result in any cancellation of, or diminution in, the
                insurance coverage otherwise available under any applicable
                insurance policy;

        14.3.2. of the proceeds of any applicable insurance policy (without
                adjustment for any deductible amount set forth therein) actually
                received by such party for such respective loss or damages; and

        14.3.3. the substance of the clause contemplated by subsection 14.2 of
                this Agreement is actually and effectively set forth in the
                respective insurance policy.

The waiver set forth in this subsection 14.3 of the Agreement shall not apply
with respect to liability insurance policies (as opposed to property and
casualty insurance policies).




                                      -18-
<PAGE>

14.4.   The Tenant hereby waives any right of recovery it might otherwise have
against the Landlord for losses and damages caused actively or passively, in
whole or in part, by any of the risks the Tenant is required to insure against
in accordance with subsections 14.1.1 or 14.1.2 of this Agreement, unless such
waiver would cause or result in a cancellation of, or diminution in, the
coverage of the Tenant's policies of insurance against such risks.

14.5.   The Landlord shall have no liability whatsoever to the Tenant or the
Tenant's employees, other agents or Guests or anyone else for any death, bodily
injury, property loss or other damages suffered by any of them or any of their
property which is not caused directly, exclusively and entirely by the active
gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Landlord without the
intervention or contribution of any other cause or contributing factor
whatsoever.

14.6.   Each policy of insurance required under subsection 14.1 of this
Agreement shall include provisions to the effect that:

        14.6.1. no act or omission of the Tenant, its employees, other agents or
                Guests shall result in a loss of insurance coverage otherwise
                available under such policy to any person required to be named
                as an additional insured in accordance with subsection 14.1 of
                this Agreement; and

        14.6.2. the insurance coverage afforded by such policy shall not be
                diminished, cancelled, permitted to expire or otherwise
                terminated for any reason except upon 30 days' prior written
                notice from the insurer to every person required to be named as
                an additional insured in accordance with subsection 14.1 of this
                Agreement.

14.7.   With respect to each type of insurance coverage referred to in
subsection 14.1 of this Agreement, prior to the Commencement Date the Tenant
shall cause its insurer(s) to deliver to the Landlord the certificate(s) of the
insurer(s) setting forth the name and address of the insurer, the name and
address of each additional insured, the type of coverage provided, the limits of
the coverage, any deductible amounts, the effective dates of coverage and that
each policy under which coverage is provided affirmatively includes provisions
to the effect set forth in subsection 14.6 of this Agreement. In the event any
of such certificates indicates a coverage termination date earlier than the end
of the Term or the end of any other period during which the Tenant may have
possession of the Leased Premises, no later than 10 days before any such
coverage termination date, the Tenant shall deliver to the Landlord respective,
equivalent, new certificate(s) of the insurer(s).

15.     Casualty Damage to Building or Leased Premises.

15.1.   In the event of any damage to the Building or any portion thereof by
fire or other casualty, with the result that the Leased Premises are rendered
unusable, in whole or in part, then, unless the Building is destroyed or so
damaged that the Landlord does not intend to rebuild the same, the Landlord
shall, within 30 business days of the casualty, determine the period of time
required to restore the Building and the Leased Premises (but not including the
improvements constructed or installed prior to the Term or during the Term in
excess of the original allowance for the same).

        15.1.1. If, in Landlord's opinion, the restoration described above will
                take more than 180 days then either the Landlord or the Tenant
                may elect to cancel this Agreement effective as of the date of
                casualty. Notice of such election shall be served upon the other
                party within the ten-day period following the 30-business day
                period described above.

        15.1.2. If, in Landlord's opinion, the restoration described above will
                take 180 days or less, then Landlord shall not cancel this
                Agreement and must restore the Building and the Leased



                                      -19-
<PAGE>

                Premises as aforesaid. In either of such events, the Landlord
                shall cause restoration to proceed diligently and expediently to
                the extent the Landlord has received proceeds of any property,
                casualty or liability insurance on the damaged portions (or
                would have received such proceeds had it obtained such
                coverage).

15.2.   Rent shall abate from the date of the casualty until:

        15.2.1. such time as the Leased Premises are again fully usable and be
                reduced during such period by the amount which bears the same
                proportion to the Rent otherwise payable during such period as
                the gross rentable floor space of the Leased Premises which are
                rendered unusable bears to the gross rentable floor space of the
                Leased Premises. The restoration of the improvements constructed
                or installed prior to the Term or during the Term in excess of
                the original allowance for the same shall be the Tenant's
                responsibility. Tenant shall make reasonable, good faith efforts
                to integrate the restoration which is its responsibility with
                the work which is being performed by Landlord. To the extent
                that is not feasible, Tenant shall be allowed an additional,
                reasonable interval to complete its work, not to exceed sixty
                days and Rent shall abate during the interval required for such
                restoration. The Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant to
                integrate the restoration of such improvements during the
                reconstruction period; or

        15.2.2. this Agreement is canceled pursuant to the provisions of
                subsections 15.1.

15.3.   If, in the Landlord's opinion, the restoration described above will take
more than 180 days and the Landlord makes the election to cancel set forth in
subsection 15.1 above then Landlord, in such event, may proceed with restoration
(or non-restoration) in any manner it chooses, without any liability to Tenant.

15.4.   The Tenant shall promptly advise the Landlord by the quickest means of
communication of the occurrence of any casualty damage to the Building or the
Leased Premises of which the Tenant becomes aware.

16.     Condemnation.

If the Leased Premises, or any portion thereof, or the Building or the Common
Facilities, or any substantial portion of any of the foregoing, shall be
acquired for any public or quasi-public use or purpose by statute, right of
eminent domain or private sale in lieu thereof, with the result the Tenant can
not use and occupy the Leased Premises for the purpose set forth in subsection
7.1 of this Agreement, the Tenant hereby waives any claim against the Landlord,
the condemning authority or other person acquiring same for the putative value
of any leasehold interest or loss of the use of same, except for any right the
Tenant might have to make a claim, independent of, and without reference to or
having any effect on, any award or claim of the Landlord, against the condemning
authority or other acquiring party regarding the value of the Tenant's installed
trade fixtures and other installed equipment which are not removable from the
Leased Premises or for ordinary and necessary moving expenses occasioned
thereby.

17.     Assignment or Subletting by Tenant.

17.1.   Except as may be specifically set forth in this section 17 of the
Agreement, the Tenant shall not:

        17.1.1. assign, or purport to assign, this Agreement or any of the
                Tenant's rights hereunder;

        17.1.2. sublet, or purport to sublet, the Leased Premises or any portion
                thereof;



                                      -20-

        17.1.3. license, or purport to license, the use or occupancy of the
                Leased Premises or any portion thereof;

        17.1.4. otherwise transfer, or attempt to transfer any interest
                including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a
                mortgage, pledge or security interest, in this Agreement, the
                Leased Premises or the right to the use and occupancy of the
                Leased Premises; or

        17.1.5. indirectly accomplish, or permit or suffer the accomplishment
                of, any of the foregoing by merger or consolidation with another
                entity, by acquisition or disposition of assets or liabilities
                outside the ordinary course of the Tenant's business or by
                acquisition or disposition, by the Tenant's equity owners or
                subordinated creditors, of any of their respective interests in
                the Tenant.

17.2.   The Tenant shall not assign this Agreement or any of the Tenant's rights
hereunder or sublet the Leased Premises or any portion thereof without first
giving three months' prior notice to the Landlord of its desire to assign or
sublet and requesting the Landlord's consent and without first receiving the
Landlord's prior written consent. The Tenant's notice to the Landlord shall
include:

        17.2.1. the full name, address and telephone number of the proposed
                assignee or sublessee;

        17.2.2. a description of the type(s) of business in which the proposed
                assignee or sublessee is engaged and proposes to engage;

        17.2.3. a description of the precise use to which the proposed assignee
                or sublessee intends to put the Leased Premises or portion
                thereof;

        17.2.4. the proposed assignee's or subtenant's most recent quarterly and
                annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
                generally accepted accounting principles and any other evidence
                of financial position and responsibility that the Tenant or
                proposed assignee or sublessee may desire to submit;

        17.2.5. by diagram and measurement of the actual square feet of floor
                space, the precise portion of the Leased Premises proposed to be

                given, or proposed to be paid or to be given, by the proposed
                assignee, sublessee or other person to the Tenant and the
                respective times of payment or delivery; and

        17.2.7. any other information reasonably requested by the Landlord.

17.3.   By the expiration of the notice period contemplated by subsection 17.2
of this Agreement, the Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall take one of the
following actions by notice to the Tenant:

        17.3.1. grant consent on the terms and conditions set forth in
                subsection 17.4 of this Agreement and such other reasonable
                terms and conditions set forth in the Landlord's notice;

        17.3.2. refuse to grant consent for any of the reasons set forth in

                Term would have expired (had there been no election to terminate

                Year, the sum of Base Year Taxes and Base Year Operational
                Expenses shall be assumed to be $7.50 per gross rentable square

                Landlord (and not paid by the Tenant) in building out the Leased
                Premises in accordance with section 5 of this Agreement as the
                number of months remaining in the Term (immediately before the
                occurrence of the Event of Default) bears to the number of
                months in the entire Term (immediately before the occurrence of
                the Event of Default).

23.3.   In the event the Landlord elects the right and remedy set forth in

Leased Premises to, any such lessee.

23.4.   In the event the Landlord elects the right and remedy set forth in
subsection 23.1.3 of this Agreement, Holdover Damages shall mean damages at the

                of demand for removal therefrom, of the cause therefor, to
                cease, to quit and all other notices that might otherwise be
                required pursuant to 2A N.J.S.A. 18-53 et seq.; and

        23.5.2. any right the Tenant might otherwise have to appeal any judgment
                awarding possession of the Leased Premises to the Landlord.

Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive of any rights and
remedies which might otherwise be available to the Landlord, or to force an

remedy enumerated in this section 23 of the Agreement is intended to be
cumulative with each other right and remedy enumerated in this section 23 of the
Agreement and with each other right and remedy that might otherwise be available
to the Landlord; and the selection of one or more of such rights and remedies at
any time shall not be deemed to prevent resort to one or more others of such
rights and remedies at the same time or a subsequent time, even with regard to
the same occurrence sought to be remedied.

23.7.   It is expressly understood and agreed that the Landlord shall have no
duty to mitigate damages except to appoint a nationally recognized real estate
broker to re-let the Leased Premises. In the event the Landlord elects the right
and remedy set forth in subsection 23.1.2 of this Agreement, Re-Leasing Damages
shall be equal to the Rent less any rent actually and timely received by the
Landlord from any lessee of the Leased Premises or any portion thereof, payable
at the respective times that Rent is payable under the Agreement plus the cost,
if any, to the Landlord of building out or otherwise preparing the Leased
Premises for, and leasing the Leased Premises to, any such lessee.

23.8.   If (i) an Event of Default has occurred and the Tenant moves out,
whether Landlord has terminated or otherwise, or (ii) if Tenant is dispossessed,
and, in either of such events, fails to remove any property, machinery,
equipment and fixtures or other property prior to such default, dispossess or
removal, then and in that event, the said property, machinery, equipment and
fixtures or other property shall be deemed, at the option of the Landlord, to be
abandoned; or in lieu thereof, at the Landlord's option, the Landlord may remove
such property and charge the reasonable cost and expense of removal, storage and
disposal to the Tenant, together with an additional twenty one (21%) percent of
such costs for Landlord's overhead and profit, which total costs shall be deemed
to be additional rent hereunder. The Tenant shall be liable for any damage which
it causes in the removal of said property from the Leased Premises.

24.     Termination of the Term.

24.1.   The Term shall terminate upon the earliest of the following events to
occur:

        24.1.1. expiration of the Term;

        24.1.2. in connection with a transaction contemplated by section 16 of
                this Agreement, the later of (a) the vesting of the acquiring
                party's right to possession or (b) the Tenant's vacating the
                Leased Premises;

        24.1.3. under the circumstances contemplated by subsection 15.1 of this
                Agreement, upon the Tenant's giving prompt notice of the failure
                of the Landlord to give, on a timely basis, the notice
                contemplated by subsection 15.1.2 of this Agreement and that the
                Tenant desires termination of the Term (which termination shall
                be effective as of the date of the subject casualty with respect
                to those portions of the Leased Premises rendered untenantable
                and as of the date of the Tenant's giving notice with respect to
                those portions of the Leased Premises which were not rendered
                untenantable);

        24.1.4. under the circumstances contemplated by subsection 15.1 of this
                Agreement, upon the expiration of 20 additional days (without
                the Landlord's completion of restoration in the



                                      -28-
<PAGE>

                interim) after the Tenant shall have given prompt notice that
                the Landlord has not restored the Leased Premises on a timely
                basis and that the Tenant desires termination of the Term (which
                termination shall be effective as of the date of the subject
                casualty with respect to those portions of the Leased Premises
                rendered untenantable and as of the date of the Tenant's giving
                notice with respect to those portions of the Leased Premises
                which were not rendered untenantable);

        24.1.5. the effective date of any election by the Landlord under
                subsection 17.3.3 of this Agreement in response to the Tenant's
                notice of the Tenant's desire to assign this Agreement or to
                sublet all or a portion of the Leased Premises; provided,
                however, that the Tenant has not revoked its request to assign
                or sublease as therein provided;

        24.1.6. the effective date of any election by the Landlord to terminate
                the Term under subsection 23.1.1 of this Agreement; or

        24.1.7. the effective date of any notice exercising the Termination
                Option granted to Tenant under subsection 6.4 of this Agreement.

24.2.   No termination of the Term shall have the effect of releasing the Tenant
from any obligation or liability theretofore or thereby incurred and, until the
Tenant shall have surrendered the Leased Premises in accordance with section 21
of this Agreement, from any obligation or liability thereafter incurred.

25.     Mortgage and Underlying Lease Priority.

25.1.   This Agreement and the estate, interest and rights hereby created for
the benefit of the Tenant are, and shall always be, subordinate to any mortgage
(other than a mortgage created by the Tenant or a sale, transfer or other
disposition by the Tenant in the nature of a security interest in violation of
subsections 17.1.4 and 22.5, respectively, of this Agreement) already or
afterwards placed on the Property, the Common Facilities, the Building or any
estate or interest therein including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any new mortgage or any mortgage extension, renewal, modification,
consolidation, replacement, supplement or substitution. This Agreement and the
estate, interest and rights hereby created for the benefit of the Tenant are,
and shall always be, subordinate to any ground lease already or afterwards made
with regard to the Property, the Common Facilities, the Building or any estate
or interest therein including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
any new ground lease or any ground lease extension, renewal, modification,
consolidation, replacement, supplement or substitution. The provisions of this
section 25 of the Agreement shall be self-effecting; and no further instrument
shall be necessary to effect any such subordination. Nevertheless, the Tenant
hereby consents that any mortgagee or mortgagee's successor in interest may, at
any time and from time to time, by notice to the Tenant, subordinate its
mortgage to the estate and interest created by this Agreement; and upon the
giving of such notice, the subject mortgage shall be deemed subordinate to the
estate and interest created by this Agreement regardless of the respective times
of execution or delivery of either or of recording the subject mortgage.

25.2.   Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure a
non-disturbance agreement in mortgagee's standard form which provides that
Tenant's possession will not be disturbed as long as Tenant is not in default
under the terms of the Agreement.

26.     Transfer by Landlord.

26.1.   The Landlord shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of the Property, the Common
Facilities or the Building or any of the Landlord's interests therein, or to
assign this Agreement or any of the Landlord's rights thereunder.



                                      -29-

26.2.   Upon giving notice of the occurrence of any transaction contemplated by
subsection 26.1 of this Agreement, the Landlord shall thereby be relieved of any
obligation that might otherwise exist under this Agreement with respect to
periods subsequent to the effective date of any such transaction. If, in
connection with any transaction contemplated by subsection 26.1 of this
Agreement the Landlord transfers, or makes allowance for, any Security Deposit
of the Tenant and gives notice of that fact to the Tenant, the Landlord shall
thereby be relieved of any further obligation to the Tenant with regard to any
such Security Deposit; and the Tenant shall look solely to the transferee with
respect to any such Security Deposit.

26.3.   In the event of the occurrence of any transaction contemplated by
subsection 26.1 of this Agreement the Tenant, upon written request therefor from
the transferee, shall attorn to and become the tenant of such transferee upon
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

26.4.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth in
subsections 26.1, 26.2 and 26.3 of this Agreement, in the event any mortgage
contemplated by section 25 of this Agreement is enforced by the respective
mortgagee pursuant to remedies provided in the mortgage or otherwise provided by
law or equity and any person succeeds to the interest of the Landlord as a
result of, or in connection with, any such enforcement, the Tenant shall, upon
the request of such successor in interest, automatically attorn to and become
the Tenant of such successor in interest without any change in the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, except that such successor in interest shall not
be bound by: (a) any payment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent (exclusive of
prepayments in the nature of a Security Deposit) for more than one month in
advance or (b) any amendment or other modification of this Agreement which was
made without the consent of such mortgagee or such successor in interest; and,
upon the request of such successor in interest, the Tenant shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver any instrument(s) confirming such attornment.

26.5.   If this Agreement and the estate, interest and rights hereby created for
the benefit of the Tenant are ever subject and subordinate to any ground lease
contemplated by section 25 of this Agreement:

        26.5.1. upon the expiration or earlier termination of the term of any
                such ground lease before the termination of the Term under this
                Agreement, the Tenant shall attorn to, and become the Tenant of,
                the lessor under any such ground lease and recognize such lessor
                as the Landlord under this Agreement for the balance of the
                Term; and

        26.5.2. such expiration or earlier termination of the term of any such
                ground lease shall have no effect on the Term under this
                Agreement.

27.     Indemnification.

27.1.   The Tenant shall, and hereby does, indemnify the Landlord against any
and all liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, claims, costs, charges and
expenses including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, expenses
of investigation, defense and enforcement thereof or of the obligation set forth
in this section 27 of the Agreement including, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, attorneys' fees, imposed on or incurred by the Landlord in
connection with any of the following matters which occurs during the Term:

        27.1.1. any matter, cause or thing arising out of the use, occupancy,
                control or management of the Leased Premises or any portion
                thereof which is not caused directly, exclusively and entirely
                by the Landlord's active gross negligence or intentional act
                without the intervention of any other cause or contributing
                factor whatsoever;

        27.1.2. any negligence or intentional act on the part of the Tenant or
                any of its employees, other agents or Guests;

        27.1.4. any representation made by the Tenant in this Agreement shall
                have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect

                made;

        27.1.5. the imposition of any mechanic's, materialman's or other lien on
                the Property, the Common Facilities, the Building, the Leased

                of any notice of intention to obtain any such lien, in
                connection with any alteration, improvement or other
                modification of the Leased Premises made or authorized by the
                Tenant (which indemnification obligation shall be deemed to
                include the Tenant's obligations set forth in subsection
                12.2.4.3 of this Agreement); or

        27.1.6. any failure on the part of the Tenant to perform or comply with
                any obligation of the Tenant set forth in this Agreement.

27.2.   The Landlord shall, and hereby does, indemnify the Tenant against any

providing indemnification. The other party shall not be bound by any compromise
or settlement of any such claim, action or proceeding without its prior written
consent.

28.     Parties' Liability.

28.1.   None of the following occurrences shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the Landlord, a termination of the Term, an active or constructive

                to be provided by the Landlord, as described in section 8 of
                this Agreement which is due to causes beyond the Landlord's
                control, or to necessary or advisable improvements, maintenance,
                repairs or emergency, so long as the Landlord uses reasonable

perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement if such failure has
caused loss or damage that can not promptly be cured by subsequent act of the

32.4.   Approximately (i) 90 days prior to the termination of the Term and (ii)
30 days prior to any relocation of the Tenant from the Leased Premises (as
constituted on the Commencement Date), the Tenant shall obtain from the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP"), and deliver to the
Landlord, the Department's unconditional certificate of non-applicability or
approval of the Tenant's negative declaration or clean-up plan, together with
copies of all documents furnished to NJDEP in connection with obtaining such
certificate or approval.

32.5.   In the event evidence of compliance with ISRA is not delivered to the
Landlord prior to expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant shall be
liable for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in enforcing Tenant's
obligations hereunder until such time as evidence of compliance with ISRA has
been delivered to the Landlord, and together with any costs and expenses,
including legal and environmental consultant fees incurred by Landlord in

the Tenant shall remain liable for the payment of the annual rent in effect in
the last month of the Term, prorated on a monthly basis (the "Post-Term Rent").

32.4 of this Agreement at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the Term then

action on the part of the NJDEP, evidence of compliance is obtained from the
NJDEP or from and after the commencement date of a lease of the Leased Premises
to a third party.

33.     Waiver of Jury Trial and Arbitration.

Agreement or the use and occupancy of the Leased Premises; and they hereby
consent to arbitration of any such dispute in Somerset County, New Jersey, in
accordance with the rules for commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration
Association or successor organization, except that the Landlord, in its sole
discretion, may, with respect to any dispute involving either (i) the Landlord's
right to re-enter and re-take possession of the Leased Premises or (ii) the
determination of money damages following the occurrence of an Event of Default
under this Agreement, elect to pursue any of or all its rights in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

34.     Severability.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any
provision in any instance, shall be conclusively determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such
determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the balance of
this Agreement.

<PAGE>

condition or breach, or as a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of
any other term, covenant, representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement. The Landlord's acceptance of, or endorsement on, any partial payment
of Rent or any late payment of Rent from the Tenant shall not operate as a
waiver of the Landlord's right to the balance of the Rent due on a timely basis
regardless of any writing to the contrary on, or accompanying, the Tenant's
partial payment or the Landlord's putative acquiescence therein.

43.     Course of Performance.

No course of dealing or performance by the parties, or any of them, shall be
admissible for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation or construction of

any amount otherwise due from the Tenant in accordance with subsection 5.4 of
this Agreement an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $375,760 or (ii) such amount
as is otherwise due from the Tenant in accordance with subsection 5.4 of this
Agreement (the "Allowance").

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the date first above written.

22.     The Landlord reserves the right not to enforce any Building Rule or
Regulation against any tenants of Other Leased Premises. The Landlord reserves

reputation, safety, care or appearance of the Building or the preservation of
good order therein or the operation of the Building or the comfort of tenants or
others in the Building. No rescission, amendment or waiver of any Building Rule
