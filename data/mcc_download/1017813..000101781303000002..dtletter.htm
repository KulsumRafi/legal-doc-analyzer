<P>Dear Roger:</P><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We are writing this letter
to document our commitment to raise with appropriate investors or, if necessary,
invest personally the moneys needed to fund PATI&#146;s operations through the
end of 2003. As of the date of this agreement $300,000 has already been provided
to fund PATI&#146;s operations. The terms under which these monies will be
advanced are subject to final negotiation between the Board of Directors and the
investors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>This commitment is valid
for 2003 and expires as of January 1, 2004. Roger, as you know, we have a
significant amount of capital invested in Patient InfoSystems (in excess of $7
million combined) and we will do whatever is needed to raise the additional
capital necessary to help the company succeed and prosper. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Please contact either of us
if you have any questions. </FONT></P>
