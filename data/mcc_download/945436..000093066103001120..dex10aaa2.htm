face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">SECTION 11. <U>Securities Act, etc</U>. In view of the position of the Pledgors in relation to the Pledged Securities, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the
Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "<U>Federal Securities Laws</U>")
with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Securities permitted hereunder. Each Pledgor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Collateral Agent if the Collateral Agent
were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Securities could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other
legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Coll eral Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Securities under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Pledgor
recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Collateral Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Pledged Securities, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Pledged Securities for
their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion,
(a)&nbsp;may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b)&nbsp;may approach and negotiate
with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale, in either case in accordance with a v alid exemption from registration under the Federal Securities Laws. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other
terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Securities
at a price that the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem </font></P> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">8 of 18</font></P>

prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Collateral Agent sells.</font></p> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">SECTION 12. <U>Registration, etc</U>. Each Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, if for any reason the Collateral Agent desires to sell any of the Pledged Securities at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent, use
its reasonable best efforts to take or to cause the issuer of such Pledged Securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Collateral Agent
to permit the public sale of such Pledged Securities. Each Pledgor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, each other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, affiliates and
controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses to the Collateral Agent o legal counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they
may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering
circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue
statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Pledgor or the issuer of such Pledged Securities by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. Each Pledgor further agrees, upon such written
request referred to above, to use its reasonable best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the issuer of such Pledged Securities to qualify, file or register, any of the Pledged Securities under th e Blue Sky or other securities laws of
such states as may be requested by the Collateral Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. Each Pledgor will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this
Section&nbsp;12. Each Pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it to comply with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;12 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees
