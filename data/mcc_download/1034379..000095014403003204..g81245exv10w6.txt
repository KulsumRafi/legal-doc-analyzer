                  4. Representations and Warranties. To induce the Holders to
execute and deliver this First Amendment, the Company hereby reaffirms all
covenants, representations, and warranties made in the Investment Agreement and
the other Investment Documents to the extent the same are not amended hereby and
agree that all such covenants, representations, and warranties shall be deemed
to have been remade as of the date of this Amendment. Any such representations
and warranties made as of the Closing Date shall be made as of the date hereof.
Any default by the Company in its warranties and representations made in this
Amendment shall constitute an additional Event of Default under the Investment
Agreement, as amended hereby.

                  5. Joinder. Each of Blue Rhino Consumer Products, LLC and
Uniflame, LLC (the "New Credit Parties") hereby joins the Investment Agreement
and the Debentures as a joint and several obligor thereunder and party thereto,
subject to the terms and provisions thereof. Each New Credit Party hereby
unconditionally and expressly agrees to become, by execution and delivery of
this Agreement does become, and assumes, jointly and severally, each and every
one of the obligations of, a "Borrower" under and as defined in the Investment
Agreement and the Debentures. In addition, each New Credit Party makes each and
every representation and warranty of a Borrower set forth in the Investment
Agreement as of the date hereof except for those representations and warranties
that relate to a prior date. Without limitation of the foregoing or of anything
in the Investment Agreement or the Debentures, by such execution and delivery
hereof each New Credit Party does become fully, jointly and severally liable, as
a Borrower, for the payment of the Obligations as defined in the Investment
Agreement and the Debentures. As provided for in Section 7.8(a) of the
Investment Agreement, each New Credit Party joins as a Borrower under the
Investment Agreement as if such New Credit Party had been an original party to
the Investment Agreement and the Debentures. Each New Credit Party agrees to
cooperate with the Holders and execute such further instruments and documents as
the Holders shall reasonably request to effect, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Holders, the purposes hereof.

                  6. Consent. The Holders hereby consent to the execution and
delivery of the New Credit Agreement and each of the Loan Documents (as defined
herein) by the Borrowers and acknowledge that the Indebtedness evidenced thereby
does not constitute a "Covered Financing" under Section 6.13. The Holders
further acknowledge that the execution and delivery thereof shall not constitute
a violation of Section 7.15 of the Investment Agreement. The parties hereto
understand and agree that this consent shall be effective only with respect to
the New Credit Agreement executed and delivered on the date hereof and only with
respect to Sections 6.13 and 7.15 of the Investment Agreement. This consent
shall not be deemed to constitute a consent to or waiver of any other term,
provision or condition of the Investment Agreement or to prejudice any right or
remedy that the Holders may now have or may have in the future under or in
connection with any of the Investment Documents.

                  7. Acknowledgments by the Borrowers. The Borrowers acknowledge
and agree with the Holders that as of the date hereof, the aggregate principal
amount of the Obligations owing by the Borrowers to Allied under the Investment
Agreement is $15,000,000, and all such Obligations are due and owing by the
Borrowers to Allied in accordance with the Investment Documents and without any
defense, deduction, offset, or counterclaim of any nature (all of which are
hereby waived).

waiver of any provision of the Investment Agreement or the other Investment
Documents.

hereof, the Borrowers shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by

fulfilled all of its obligations under the Investment Agreement and hereby
release and forever discharge the Holders and their representatives, agents,
employees, attorneys, successors, directors, officers, parents, affiliates,
assigns, and subsidiaries (collectively the "Released Parties") of, to, and from
any and all claims, defenses, actions, causes of action, suits, controversies,
agreements, provisions, and demands in law or in equity, known or unknown

such supersede any prior agreements, whether written or oral, regarding the
matters described herein.

                  (b) No Oral Modification or Waivers. The terms herein may not
be modified or waived orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the
party against which enforcement of the modification or waiver (as the case may
be) is sought.

                  (c) Governing Law. This First Amendment is governed by, and
interpreted and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of
Maryland (without regard to its conflicts of law principles).

any applicable law, that provision shall be considered void and the balance of
this First Amendment shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

                  (f) Counterparts. This First Amendment may be executed in as
many counterpart copies as may be required. It shall not be necessary that the
signature of, or on behalf of, each party appear on each counterpart, but it
shall be sufficient that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party appear on
one or more of the counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute
a single agreement. It shall not be necessary in any proof of this First
Amendment to produce or account for more than a number of counterparts
containing the respective signatures of, or on behalf of, all of the parties.
