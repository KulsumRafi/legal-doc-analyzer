     such Quarter;

          (b)  sixty-seven (67) days prior to the first day of each Quarter,
     advise NAC and Processor NSC's non-binding good faith estimate of the
     amount of Available Line Time that NSC expects to use during such Quarter,

to process NSC Steel pursuant to Section 3.2 above will be deemed to have been
satisfied through a combination of:

          (a)  actual use of and payment for such portion of the Available Line
     Time by NSC and its Affiliates; and

          (b)  to the extent that Committed Line Time is not used by NSC or its

<PAGE>

     parties Hours of Committed Line Time that are not used by NSC or its
     Affiliates and also is offering for sale to third parties Hours of
     Available Line Time that NAC is obligated to pay for under the Two Party
     TPA but which NAC and its Affiliates will not use, NAC may sell the Hours
     of Available Line Time that NAC is obligated to pay for under the Two Party
     TPA but which NAC and its Affiliates will not use before NAC sells any
     Hours of Committed Line Time that are not used by NSC or its Affiliates.

     3.4  In the event that NSC and its Affiliates elect to use less than the
Maximum NSC Line Time for any Month, the Hours of Available Line Time
constituting the difference between 50% of Available Line Time and Committed
Line Time for such Month shall be governed by the provisions of Article Ten of
the Two Party TPA relating to Dofasco's right of first refusal. If Dofasco
elects affirmatively not to exercise its right of first refusal under Article
Ten of the Two Party TPA or, by the end of the fifteenth (15th) day after
receipt of the Offer, Dofasco has not exercised such right of first refusal to
use the Hours which constitute such difference, NAC will notify NSC to that
effect (on the next Business Day following such affirmative election by Dofasco
or on the next Business Day after the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt of the
Offer, as the case may be), and NSC shall thereupon have the option to notify
NAC and Processor (the "Additional Line Time Notice") that NSC and/or its
Affiliates will use some or all of such Hours to process NSC Steel. Upon the
delivery to NAC and Processor of an Additional Line Time Notice, and subject to
the next sentence, the amount of additional line time identified by NSC in the
Additional Line Time Notice shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement
to be Committed Line Time (in addition to any Hours previously included as
Committed Line Time in the Scheduling Notice for that Month). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the amount of such additional line time which is the subject
of Additional Line Time Notices during any Quarter, when added to the amount of
Committed Line Time set forth in the Scheduling Notices for the three Months
which constitute that Quarter, cannot exceed the Maximum NSC Line Time
applicable to that Quarter, (ii) no Additional Line Time Notice can be sent in
respect of any line time as to which NAC has entered into an agreement to sell
to a third party which is not an Affiliate of NAC, and (iii) any Additional Line
Time Notice must be delivered by NSC to Processor and NAC no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the Month to which such Additional Line Time Notice applies.

                                 TITLE AND RISK

     7.1  Title and risk of loss or damage to all Steel delivered by a Customer
for processing shall remain at all times with such Customer subject to
compliance by Processor with the provisions of this Article and to Processor's
liabilities herein.

     7.2  Processor shall be obligated to inspect all Steel upon receipt thereof
and to notify Customer and its carrier of any damage or loss which occurred
during transit and shall, if so requested by Customer, co-operate with Customer
in filing and expediting any claims against a carrier for loss or damage.

     7.3  Processor shall be liable for any demurrage, detention or other delay
charges incurred in connection with deliveries of Steel to the Facilities for
processing unless such charges arise from deliveries being made in excess of
scheduled deliveries.

     7.4  Processor shall promptly and properly unpack and inspect in accordance
with the Customer Manuals all Steel delivered for processing. The commencement
of processing of any Steel shall constitute Processor's representation that such
Steel is not damaged or defective, unless such damage or defect could not have
been discovered in the course of a reasonably diligent inspection by Processor
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Customer Manual. Damaged or
defective Steel shall be set aside in a safe and suitable location for
examination by Customer. Processor shall follow Customer's instructions with
respect to any Steel which Customer accepts as being damaged, defective or
otherwise unsuitable for processing. Steel rejected by Processor shall be
considered "prime" and will remain "prime" until Customer has notified Processor
of material disposition. Without limitation of the foregoing requirements,
Processor shall comply with the more detailed requirements of the quality and
claims procedures set out in the Customer Manual and any Applicable Policy.

                 NSC'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

     9.1  NSC, at the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Date,
represents and warrants to and covenants with:

          (a)  NAC and Processor that all Steel delivered by NSC and its
     Affiliates for toll coating by the Facilities will be suitable for the
     processing of Products by the Facilities;

          (b)  Dofasco, NAC and Processor that neither the entering into of this

                                   ARTICLE TEN

                                    LIABILITY

     10.1 Processor shall take all reasonable steps to avoid damage or loss to
Steel while in Processor's possession. NSC (which for purposes of this Section
10.1 shall be deemed to include any Affiliate of NSC) and the other parties
hereto acknowledge that the standard yield loss for 2003 shall be determined as
part of the annual budget for 2003 for DNN, as to which budget NSC will consult
(the "Yield Loss"), and further acknowledge that, following the conclusion of
each Month, the Yield Loss will be adjusted for such Month based on the product
mix for such Month (the "Adjusted Yield Loss"). With respect to any damage to or
loss of NSC Steel in any Month in excess of the Adjusted Yield Loss or which is
the subject of a product liability claim by NSC, NSC shall be reimbursed as
follows: (i) if at least a portion of the damage or loss is covered by
Processor's then current insurance coverage, by (a) payment from the relevant
insurer in the ordinary course to the extent of coverage, and (b) payment from
NAC concurrently with the payment referenced in (a) in the amount of any
applicable deductible; and (ii) if at least a portion of the damage or loss is
not covered by Processor's then current insurance coverage, either (a) through
supplemental insurance coverage obtained at NAC's sole cost, in which case
payment shall be made in the same manner as in clause (i) above, and/or (b) by
payment of any uninsured portion of such damage or loss directly by NAC within
thirty (30) days of the notice of claim referenced below. NAC agrees to
reimburse DNN for any additional costs incurred by DNN as a consequence of any
claim for damage to or loss of NSC Steel in accordance herewith, including
increases in the costs incurred by DNN in obtaining insurance. The parties agree
that if NSC Steel is coated by DNN in a manner other than as required in the
applicable Work Order and the resulting Product is rejected by NSC's customer,
the costs incurred by NSC in connection therewith (such as loss in the value of
the damaged or lost NSC Steel (measured as the lesser of net replacement cost or
rework cost or in such other manner as the parties may agree), freight charges
incurred in connection with shipping the Product to and from the customer and/or
to other processors and/or final destination, freight costs incurred in shipping
material to Processor, duties for the originally intended order, and reasonable
fees paid to another party to rework the defective material) shall be included
in NSC's damages and losses for purposes of this Section 10.1. In all cases, any
claim by NSC for damage to or loss of NSC Steel shall be made by notice to NAC
and to Processor and accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation. For
purposes of this Section 10.1, the phrase "damage to or loss of NSC Steel" shall
exclude all indirect, consequential, punitive and special damages and exclude
any damage to or loss of Scrap. NSC shall have no ability to make a claim under
this Section 10.1 as to any of its Steel which has damaged the Facilities. The
procedures to be followed under this Section 10.1 shall be those in the
Applicable Policy; provided that in the case of any conflict between this
Section 10.1 and any Applicable Policy, the provisions of this Section 10.1
shall prevail.

     10.2 NSC shall indemnify and hold NAC harmless from any damage to the
Facilities resulting solely from defects in Steel delivered by NSC to Processor
for processing at the

                                       13

<PAGE>

Facilities. NSC agrees not to hold NAC liable in the event NSC is unable to
access the Facilities for any reason whatsoever which is reasonably beyond the
control of NAC or its Affiliates.

     10.3 The remedies contained in Section 10.1 shall constitute Customer's
sole remedies for damaged or lost Steel and for defective Product. For greater
certainty, it is hereby agreed that no party shall have any liability to another
pursuant to this Agreement for indirect or consequential damages of any nature,
however caused.

                                 ARTICLE ELEVEN

                                  FORCE MAJEURE

     11.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, a Force Majeure Event shall mean
Acts of God, wars, riots, fires, explosions, breakdowns or accidents; strikes,
lockouts or other labor difficulties; lack or shortages of labor, materials,
utilities, energy sources or transportation facilities; equipment failures;
delays of carriers; compliance with governmental rules, regulations, priorities,
allocations or other governmental requirements (including, without limitation,
environmental regulations); and any other causes beyond the reasonable control
of Processor or NSC, as the case may be; provided that (1) the occurrence or
cause in question shall have continued for a period of not less than ninety-six
(96) consecutive hours before it constitutes a Force Majeure Event, (2) the
party so prevented (or to be prevented) from performing shall give prompt
written notice to the other party of the nature and probable duration of such
Force Majeure Event, and of the extent of its effects of such party's
performance hereunder, (3) each party shall, in the event it experiences a Force
Majeure Event, make all reasonable efforts to remove such disability as soon as
possible (except for a Force Majeure Event resulting from a labor dispute, the
removal of which shall be solely within the affected party's discretion), and
(4) a Force Majeure Event shall, subject to the foregoing, be deemed for the
purposes of this Agreement to have commenced at the beginning of the period
specified in clause (1).

     11.2 In the event of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event the existence
of which (a) prevents Processor from making available Available Line Time to
NSC, or (b) prevents NSC from making use of all or any part of its Committed
Line Time in respect of any Applicable Time Period, NSC shall be under no
obligation for the duration of such Force Majeure Event to pay Processor or NAC
for any Committed Line Time not in fact made available to NSC and its Affiliates
as a result of such Force Majeure Event.

                                 ARTICLE TWELVE

                                      TERM

     12.1 Subject to Sections 12.2 and 12.3, assuming (i) no Matured Default (as
defined in the Amended Current TPA) has occurred prior to the Effective Date and
(ii) the Amended Current TPA has not been terminated pursuant to Section 14.4
thereof, the Term of this Agreement shall commence at the beginning of business
at the Facilities on the Effective Date and expire at the close of business at
the Facilities on December 31, 2003.

     12.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1 and subject to Section
12.3, the term of this Agreement shall expire on the earlier (if prior to
December 31, 2003) of (i) the date on which NSC fails to make any payment
payable to Processor when due under this Agreement, which failure has continued
for a period of five (5) Business Days after notice thereof by NAC, Processor or
Dofasco to NSC (provided that if the payment is disputed by NSC in good faith,
the date shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business Days during which
the parties will endeavor in good faith to resolve such dispute), and (ii) one
hundred eighty (180) days after (A) the entry of an order terminating all
proceedings in connection with Case No. 02-08699 (captioned In re: National
Steel Corporation et al., Debtors) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, (B) the date on which NKK (or
its successor) ceases to have beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
Schedule 13D promulgated under the United States Securities Exchange Act of
1934) of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding voting capital stock
of NSC by reason of an order of the U.S. bankruptcy court having jurisdiction
over NSC confirming a plan of reorganization, or (C) an asset sale of
substantially all of the assets of NSC and its subsidiaries by reason of an
order of the United States Bankruptcy Court having jurisdiction over NSC
confirming a plan of reorganization; provided that NSC may at its election and
in its sole discretion terminate this Agreement during the aforesaid one hundred
eighty (180) days following the occurrence of any of the events described in
(A), (B) and (C) by providing notice of such an election to NAC, Dofasco and DNN
at least sixty-seven (67) days prior to the date such election is to become
effective.

     12.3 Notwithstanding Sections 12.1 and 12.2, this Agreement may be
terminated by NSC or NAC at its option in the event of the destruction of the
Facilities, which term shall mean that the Facilities have been destroyed
completely or have suffered damage which is such that the Facilities cannot be
rebuilt or repaired so as to be usable within a period of sixty (60) days (it
being understood and agreed that, in case of damage or partial destruction, the
provisions of Article Eleven shall apply).

                                ARTICLE THIRTEEN

                                     GENERAL

     13.1 Except for the ability of NAC to assign its rights and delegate its

                                    EXHIBIT A

The payments to be made by NSC for Toll Processing Services performed by
Processor for NSC and its Affiliates and in satisfaction of NSC's Take or Pay
Obligations shall be calculated as follows.

Hourly Rate and Other Charges for Line Time:

a)   The rate per Hour for line time (the "Hourly Rate") has been determined
prior to January 1, 2003, based on the budgeted variable cost of running the
Facilities utilizing formulae in use at the time of execution of this Agreement,
and shall be the same rate as is charged to Dofasco and NAC by Processor for use
of Available Line Time. The budget will be reviewed with NSC and comments from
NSC will be included in revising the budget if appropriate.

b)   NSC will be invoiced weekly by Processor for Hourly Rate charges for
Available Line Time used by NSC and its Affiliates for processing each coil of
NSC Steel when shipped from Processor.

c)   NSC will be invoiced monthly by Processor for Hourly Rate charges for the
number of Hours of Committed Line Time in excess of the number of Hours of
Available Line Time actually used by NSC or its Affiliates during such Month,
provided however that, for these purposes, Committed Line Time shall be reduced
to reflect any Hours of Committed Line Time not used by NSC or its Affiliates
but which are used by NAC or Dofasco (or the Affiliates of either of them) or
which are sold by NAC as contemplated in Subsection 3.3(b). Such adjusted
Committed Line Time is referred to in this Exhibit A as Adjusted Committed Line
Time.

d)   NSC will be invoiced weekly by Processor for coating oil charges applicable
to coils of Steel shipped during such week.

Fixed Costs:

a)   An administrative fee (the "Administrative Fee") will be determined prior
to January 1, 2003, based on the budgeted cost of running the Facilities, and
shall be determined on the same basis and in the same manner as the
administrative fee charged to Dofasco and NAC by Processor.

b)   NSC will be invoiced monthly by Processor for the Administrative Fee for
each Month based on the ratio of Adjusted Committed Line Time for such Month to
the Available Line Time during such Month.

c)   NSC will be invoiced by NAC in May 2003 US$1,271,527.93 in respect of Debt
Costs (as defined in the Two Party TPA) and invoiced in November 2003
US$1,239,727.45 in respect of Debt Costs. Such amounts were calculated assuming
NSC would use twenty-five percent (25%) of Available Line Time during each Month
of calendar year 2003, it being understood that such assumption was made solely
for purposes of determining the amount to be set forth in the

                                       19

<PAGE>

aforesaid invoices, and the amount set forth in such invoices if twenty-five
percent (25%) of all Debt Costs due for the period covered thereby. In the event
the Agreement terminates before an invoice date, NSC shall nevertheless be
obligated to pay a pro rated portion of the invoice amount based on the ratio of
(A) the number of days during 2003 which the Agreement was in effect to (B) 365,
and the obligation of NSC to pay the pro rated portion of the invoice shall
survive the termination of the Agreement. No later than April 30, 2004, NAC and
NSC will recalculate NSC's portion of Debt Costs utilizing the Adjusted
Committed Line Time for the calendar year 2003 (the "Recalculated Debt Cost
Obligation") for purposes of such calculation and NSC shall pay to NAC or NAC
shall pay to NSC (as the case may be) such amounts as are necessary to reconcile
the aggregate amount paid by NSC in respect of Debt Costs (including the amounts
paid in connection with the May invoice and the November invoice and the Rate
Differential calculations set forth in Exhibit B to the Two Party TPA) with the
Recalculated Debt Cost Obligation. The obligation to reconcile the Debt Cost
payments shall survive termination of the Agreement.

d)   NSC will be invoiced following the close of calendar year 2003 for its
proportionate share of RONE Costs and ROFE Costs (each as defined in Exhibit B
