extent of the aggregate amount of the Competitive  Loans then  outstanding,  and
such deemed use of the Total  Commitment shall be applied to the Lenders ratably
according  to their  respective  Commitments.  Within the  foregoing  limits and
subject to the terms and  conditions  set forth herein,  the Company may borrow,
prepay and reborrow Committed Loans.

<PAGE>

increase their respective Commitments;  provided however (i) no Default or Event
of Default  shall have  occurred  hereunder  which is  continuing,  (ii) no such
increase  shall  cause  (A)  the  aggregate   Commitments  hereunder  to  exceed
$600,000,000,  or (B) the sum of the aggregate  Commitments  hereunder  plus the
aggregate   commitments   under  the   Related   Credit   Agreement   to  exceed
$1,100,000,000, and (iii) no Lender's Commitment shall be increased without such
Lender's consent.

          (c) All Committed Loans which are outstanding on the Termination  Date
are due and payable,  together with accrued interest thereon, on the Termination
Date unless Company exercises its option to convert such Loans to term loans and
extend  the  maturity  date  of  such  Loans  to the  date  which  is the  first
anniversary of the Termination Date (the "Extended Maturity Date"). In the event
Company  elects  to  exercise  its  option to extend  the  maturity  date of the
Committed  Loans,  Company shall, by written notice  received by  Administrative
Agent (a "Notice of Extension of Maturity  Date") not less than 20 nor more than
60 days prior to the Termination  Date,  advise the Banks that it shall exercise
its  option  to  extend  the  maturity   date  of  the  Committed   Loans.   The
Administrative  Agent will promptly,  and in any event within five Business Days

constitute a representation by Company that (A) no Event of Default has occurred
and is  continuing  and (B) the  representations  and  warranties  contained  in
Article IV are  correct  on and as of the date of such  Notice of  Extension  of
Maturity Date, as though made on and as of such date (unless any  representation
and warranty  expressly  relates to an earlier  date).  In the event the Company
elects to extend the maturity of the Committed  Loans,  the Alternate  Base Rate
and  Applicable  Margin (as the case may be)  applicable to the Committed  Loans
during the Term Loan Phase shall be increased by .25% per annum.

          SECTION 2.02    Loans and  Borrowings. (a)  Each  Committed Loan shall
be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Committed Loans made by the Lenders
ratably in  accordance  with their  respective  Commitments.  The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan  required  to be made by it shall not  relieve any other
Lender  of  its  obligations  hereunder;   provided  that  the  Commitments  and
Competitive  Bids of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be  responsible
for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.14 (i) each  Committed  Borrowing  (including
Committed  Loans  continued and  converted  during the Term Loan Phase) shall be
comprised  entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar  Loans as the Company may request
in accordance herewith,  and (ii) each Competitive  Borrowing shall be comprised
entirely of  Eurodollar  Loans or Fixed Rate Loans as the Company may request in
accordance  herewith.  Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by
causing any domestic or foreign  branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan;  provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of the  Company  to  repay  such  Loan in  accordance  with  the  terms  of this
Agreement.

          (c) At the  commencement  of each Interest  Period for any  Eurodollar
Committed  Borrowing,  such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000.  At the time that
each ABR Committed  Borrowing is made,  such Borrowing  shall be in an aggregate
amount that is an integral multiple


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


of  $1,000,000  and not less than  $1,000,000;  provided  that an ABR  Committed
Borrowing  may be in an  aggregate  amount  that is equal to the  entire  unused
balance of the Total  Commitment.  Each  Competitive  Bid Request shall be in an
aggregate  amount that is an integral  multiple of $1,000,000  and not less than
$25,000,000.  Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be  outstanding  at
the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of
six Eurodollar Committed Borrowings outstanding.

          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
shall not be  entitled  to  request,  or to elect to  convert or  continue,  any
Borrowing if the Interest Period  requested with respect thereto would end after
the Maturity Date.

          SECTION 2.03    Requests for  Committed   Borrowings.    To  request a
Committed  Borrowing,  the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  not later than
10:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina, time, three Business Days before the date
of the proposed  Borrowing  and (b) in the case of an ABR  Borrowing,  not later
than 10:00 a.m.,  Charlotte,  North Carolina,  time, on the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the  Administrative  Agent
of a written Borrowing Request in a form of Exhibit 2.03 (a "Borrowing Request")
and signed by the Company.  Each such telephonic and written  Borrowing  Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

          (iv) in the  case of a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the  initial  Interest
     Period to be applicable  thereto,  which shall be a period  contemplated by
     the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

          (v) the  location and number of the  Company's  account to which funds
     are to be disbursed,  which shall comply with the  requirements  of Section
     2.07.

If no election as to the Type of  Committed  Borrowing  is  specified,  then the
requested Committed  Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Committed Borrowing,  then
the Company shall be deemed to have  selected an Interest  Period of one month's
duration.  Promptly  following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this  Section  2.03,  the  Administrative  Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details  thereof and of the amount of such  Lender's  Loan to be made as part of
the requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04    Competitive Bid Procedure.  (a) Subject  to  the terms
and  conditions  set forth  herein,  from time to time  during the  Availability
Period the Company may request  Competitive Bids and may (but shall not have any
obligation to) accept Competitive Bids and borrow  Competitive  Loans;  provided
that the sum of the total Committed Credit Exposures


                                      -23-
<PAGE>


plus the aggregate  principal  amount of outstanding  Competitive  Loans, at any
time shall not exceed the Total  Commitment.  To request  Competitive  Bids, the
Company shall notify the Administrative  Agent of such request by telephone,  in
the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., Charlotte,  North
Carolina,  time,  four Business  Days before the date of the proposed  Borrowing
and,  in the  case of a  Fixed  Rate  Borrowing,  not  later  than  10:00  a.m.,
Charlotte,  North  Carolina,  time,  one  Business  Day  before  the date of the
proposed  Borrowing;  provided  that the  Company may submit up to (but not more
than) three  Competitive  Bid  Requests on the same day, but a  Competitive  Bid
Request shall not be made on any of the five Business Days next  succeeding  the
date of any previous  Competitive Bid Request,  unless any and all such previous
Competitive  Bid  Requests  shall have been  withdrawn or all  Competitive  Bids
received in response  thereto  rejected.  Each such  telephonic  Competitive Bid
Request  shall  be  confirmed  promptly  by hand  delivery  or  telecopy  to the
Administrative Agent of a written Competitive Bid Request signed by the Company.
Each such  telephonic  and written  Competitive  Bid Request  shall  specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii)  whether such  Borrowing  is to be a  Eurodollar  Borrowing or a
     Fixed Rate Borrowing;

          (iv) the Interest  Period to be  applicable to such  Borrowing,  which
     shall be a period  contemplated  by the  definition  of the term  "Interest
     Period"; and

          (v) the  location and number of the  Company's  account to which funds
     are to be disbursed,  which shall comply with the  requirements  of Section
     2.07.

Promptly  following receipt of a Competitive Bid Request in accordance with this
Section,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  notify the  Lenders of the  details
thereof by telecopy  (in  substantially  the form set forth in Exhibit  2.04-B),
inviting the Lenders to submit Competitive Bids.

          (b) Each Lender may (but shall not have any obligation to) make one or
more  Competitive  Bids to the Company in response to a Competitive Bid Request.
Each  Competitive  Bid by a Lender  must be  substantially  the form of  Exhibit
2.04-C and must be received by the Administrative Agent by telecopy, in the case
of a Eurodollar  Competitive  Borrowing,  not later than 10:00 a.m.,  Charlotte,
North  Carolina,  time,  three  Business  Days before the proposed  date of such
Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than
10:00 a.m.,  Charlotte,  North  Carolina,  time,  on the  proposed  date of such
Competitive Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the
form of Exhibit  2.04-C may be rejected  by the  Administrative  Agent,  and the
Administrative   Agent  shall  notify  the  applicable  Lender  as  promptly  as
practicable.  Each Competitive Bid shall specify (i) the principal amount (which
shall be a minimum of  $5,000,000  and an integral  multiple of  $1,000,000  and
which  may equal  the  entire  principal  amount  of the  Competitive  Borrowing
requested  by the Company) of the  Competitive  Loan or Loans that the Lender is
willing to make,  (ii) the  Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which the Lender is
prepared to make such Loan or Loans (expressed as a percentage


                                      -24-
<PAGE>


rate per annum in the form of a decimal to no more than four decimal places) and
(iii) the Interest Period  applicable to each such Loan and the last day thereof
(which shall conform to that specified in the Company's related  Competitive Bid
Request).

          (c) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify the Company by
telecopy of the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal  amount specified in each
Competitive  Bid and the  identity  of the  Lender  that  shall  have  made such
Competitive Bid.

          (d) Subject only to the provisions of this paragraph,  the Company may
accept or reject any  Competitive  Bid in whole or (to the extent  herein  below
provided)  in  part.  The  Company  shall  notify  the  Administrative  Agent by
telephone, confirmed by telecopy in a form approved by the Administrative Agent,
whether and to what  extent it has decided to accept or reject each  Competitive
Bid, in the case of a  Eurodollar  Competitive  Borrowing,  not later than 11:30
a.m.,  Charlotte,  North Carolina,  time, three Business Days before the date of
the proposed Competitive  Borrowing,  and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing,
not later than 11:30 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina, time, on the proposed date
of the  Competitive  Borrowing;  provided that (i) the failure of the Company to
give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of each Competitive Bid, (ii)
the Company shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular  Competitive
Bid Rate if the Company  rejects a Competitive  Bid made at a lower  Competitive
Bid Rate,  (iii) the aggregate  amount of the  Competitive  Bids accepted by the
Company  shall not  exceed the  aggregate  amount of the  requested  Competitive
Borrowing specified in the related  Competitive Bid Request,  (iv) to the extent
necessary to comply with clause (iii) above, the Company may accept  Competitive
Bids at the same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which acceptance,  in the case of
multiple  Competitive  Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata
in  accordance  with the  amount of each such  Competitive  Bid,  and (v) except
pursuant to clause  (iv)  above,  no  Competitive  Bid shall be  accepted  for a
Competitive Loan unless such  Competitive Loan is in a minimum  principal amount
of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided further that if a
Competitive  Loan  must be in an  amount  less than  $5,000,000  because  of the
provisions of clause (iv) above,  such  Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of
$1,000,000 or any integral  multiple  thereof,  and in calculating  the pro rata
allocation  of  acceptances  of  portions  of  multiple  Competitive  Bids  at a
particular  Competitive  Bid Rate  pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts  shall be
rounded to  integral  multiples  of  $1,000,000  in a manner  determined  by the
Company. A notice given by the Company pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) shall be
irrevocable.

          (e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender
by telecopy  whether or not its  Competitive  Bid has been accepted (and, if so,
the amount and  Competitive Bid Rate so accepted),  and each  successful  bidder
will thereupon become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make
the Competitive  Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.
After  completing the  notifications  referred to in the  immediately  preceding
sentence,  the  Administrative  Agent shall notify each Lender of the  aggregate
principal amount of all Competitive Bids accepted.

          (f) Upon determination by the  Administrative  Agent of the LIBOR Rate
applicable to any Eurodollar  Competitive Loan to be made by any Lender pursuant
to a  Competitive  Bid that has been  accepted by a Company  pursuant to Section
2.04(d), the


                                      -25-
<PAGE>


Administrative  Agent shall notify such Lender of (i) the applicable  LIBOR Rate
and (ii) the sum of the  applicable  LIBOR  Rate  plus  the  Margin  bid by such
Lender.

          (g) If the Administrative  Agent or any of its Affiliates shall at any
time have a Commitment  hereunder and shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in
its capacity as a Lender,  it shall submit such  Competitive Bid directly to the
Company at least one quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the other
Lenders are  required to submit  their  Competitive  Bids to the  Administrative
Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

          SECTION 2.05    THIS SECTION IS INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

          SECTION 2.06    Telephonic  Notices.  Without in any way limiting  the
obligation  of the  Company to confirm in writing  any  telephonic  notice it is
entitled  to  give  under  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document,  the
Administrative  Agent may act without  liability  upon the basis of a telephonic
notice believed in good faith by the Administrative Agent to be from the Company
prior to receipt of written confirmation.  In each such case, the Company hereby
waives the right to dispute the  Administrative  Agent's  record of the terms of
such telephonic notice.

          SECTION 2.07    Funding  of  Borrowings.  (a) Each  Lender  shall make
each  Loan to be made by it  hereunder  on the  proposed  date  thereof  by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina,
time, to the account of the Administrative  Agent most recently designated by it
for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Charlotte,
North  Carolina,  time) on the proposed  Borrowing  Date,  each Lender will make
available to the  Administrative  Agent, for the account of the Company,  at the
office  of the  Administrative  Agent  in  funds  immediately  available  to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender's Loans to be made on such Borrowing Date. The
Company hereby irrevocably  authorizes the Administrative  Agent to disburse the
proceeds  of  each  Borrowing   requested  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.07  in
immediately  available funds by crediting or wiring such proceeds to the deposit
account  of the  Company  identified  in  the  most  recent  Notice  of  Account
Designation  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit  2.07  hereto (a  "Notice of
Account  Designation")  delivered by the Company to the Administrative  Agent or
otherwise agreed upon by the Company and the  Administrative  Agent from time to
time.

          (b) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender  prior to the  proposed  date of any  Borrowing  (or prior to 12:00 noon,
Charlotte,  North Carolina,  time, on such date in the case of an ABR Borrowing)
that such  Lender  will not make  available  to the  Administrative  Agent  such
Lender's share of such Borrowing,  the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share  available  on such date in  accordance  with Section
2.07(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company
a  corresponding  amount.  In such  event,  if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable  Borrowing  available to the Administrative  Agent, then
the  applicable   Lender  and  the  Company   severally  agree  to  pay  to  the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Company
to the date of payment to the  Administrative  Agent, at (i) in the case of such
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Company, the
interest rate applicable to


                                      -26-
<PAGE>


ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the  Administrative  Agent,  then
such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.08    Interest  Elections. (a) Subject to Section 2.14, each
Committed  Borrowing  initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar  Committed  Borrowing,  shall
have  an  initial  Interest  Period  as  specified  in such  Borrowing  Request.
Thereafter, including throughout the Term Loan Phase, if applicable, and subject
to Section 2.14,  the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different
Type or to continue such  Borrowing  and, in the case of a Eurodollar  Committed
Borrowing,  may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section
2.08. The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions
of the affected  Borrowing,  in which case each such portion  shall be allocated
ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans  comprising such Borrowing,  and the
Loans  comprising  each such portion shall be  considered a separate  Borrowing.
This Section 2.08 shall not apply to  Competitive  Borrowings,  which may not be
converted or continued.

          (b) To make an election  pursuant to this  Section  2.08,  the Company
shall notify the Administrative  Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing  Request  would be required  under  Section 2.03 if the Company
were  requesting a Committed  Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be  made  on the  effective  date of such  election  (disregarding  for  this
purpose, during the Term Loan Phase, the fact that no such Borrowing Request was
then authorized by Section 2.03). Each such telephonic Interest Election Request
shall be  irrevocable  and  shall be  confirmed  promptly  by hand  delivery  or
telecopy to the  Administrative  Agent of a written Interest Election Request in
the form of Exhibit 2.08 (an "Interest Election Request").

          (c) Each  telephonic  and  written  Interest  Election  Request  shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
     if different  options are being elected with respect to different  portions
     thereof,  the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting  Borrowing
     (in which case the  information  to be specified  pursuant to clauses (iii)
     and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
     Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the  resulting  Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv)  if  the  resulting  Borrowing  is a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the
     Interest  Period  to be  applicable  thereto  after  giving  effect to such
     election,  which shall be a period  contemplated  by the  definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest  Election Request requests a Eurodollar  Borrowing but does
not  specify  an  Interest  Period,  then the  Company  shall be  deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.


                                      -27-
<PAGE>


          (d) Promptly  following receipt of an Interest  Election Request,  the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request

with  respect  to a  Eurodollar  Committed  Borrowing  prior  to the  end of the
Interest Period  applicable  thereto,  then,  unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided  herein,  at the end of such Interest  Period such  Borrowing  shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
and so long as an Event of Default is continuing  (i) no  outstanding  Committed
Borrowing  may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar  Borrowing  and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar  Committed Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.09    Termination  and Reduction of Commitments.  (a) Unless
previously terminated,  the Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date,
and amounts repaid thereafter may not be reborrowed.

          (b) The  Company  may at any  time  terminate,  or  from  time to time
reduce,  the  Total  Commitment,  in whole or in  part;  provided  that (i) each
partial  reduction  of the Total  Commitment  shall be in an  amount  that is an
integral  multiple  of  $1,000,000  and not less  than  $5,000,000  and (ii) the
Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to
any concurrent  prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum
of the total Committed Credit Exposures,  plus the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Competitive Loans, would exceed the Total Commitment.

          (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative  Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Total Commitment under Section 2.09(b) at least three
Business  Days prior to the  effective  date of such  termination  or reduction,
specifying  such election and the effective  date  thereof.  Promptly  following
receipt of any notice, the Administrative  Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section
2.09 shall be  irrevocable;  provided that a notice of  termination of the Total
Commitment  delivered  by the Company may state that such notice is  conditioned
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may
be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative  Agent on or prior to
the  specified  effective  date)  if  such  condition  is  not  satisfied.   Any
termination  or  reduction  of the Total  Commitment  shall be  permanent.  Each
reduction of the Total  Commitment  shall be made  ratably  among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

          (d) The Total Commitment shall  automatically  terminate on the date a
Change in Control occurs.

          SECTION 2.10    Repayment  of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Company
hereby  unconditionally  promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid  principal  amount of each Committed Loan
on the  Maturity  Date and (ii) to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of
each Lender  having a Competitive  Loan  outstanding  the then unpaid  principal
amount  of  each  Competitive  Loan  on the  last  day of  the  Interest  Period
applicable to such Loan. In addition,  if prior to the Termination  Date the sum
of


                                      -28-
<PAGE>


the total Committed Credit Exposures, plus the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding  Competitive Loans, exceeds the Total Commitment,  the Company shall
pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account of each  Lender an  aggregate
principal  amount of Committed  Loans  sufficient  to cause the sum of the total
Committed  Credit  Exposures,   plus  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the
outstanding Competitive Loans, not to exceed the Total Commitment.

          (b) On the date that a Change in Control  occurs,  the  Company  shall
repay the  outstanding  principal  amount  of the  Loans  and all other  amounts
outstanding hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

          (c) Each Lender shall  maintain in accordance  with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Company to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the Class and Type  thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto,  (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest  due and payable or to become due and payable  from the Company to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the  Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (e) The entries  made in the accounts  maintained  pursuant to Section
2.10(c) or (d) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations  recorded  therein;  provided  that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative  Agent to maintain such accounts or any error or conflict therein
shall not in any manner affect the  obligation of the Company to repay the Loans
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (f) Any Lender may  request  that Loans made by it be  evidenced  by a
Committed  Note or a Competitive  Note,  as the case may be. In such event,  the
Company shall prepare,  execute and deliver to such Lender a Committed Note or a
Competitive  Note, as the case may be.  Thereafter,  the Loans evidenced by such
promissory  note and  interest  thereon  shall  at all  times  (including  after
assignment  pursuant to Section 9.05) be represented  by one or more  promissory
notes in such forms payable to the order of the payee named therein.

          SECTION  2.11    Prepayment  of Loans.  (a) The Company shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any  Borrowing  in whole or in
part, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.11(b);  provided that
the Company shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive  Loan without the
prior consent of the Lender thereof.

          (b) The Company  shall  notify the  Administrative  Agent by telephone
(confirmed  by telecopy in the form of Exhibit 2.11 (a "Notice of  Prepayment"))
of any  prepayment  hereunder  (i) in the  case of  prepayment  of a  Eurodollar
Committed Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina, time,
three  Business  Days  before  the  date of  prepayment  or (ii) in the  case of
prepayment of an ABR Committed Borrowing,  not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte,
North Carolina, time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


be  irrevocable  and shall specify the prepayment  date,  Type and the principal
amount of each Borrowing or portion  thereof to be prepaid;  provided that, if a
notice  of  prepayment  is given in  connection  with a  conditional  notice  of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice
of  prepayment  may be  revoked  if such  notice of  termination  is  revoked in
accordance with Section 2.09. Each partial  prepayment  shall be in an aggregate
amount not less than,  and shall be an integral  multiple of, the amounts  shown
below with respect to the applicable Type of Loan or Borrowing:

        ------------------------------------------------------------
                   Type of                  Integral      Minimum
                Loan/Borrowing              Multiple     Aggregate
                                               of         Amount
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Eurodollar Committed Borrowing   $ 1,000,00    $ 3,000,000
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        ABR Committed Borrowing            1,000,000     1,000,000
        ------------------------------------------------------------

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Committed Borrowing,
the  Administrative  Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  If
the Company fails to designate  the Type of  Borrowings  to be prepaid,  partial
prepayments  shall be applied first to the outstanding ABR Borrowings  until all
such outstanding principal of ABR Borrowings are repaid in full, and then to the
outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar  Borrowings.  Each partial prepayment
of any Committed  Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the
case of an advance of a  Committed  Borrowing  of the same Type as  provided  in
Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Committed  Borrowing shall be applied ratably
to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

          SECTION 2.12    Fees.   (a)  The   Company   agrees  to  pay   to  the
Administrative  Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall
accrue at the applicable Facility Fee Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment
of such Lender,  whether used or unused and, when the Commitment has terminated,
on the outstanding Loans of such Lender, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the later of (i) the date on which such  Commitment  terminates and
(ii) the date on which the Loans are paid in full.  Accrued  facility fees shall
be payable in arrears on the last  Business Day of March,  June,  September  and
December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate and the
date the Loans  are paid in full,  commencing  on the  first  such date to occur
after the date  hereof.  All  facility  fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (b) The Company agrees to pay to each of the Administrative  Agent and
Wachovia Securities,  Inc., for their own accounts,  fees payable in the amounts
and at the times  specified in that letter  agreement  dated  September 12, 2002
among the Company, the Administrative  Agent and Wachovia  Securities,  Inc. (as
from time to time amended, the "Fee Letter").

          (c) The  Company  agrees  to pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the
account of each Lender a utilization fee (the  "Utilization  Fee"),  which shall
accrue at a rate per annum equal to .125% on:


                                      -30-
<PAGE>


          (i) each  Lender's  Commitment  (whether  used or unused) for each day
     during the period from the Effective Date to the Termination Date, on which
     the  sum of the  total  Committed  Credit  Exposures,  plus  the  aggregate
     principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans, plus the aggregate loans
     and  letters of credit  outstanding  under the  Related  Credit  Agreement,
     exceeds 50% of the sum of the Total Commitment plus the "Total  Commitment"
     (as defined in the Related Credit Agreement), and

          (ii) each Lender's  Committed  Credit Exposure for each day during the
     period from the Termination  Date to the date on which the Committed Credit
     Exposures of all Lenders,  all Competitive  Loans and all loans outstanding
     under the Related Credit  Agreement are paid in full or reduced to zero, on
     which the sum of the total Committed Credit  Exposures,  plus the aggregate
     principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans, plus the aggregate loans
     and  letters of credit  outstanding  under the  Related  Credit  Agreement,
     exceeds 50% of the sum of Total Commitment, plus the "Total Commitment" (as
     defined  in  the  Related  Credit  Agreement)  determined  as  of  the  day
     immediately preceding the Termination Date.

All Utilization Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September  and  December  of each  year  and on the date  the  Committed  Credit
Exposures  of all Lenders and all  Competitive  Loans and all loans  outstanding
under the Related  Credit  Agreement are paid in full or reduced to zero, as the
case may be,  commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the Effective
Date.  All  Utilization  Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (d) All fees  payable  hereunder  shall be paid on the dates  due,  in
immediately  available funds, to the Administrative Agent (for distribution,  in
the case of Facility  Fees and  Utilization  Fees,  to the  Lenders).  Except as
required by law, fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.13    Interest.  (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
(i) in the  case of a  Eurodollar  Committed  Loan,  at the  LIBOR  Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable  Margin or (ii)
in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, at the LIBOR Rate for the Interest
Period in effect for such  Borrowing plus (or minus,  as applicable)  the Margin
applicable to such Loan.

          (c) Each  Fixed  Rate Loan  shall  bear  interest  at the  Fixed  Rate
applicable to such Loan.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Company hereunder is not paid
when due,  whether at stated  maturity,  upon  acceleration  or otherwise,  such
overdue amount shall bear interest,  after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any


                                      -31-
<PAGE>


Loan, 2% plus the rate  otherwise  applicable to such Loan as provided  above or
(ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the Alternate Base Rate.

          (e) Accrued  interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to  Section  2.13(d)  shall  be  payable  on  demand,  (ii) in the  event of any
repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Committed
Loan  prior to the end of the  Availability  Period),  accrued  interest  on the
principal  amount  repaid  or  prepaid  shall  be  payable  on the  date of such
repayment or prepayment,  (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar
Committed Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued
interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such  conversion
and (iv) all accrued  interest  shall be payable upon  termination  of the Total
Commitment.

          (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days,  except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times  when the  Alternate  Base  Rate is based on the  Prime  Rate  shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed  (including the
first day but excluding the last day).  The  applicable  Alternate  Base Rate or
LIBOR  Rate  shall  be  determined  by  the   Administrative   Agent,  and  such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14    Alternate   Rate   of  Interest.   If  prior   to  the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative  Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive  absent  manifest  error) that adequate and  reasonable  means do not
exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period; or

          (b) the  Administrative  Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
in the case of a Eurodollar  Competitive Loan, by the Lender that is required to
make such Loan) that the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining
their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the  Administrative  Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the
Lenders by  telephone  or telecopy as promptly as  practicable  thereafter  and,
until the  Administrative  Agent  notifies  the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances  giving  rise to such  notice no longer  exist,  (i) any  Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Committed  Borrowing to, or
continuation  of any  Committed  Borrowing as, a Eurodollar  Borrowing  shall be
ineffective,  (ii) if any  Borrowing  Request  requests a  Eurodollar  Committed
Borrowing,  such  Borrowing  shall be made as an ABR  Borrowing  and  (iii)  any
request  by  the  Company  for  a  Eurodollar  Competitive  Borrowing  shall  be
ineffective;  provided that (A) if the circumstances  giving rise to such notice
do not affect all the  Lenders,  then  requests by the  Company  for  Eurodollar
Competitive  Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and
(B) if the  circumstances  giving  rise to such  notice  affect only one Type of
Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.


                                      -32-

          SECTION 2.15    Increased Costs.  (a) If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit  extended  by, any Lender  (except any such  reserve  requirement
     reflected in the LIBOR Rate); or

          (ii)  impose on any  Lender or the London  interbank  market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining  any  Eurodollar  Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any
sum  received or  receivable  by such Lender  hereunder  (whether of  principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will  compensate  such  Lender  for such  additional  costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) If any Lender  determines that any Change in Law regarding capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company,  if any, as
a  consequence  of this  Agreement  or the Loans made by such  Lender to a level
below  that  which  such  Lender or such  Lender's  holding  company  could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking  into  consideration  such  Lender's
policies  and the  policies of such  Lender's  holding  company  with respect to
capital  adequacy),  then from time to time the Company  will pay to such Lender
such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as will  compensate  such  Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c) A  certificate  of a Lender  setting  forth the  amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company,  as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph  (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to
the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such  certificate  within 10 Business
Days after receipt thereof.

          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand  compensation
pursuant to this  Section 2.15 shall not  constitute  a waiver of such  Lender's
right to  demand  such  compensation;  provided  that the  Company  shall not be
required to compensate a Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased
costs or  reductions  incurred  more than six months prior to the date that such
Lender  notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such  increased
costs  or  reductions  and of such  Lender's  intention  to  claim  compensation
therefor;  provided  further  that,  if the  Change in Law  giving  rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.16    Break  Funding  Payments.  In  the  event  of (a)  the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable  thereto (including as a result of
an Event of Default),  (b) the conversion of any  Eurodollar  Loan other than on
the last day of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  (c) the  failure to
borrow (unless such failure was caused by the failure of a Lender to


                                      -33-
<PAGE>


make such Loan), convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan, or the failure
to convert an ABR Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, on the date specified in any notice
delivered  pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be
revocable  under  Section 2.09 and is revoked in accordance  herewith),  (d) the
failure to borrow any  Competitive  Loan after  accepting the Competitive Bid to
make such Loan  (unless  such  failure  was caused by the failure of a Lender to
make such Loan), or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Company  pursuant to Section 2.19,  then, in any such event,
the  Company  shall  compensate  each  Lender  for the  loss,  cost and  expense
attributable  to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar  Loan, the loss to any
Lender  attributable  to any such  event  shall be deemed to  include  an amount
determined  by such Lender to be equal to the excess,  if any, of (i) the amount
of interest  that such  Lender  would pay for a deposit  equal to the  principal
amount of such Loan for the period  from the date of such  payment,  conversion,
failure or  assignment to the last day of the then current  Interest  Period for
such Loan (or,  in the case of a failure to borrow,  convert  or  continue,  the
duration of the Interest  Period that would have resulted  from such  borrowing,
conversion  or  continuation)  if the interest rate payable on such deposit were
equal to the  LIBOR  Rate for such  Interest  Period,  over  (ii) the  amount of
interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if
such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest
rate that  would be bid by such  Lender (or an  affiliate  of such  Lender)  for
dollar deposits from other banks in the Eurodollar market at the commencement of
such period.  A  certificate  of any Lender  setting forth any amount or amounts
that such Lender is entitled to receive  pursuant to this  Section 2.16 shall be
delivered to the Company and shall be  conclusive  absent  manifest  error.  The
Company  shall pay such Lender the amount  shown as due on any such  certificate
within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.17    Taxes.  (a) Any  and all  payments by or on account of
any  obligation  of the  Company  hereunder  shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Company  shall be required to deduct any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments,  then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the  Administrative  Agent or a
Lender (as the case may be)  receives  an amount  equal to the sum it would have
received  had no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) the Company  shall make such
deductions  and (iii) the  Company  shall pay the full  amount  deducted  to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) The Company  shall  indemnify  the  Administrative  Agent and each
Lender,  within 10 Business Days after  written  demand  therefor,  for the full
amount of any Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes (including  Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 2.17(c)) paid by the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender,  as the case
may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A  certificate  as to the amount of such payment or  liability  delivered to the
Company by a Lender, or by the


                                      -34-
<PAGE>


Administrative  Agent on its own  behalf  or on  behalf  of a  Lender,  shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) As soon as practicable  after any payment of Indemnified  Taxes or
Other  Taxes by the  Company to a  Governmental  Authority,  the  Company  shall
deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent the  original  or a  certified  copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return  reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment  reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Any  Foreign  Lender  that is  entitled  to an  exemption  from or
reduction  of  withholding  tax under the law of the  jurisdiction  in which the
Company is located,  or any treaty to which such  jurisdiction is a party,  with
respect to payments  under this  Agreement  shall deliver to the Company (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Company, such properly completed and executed
documentation  prescribed by  applicable  law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

          (f) If the Administrative  Agent or a Lender  determines,  in its sole
discretion,  that it has  received  a refund of any  Taxes or Other  Taxes as to
which it has been  indemnified  by the  Company  or with  respect  to which  the
Company has paid additional  amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
over such refund to the Company  (but only to the extent of  indemnity  payments
made,  or  additional  amounts paid, by the Company under this Section 2.17 with
respect to the Taxes and Other  Taxes  giving rise to such  refund),  net of all
out-of-pocket  expenses of the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender and without
interest  (other than any interest paid by the relevant  Governmental  Authority
with respect to such refund);  provided,  that the Company,  upon the request of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the  Company  (plus any  penalties,  interest  or other  charges  imposed by the
relevant  Governmental  Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender is  required  to repay such
refund  to such  Governmental  Authority.  This  Section  2.17(f)  shall  not be
construed to require the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender to make  available
its tax returns (or any other  information  relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Company or any other Person.

          SECTION 2.18    Payments  Generally;  Pro  Rata Treatment;  Sharing of
Set-offs.  (a) The Company  shall make each  payment  required to be made by the
Company  hereunder  (whether of  principal,  interest or fees,  or under Section
2.15,  2.16 or  2.17,  or  otherwise)  prior  to 12:00  noon,  Charlotte,  North
Carolina,  time, on the date when due, in immediately  available funds,  without
set-off or  counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may,
in the discretion of the  Administrative  Agent, be deemed to have been received
on the  next  succeeding  Business  Day for  purposes  of  calculating  interest
thereon.  All such  payments  shall be made to the  Administrative  Agent at its
Principal Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and
9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative
Agent shall  distribute any such payments  received by it for the account of any
other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If
any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date
for payment shall be extended to the next  succeeding  Business Day, and, in the
case of any payment accruing


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


interest,  interest  thereon shall be payable for the period of such  extension.
All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the  Administrative  Agent to pay fully all amounts of  principal,  interest and
fees then due hereunder,  such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest
and fees then due  hereunder,  ratably  among the  parties  entitled  thereto in
accordance  with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,  and
(ii) second,  to pay  principal  then due  hereunder,  ratably among the parties
entitled  thereto in accordance  with the amounts of principal  then due to such
parties.

          (c) If any  Lender  shall,  by  exercising  any  right of  set-off  or
counterclaim  or  otherwise,  obtain  payment in respect of any  principal of or
interest  on any of its  Committed  Loans  resulting  in such  Lender  receiving
payment of a greater  proportion of the aggregate  amount of its Committed Loans
and accrued interest  thereon than the proportion  received by any other Lender,
then the Lender  receiving such greater  proportion  shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in the Committed Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary  so that the  benefit  of all such  payments  shall be  shared  by the
Lenders  ratably in  accordance  with the  aggregate  amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective  Committed Loans;  provided that (i) if any
such  participations  are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise  thereto is  recovered,  such  participations  shall be  rescinded  and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,  without  interest,  and
(ii) the  provisions  of this  paragraph  shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms
of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as  consideration  for the
assignment  of or sale of a  participation  in any of its Loans to any assignee,
other than to the Company or any  Subsidiary  or Affiliate  thereof (as to which
the  provisions  of this  paragraph  shall apply).  The Company  consents to the
foregoing and agrees,  to the extent it may  effectively do so under  applicable
law,  that any  Lender  acquiring  a  participation  pursuant  to the  foregoing
arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of set-off and counterclaim
with  respect to such  participation  as fully as if such  Lender  were a direct
creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have received  notice from
the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the  Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders  hereunder  that the Company  will not make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such
payment on such date in  accordance  herewith  and may,  in  reliance  upon such
assumption,  distribute  to the Lenders  the amount  due. In such event,  if the
Company has not in fact made such  payment,  then each of the Lenders  severally
agrees to repay to the  Administrative  Agent  forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed  to such Lender with  interest  thereon,  for each day from the date
such amount is  distributed  to it to the date of payment to the  Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

          (e) If any Lender  shall fail to make any payment  required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may,
in its discretion  (notwithstanding  any contrary provision  hereof),  apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative  Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's  obligations  under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.19    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender  requests  compensation  under  Section  2.15,  or if the  Company is
required  to pay  any  additional  amount  to  any  Lender  or any  Governmental
Authority  for the  account of any Lender  pursuant to Section  2.17,  then such
Lender shall use reasonable  efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans  hereunder or to assign its rights and  obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender,  such  designation or assignment  (i) would  eliminate or reduce
amounts  payable  pursuant to Section  2.15 or 2.17,  as the case may be, in the
future  and (ii)  would not  subject  such  Lender to any  unreimbursed  cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (b) If any Lender requests  compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Company  is  required  to  pay  any  additional  amount  to  any  Lender  or any
Governmental  Authority for the account of any Lender  pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender  defaults in its obligation to fund Loans  hereunder,  then the
Company may, at its sole expense and effort,  upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative  Agent,  require  such  Lender to assign  and  delegate,  without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section 9.05), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such  obligations  (which  assignee may be another
Lender,  if a Lender  accepts such  assignment);  provided  that (i) the Company
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the  outstanding  principal of its Loans,  accrued
interest  thereon,  accrued fees and all other amounts  payable to it hereunder,
from the  assignee  (to the extent of such  outstanding  principal  and  accrued
interest  and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other  amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section  2.15 or payments  required to be made  pursuant to Section  2.17,  such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required  to make any such  assignment  and  delegation  if,  prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,  the circumstances
entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

          SECTION 2.20    Extensions  of Termination Date;  Removal of Lenders.
(a) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (a "Notice of
Extension")  given  not  less  than 30 nor more  than 45 days  prior to the then
effective  Termination Date, advise the Lenders that it requests an extension of
the then effective  Termination Date (such then effective Termination Date being
the "Existing Termination Date") by 364 calendar days, effective on the Existing
Termination  Date.  The  Administrative  Agent will  promptly,  and in any event
within five Business Days of the receipt of such Notice of Extension, notify the
Lenders of the contents of each such Notice of Extension.

          (b)  Each  Notice  of  Extension  shall  (i) be  irrevocable  and (ii)
constitute a representation by the Company that (A) neither any Event of Default
nor any Default has occurred and is continuing,  and (B) the representations and
warranties contained in Article IV are correct on and as of such date, as though
made on and as of such date (unless any  representation  and warranty  expressly
relates to an  earlier  date).  In the event the  Existing  Termination  Date is
extended pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.20, the Company shall be deemed
to represent on and as of the effective  date of such extension that (i) neither
any Event of Default nor any Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  and (ii)
the representations and


                                      -37-
<PAGE>


warranties contained in Article IV are correct on and as of such date, as though
made on and as of such date (unless any  representation  and warranty  expressly
relates to an earlier date).

          (c) In the event a Notice of Extension is given to the  Administrative
Agent as provided in Section  2.20(a) and the  Administrative  Agent  notifies a
Lender of the contents thereof, such Lender shall on or before the 20th day next
preceding  the  Existing  Termination  Date advise the  Administrative  Agent in
writing whether or not such Lender consents to the extension  requested  thereby
and if any Lender fails so to advise the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall
be deemed to have not  consented to such  extension.  If Lenders  holding 80% or
more of the Total  Commitment  so consent  (the  "Consenting  Lenders")  to such
extension  and any and all Lenders who have not consented  (the  "Non-Consenting
Lenders")  are  replaced,  the  Termination  Date,  and the  Commitments  of the
Consenting  Lenders and the Nominees (as defined  below) shall be  automatically
extended 364 calendar days past the Existing  Termination Date, effective on the
Existing  Termination Date. The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the
Company and all of the Lenders of each written  notice of consent given pursuant
to this Section 2.20(c).

          (d) In the event  the  Consenting  Lenders  hold less than 100% of the
Total Commitment,  the Consenting  Lenders, or any of them, shall have the right
(but not the  obligation)  to assume all or any  portion  of the  Non-Consenting
Lenders'   Commitments   by  giving  written  notice  to  the  Company  and  the
Administrative  Agent of their  election to do so on or before the 15th day next
preceding the Existing  Termination  Date, which notice shall be irrevocable and
shall  constitute an undertaking  to (i) assume,  as of the close of business on
the Existing  Termination  Date,  all or such portion of the  Commitments of the
Non-Consenting  Lenders, as the case may be, as may be specified in such written
notice, and (ii) purchase (without recourse) from the Non-Consenting Lenders, at
the close of business on the Existing  Termination  Date,  the Committed  Credit
Exposures  outstanding on the Existing  Termination  Date that correspond to the
portion of the  Commitments  to be so assumed at a price equal to the sum of (x)
the unpaid  principal  amount of all Loans so purchased,  plus (y) the aggregate
amount,  if any,  previously  funded by the transferor or any  participations so
purchased,  plus (z) all accrued and unpaid interest  thereon.  Such Commitments
and Committed Credit Exposures,  or portion thereof, to be assumed and purchased
by Consenting Lenders shall be allocated among those Consenting Lenders who have
so  elected  to  assume  the  same pro rata in  accordance  with the  respective
Commitments  of such  Consenting  Lenders as of the  Existing  Termination  Date
(provided,  however, in no event shall a Consenting Lender be required to assume
and  purchase  an amount or  portion of the  Commitments  and  Committed  Credit
Exposures  of the  Non-Consenting  Lenders  in excess of the  amount  which such
Consenting  Lender  agreed to assume and  purchase  pursuant to the  immediately
preceding  sentence)  or on such other  basis as such  Consenting  Lender  shall
agree. The Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the other
Consenting  Lenders in the event it receives any notice from a Consenting Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.20(d).

          (e) In the  event  that the  Consenting  Lenders  shall  not  elect as
provided in Section  2.20(d) to assume and  purchase  all of the  Non-Consenting
Lenders' Commitments and Committed Credit Exposures,  the Company may designate,
by written notice to the  Administrative  Agent and the Consenting Lenders given
on or before the tenth day next preceding the Existing  Termination Date, one or
more Eligible Assignees not a party to this


                                      -38-

Agreement (individually, a "Nominee" and collectively, the "Nominees") to assume
all or any portion of the Non-Consenting  Lenders' Commitments not to be assumed
by  the  Consenting   Lenders  and  to  purchase  (without  recourse)  from  the
Non-Consenting  Lenders all Committed Credit Exposures  outstanding at the close
of business on the Existing  Termination Date that corresponds to the portion of
the Commitments so to be assumed at the price specified in Section 2.20(d). Each
assumption and purchase under this Section  2.20(e) shall be effective as of the
close of business on the Existing  Termination  Date when each of the  following
conditions has been  satisfied in a manner  satisfactory  to the  Administrative
Agent:

          (i) each  Nominee  and the  Non-Consenting  Lenders  have  executed an
     Assignment and  Acceptance  pursuant to which such Nominee shall (A) assume
     in  writing  its share of the  obligations  of the  Non-Consenting  Lenders
     hereunder,  including its share of the  Commitments  of the  Non-Consenting
     Lenders  and (B)  agree  to be  bound  as a  Lender  by the  terms  of this
     Agreement; and

          (ii)  each  Nominee   shall  have   completed  and  delivered  to  the
     Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

          (f) If all of the  Commitments of the  Non-Consenting  Lenders are not
replaced on or before the Existing  Termination  Date,  then, at the  Borrower's
option,  either  (i)  the  Total  Commitment  shall  terminate  on the  Existing
Termination Date or (ii) the Borrower shall give prompt notice of termination on
the Existing  Termination Date of the Commitments of each Non-Consenting  Lender
not so replaced to the  Administrative  Agent,  and shall prepay on the Existing
Termination Date the Loans, if any, of such Non-Consenting  Lenders, which shall
reduce the Total  Commitment  accordingly  (to the extent not assumed),  and the
Existing Termination Date shall be extended in accordance with this Section 2.20
for the remaining Commitments of the Consenting Lenders; provided, however, that
(A) Consenting  Lenders and Nominees shall have Committed  Credit  Exposures and
unused Commitments  representing more than 80% of the sum of the total Committed
Credit   Exposures  and  unused   Commitments   prior  to   replacement  of  the
Non-Consenting  Lenders and (B) no Lender after giving  effect to the  extension
contemplated hereunder shall have more than 20% of the Total Commitment.

                                  ARTICLE III.

          SECTION   3.02    Conditions   Precedent   to  All   Borrowings.   The
obligations of the Lenders to make any Loans  hereunder  (including any Loans to
be made on the  initial  Borrowing  Date) is subject to the  further  conditions
precedent that on the date of such Borrowing:

          (a) The  conditions  precedent  set forth in  Section  3.01 shall have
theretofore been satisfied;

          (b) The  representations and warranties set forth in Article IV (other
than the  representation  set forth in  Section  4.07(c))  and in the other Loan
Documents  shall be true and correct in all  material  respects as of, and as if
such  representations  and  warranties  were made on, the Borrowing  Date of the
proposed Loan (unless such  representation  and warranty expressly relates to an
earlier date), and by the Company's  delivery of a Borrowing Request the Company
shall be deemed to have  certified to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
that such  representations  and  warranties are true and correct in all material
respects;

          (c) The Company  shall have  complied  with the  provisions of Section

          (d) No  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing or would result from such Borrowing.

The   acceptance  of  the  benefits  of  each  Borrowing   shall   constitute  a
representation  and  warranty by the Company to each of the Lenders  that all of
the conditions specified in this Section 3.02 above exist as of that time.

          SECTION 3.03    Conditions Precedent to Conversions. The obligation of
the  Lenders  to  convert  or  continue  any  existing  Borrowing  into  or as a
Eurodollar  Borrowing is subject to the condition  precedent that on the date of
such  conversion  or  continuation  no Default  or Event of  Default  shall have
occurred and be continuing  or would result from the making of such  conversion.
The  acceptance of the benefits of each such  conversion or  continuation  shall
constitute a  representation  and warranty by the Company to each of the Lenders
that no Default or Event of Default  shall have  occurred and be  continuing  or
would result from the making of such conversion or continuation.

          SECTION  3.04    Delivery  of  Documents.  All of the Loan  Documents,
certificates,  legal opinions and other documents and papers referred to in this
Article   III,   unless   otherwise   specified,   shall  be  delivered  to  the

Notes, in sufficient counterparts or copies for each of the Lenders and shall be
satisfactory in form and substance to the Lenders.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Company  makes the  following  representations  and  warranties  to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders:


                                      -41-
<PAGE>


          SECTION  4.01    Organization and Qualification.  The Company and each
of the  Subsidiaries  (a) is a  corporation,  partnership  or limited  liability
company duly  organized or formed,  validly  existing and in good standing under
the laws of the state of its incorporation,  organization or formation,  (b) has
all requisite corporate,  partnership,  limited liability company or other power
and all material governmental licenses,  authorizations,  consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted and (c) is duly  qualified to
do business and is in good standing in every  jurisdiction  in which the failure
to be so qualified would,  individually or together with all such other failures
of the Company and the  Subsidiaries,  have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date of this  Agreement,  the Persons and other  entities shown on Schedule 4.01
are  all  of the  Subsidiaries  of the  Company,  and  such  Schedule  4.01  (x)
accurately  reflects  the  direct  owner  of the  Capital  Stock  of  each  such
Subsidiary  owned  by  such  direct  owner,   (y)  accurately   identifies  such
Subsidiaries and (z) accurately sets forth the jurisdictions of their respective
incorporation, organization or formation, as the case may be.

          SECTION 4.02    Authorization,  Validity,  Etc.  The  Company  has all
requisite  partnership and other power and authority to execute and deliver, and
to incur and perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement and under the other
Loan Documents to which it is a party and to make the Borrowings hereunder,  and
all such actions have been duly  authorized by all necessary  proceedings on its
behalf.  This  Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company and  constitute  valid and
legally  binding  agreements of the Company  enforceable  against the Company in
accordance  with the respective  terms thereof,  except (a) as may be limited by
bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,   moratorium,  fraudulent  transfer,
fraudulent  conveyance  or other  similar  laws  relating  to or  affecting  the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally,  and by general principles of equity
(including  principles  of good  faith,  reasonableness,  materiality  and  fair
dealing)  which may,  among other  things,  limit the right to obtain  equitable
remedies  (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and (b) as to the enforceability of provisions for indemnification for violation
of applicable securities laws, limitations thereon arising as a matter of law or
public policy.

          SECTION 4.03    Governmental Consents, Etc. No authorization, consent,
approval,  license or exemption of or  registration,  declaration or filing with
any  Governmental  Authority,  is necessary for the valid execution and delivery
of, or the incurrence and performance by the Company of its  obligations  under,
any Loan  Document to which it is a party,  except those that have been obtained
and such matters  relating to  performance  as would  ordinarily  be done in the
ordinary course of business after the Execution Date.

          SECTION  4.04    No Breach or Violation of Agreements or Restrictions,
Etc.  Neither the execution and delivery of, nor the incurrence and  performance
by the Company of its  obligations  under,  the Loan  Documents to which it is a
party, nor the extensions of credit contemplated by the Loan Documents, will (a)
breach or violate any applicable Requirement of Law, (b) result in any breach or
violation  of any of the  terms,  covenants,  conditions  or  provisions  of, or
constitute a default  under,  or result in the creation or imposition of (or the
obligation  to create or  impose)  any Lien upon any of its  property  or assets
(other than Liens created or  contemplated  by this  Agreement)  pursuant to the
terms of, any indenture,  mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other instrument
to  which  it or  any  of the  Subsidiaries  is  party  or by  which  any of its
properties or assets,  or those of any of the  Subsidiaries is bound or to which
it is


                                      -42-
<PAGE>


subject, except for breaches,  violations and defaults under clauses (a) and (b)
that neither  individually  nor in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (c) violate any provision of the organic
documents of the Company.

          SECTION 4.05    Properties.  Each  of the Company and the Subsidiaries
has good title to, or valid  leasehold or other  interests  in, all its real and
personal  property  material to its business,  except for Liens  permitted under
Section 6.01.

          SECTION 4.06    Litigation  and  Environmental  Matters. (a) Except as
disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K delivered by the Company
to the  Lenders,  there  is no  action,  suit or  proceeding  by or  before  any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the
Company,  threatened against or affecting the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
(i) as to which there is a reasonable  possibility  of an adverse  determination
and that, if adversely  determined,  could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material   Adverse   Effect  or  (ii)  that  involves  this   Agreement  or  the
Transactions.

          (b) In the ordinary  course of its business,  the Company  conducts an
ongoing review of the effect of Environmental  Laws on the business,  operations
and  properties of the Company and the  Subsidiaries,  in the course of which it
identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including any capital
or  operating  expenditures  required  for  clean-up  or closure  of  properties
currently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to
achieve or maintain compliance with environmental  protection  standards imposed
by law or as a  condition  of any  license,  permit  or  contract,  any  related
constraints  on  operating  activities,  including  any  periodic  or  permanent
shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of
operations  conducted  thereat,  any costs or  liabilities  in  connection  with
off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Materials,  and any actual or potential
liabilities to third  parties,  including  employees,  and any related costs and
expenses).  On the basis of this review,  the Company has  reasonably  concluded
that such associated  liabilities  and costs,  including the costs of compliance
with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.07    Financial  Statements.  (a) The  consolidated  balance
sheet of the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  as at  December  31,  2001 and the
related  consolidated  statements  of income,  comprehensive  income,  partners'
capital and cash flows of the Company and the  Subsidiaries  for the fiscal year
ended on said date, with the opinion thereon of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP and
set forth in the  Company's  2001 Annual  Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the
SEC,  fairly  present,  in  conformity  with GAAP,  the  consolidated  financial
position  of the  Company  and  the  Subsidiaries  as of  such  date  and  their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such fiscal year.

          (b) The unaudited  consolidated  balance sheets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries  as at June 30, 2002 and the  related  consolidated  statements  of
income and cash flows of the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  for the  six-month
period  ended on such date and set forth in the  Company's  Quarterly  Report on
Form 10-Q for its fiscal  quarter  then  ended,  as filed  with the SEC,  fairly
present,  in  conformity  with  GAAP  applied  on a basis  consistent  with  the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.07(a), the consolidated  financial
position  of the  Company  and  the  Subsidiaries  as at  said  date  and  their
consolidated results of their operations


                                      -43-
<PAGE>


cash flows for the  six-month  period ended on said date (subject to the absence
of footnotes and to normal year-end and audit adjustments).

          (c) Since December 31, 2001, there has been no material adverse change
in the business,  assets,  liabilities or financial condition of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          SECTION 4.08    Disclosure.  All  information  heretofore furnished by
the  Company to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender for  purposes  of or in
connection  with this Agreement or any transaction  contemplated  hereby is, and
all such information  hereafter  furnished by the Company to the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender will be, true and accurate in all  material  respects on the
date as of which such  information is stated or certified.  None of the reports,
financial  statements,  certificates  or other  information  furnished  by or on
behalf of the Company to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender in  connection
with the syndication or negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified  or  supplemented  by other  information  so  furnished)  contains  any
material  misstatement  of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

          SECTION 4.09    Investment Company Act. Neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries  is, or is regulated as, an "investment  company," as such term
is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

          SECTION 4.10    Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act.   Neither  the
Company  nor any of the  Subsidiaries  is a  non-exempt  "holding  company",  or
subject to  regulation as such, or an  "affiliate"  of a "holding  company" or a
"subsidiary  company" of a "holding  company",  within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          SECTION 4.11    ERISA.  Each  member of the ERISA Group has  fulfilled
its obligations  under the minimum funding  standards of ERISA and the Code with
respect to each Plan and is in  compliance  in all  material  respects  with the
presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan.
No member of the ERISA  Group  has (i)  sought a waiver of the  minimum  funding
standard  under  Section 412 of the Code in respect of any Plan,  (ii) failed to
make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect
of any  Benefit  Arrangement,  or made  any  amendment  to any  Plan or  Benefit
Arrangement,  which has resulted or could result in the  imposition of a Lien or
the  posting  of a bond or  other  security  under  ERISA  or the  Code or (iii)
incurred  any  liability  under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability  to the
PBGC for  premiums  under  Section  4007 of  ERISA,  which  waiver,  failure  or
liability could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.12    Tax  Returns  and  Payments.   The  Company  and   the
Subsidiaries  have caused to be filed all  federal  income tax returns and other
material  tax  returns,  statements  and reports (or  obtained  extensions  with
respect  thereto)  which are  required to be filed and have paid or deposited or
made  adequate  provision in  accordance  with GAAP for the payment of all taxes
(including estimated taxes shown on such returns,  statements and reports) which
are shown to be due pursuant to such returns,  except for taxes being  contested
in good


                                      -44-
<PAGE>


faith by appropriate  proceedings for which adequate reserves in accordance with
GAAP have been  created on the books of the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  and
where the failure to pay such taxes  (individually  or in the  aggregate for the
Company and the Subsidiaries) would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.13    Compliance  with  Laws  and  Agreements.  Each  of the
Company and the  Subsidiaries  is in compliance  with all laws,  regulations and
orders of any  Governmental  Authority  applicable to it or its property and all
indentures,  agreements and other  instruments  binding upon it or its property,
except  where the failure to do so,  individually  or in the  aggregate  for the
Company and the  Subsidiaries,  could not  reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.14    Purpose  of  Loans. (a) All proceeds of the Loans will
be used for the purposes set forth in Section 5.07.

          (b) None of the  proceeds  of the  loans  under  the  Existing  Credit
Agreement or the Related Credit Agreement (as defined therein) were, and none of
the proceeds of the Loans under this Agreement or the Related  Credit  Agreement
will be, used directly or  indirectly  for the purpose of buying or carrying any
"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U (herein called "margin stock")
or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any indebtedness which was originally
incurred to buy or carry any margin stock,  or for any other purpose which might
constitute this  transaction a "purpose" credit within the meaning of Regulation
T, U or X.  Neither the Company nor any agent  acting on its behalf has taken or
will take any action which might cause this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or  the  Related  Credit  Agreement  to  violate  Regulation  T,  Regulation  U,
Regulation  X, or any other  regulation  of the Board or to violate the Exchange
Act.  Margin  stock  does not  constitute  more  than 25% of the  assets  of the
Company, or of the Company and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, and the
Company does not intend or foresee that it will ever do so.

                                   ARTICLE V.

Company will furnish to the  Administrative  Agent, in each case with sufficient

          (a) within  three days after the date in each fiscal year on which the
Company is required to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC (i) such

capital and cash flows as of the end of and for such year, setting forth in each
case in  comparative  form  the  figures  as of the end of and for the  previous
fiscal year, all reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or other independent

<PAGE>


public accountants of recognized national standing (without a "going concern" or
like qualification or exception and without any qualification or exception as to
the  scope of their  audit)  to the  effect  that  such  consolidated  financial
statements  present  fairly in all  material  respects the  financial  position,
results of operations  and cash flows of the Company and the  Subsidiaries  on a
consolidated  basis in accordance  with GAAP;  provided,  however,  that (x) the
Company  shall be deemed to have  furnished  said Annual Report on Form 10-K for
purposes  of clause  (i) if it shall  have  timely  made the same  available  on
"EDGAR"  and/or  on its  home  page on the  worldwide  web (at the  date of this
Agreement  located at  http://www.kindermorgan.com)  and complied  with the last
grammatical  paragraph of this Section 5.01 in respect thereof,  and (y) if said

cash  flows,  and the report  thereon  of such  independent  public  accountants
(without qualification or exception, and to the effect, as specified above), the
Company shall not be required to comply with clause (ii);

          (b) within three days after each date in each fiscal year on which the
Company is  required  to file a  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC (i)

Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  without  charge  (and the Company  hereby
agrees to provide such  notice);  provided that such notice may be included in a
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(c).

          SECTION 5.02    Existence,  Conduct of Business. The Company will, and
will  cause  each of the  Material  Subsidiaries  to, do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve,  renew and keep in full force and effect its legal

to the conduct of its business;  provided that the foregoing  shall not prohibit
any merger,  consolidation,  liquidation or dissolution  permitted under Section
6.02.

          SECTION  5.03    Payment  of  Obligations.  The Company will, and will
cause each of the Subsidiaries to, pay, before the same shall become  delinquent
or in default,  its obligations,  including tax liabilities,  that, if not paid,

amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,  (b)
the Company or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with
respect  thereto in  accordance  with GAAP,  and (c) the failure to make payment

and the properties and businesses of the Subsidiaries  against loss or damage of
the kinds  customarily  insured  against by business  enterprises of established
reputation  engaged in the same or similar business and similarly  situated,  of
such  types  and in  such  amounts  as are  customarily  carried  under  similar
circumstances   by  such  other   corporations.   Such   insurance  may  include
self-insurance  or be subject to co-insurance,  deductibility or similar clauses
which, in effect, result in self-insurance of certain losses, provided that such
self-insurance is in accord with the approved practices of business  enterprises
of established reputation similarly situated and adequate insurance reserves are
maintained in connection  with such  self-insurance,  and,  notwithstanding  the
foregoing  provisions  of this  Section 5.04 the Company or any  Subsidiary  may
effect workers'  compensation  or similar  insurance in respect of operations in
any state or other jurisdiction either


                                      -48-

will,  and will cause each of the  Subsidiaries  to, keep proper books of record
and account in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and

will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  upon  reasonable  prior notice during
normal business hours, to visit and inspect its properties,  to examine and make
extracts from its books and records (subject to compliance with  confidentiality
agreements and applicable  copyright law), and to discuss its affairs,  finances
and condition with its officers and independent accountants,  all at such times,
and as often, as reasonably requested.

          SECTION 5.06    Compliance with Laws. The Company will, and will cause
each of the  Subsidiaries  to, comply with all Requirements of Law applicable to
it or its property,  except where the failure to do so,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  could not  reasonably  be expected  to result in a Material  Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 5.07    Use  of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds of the Loans will be
used only for (a) refinancing (i) amounts  outstanding under the Existing Credit
Agreement,  (ii) other  Indebtedness  of the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  and

                               NEGATIVE COVENANTS

      Until the Commitments  have expired or terminated and the principal of and
interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder have been paid in full, the
Company covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

          SECTION 6.01    Liens.  The  Company will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on any property
or asset now owned or hereafter  acquired by it, or assign or sell any income or
revenues  (including  accounts  receivable) or rights in respect of any thereof,
except:

          (a) Permitted Encumbrances;

          (b) Liens  existing on any property or asset prior to the  acquisition
     thereof by the Company or any  Subsidiary  or  existing on any  property or
     asset of any Person that becomes a  Subsidiary  after the date hereof prior
     to the time such Person  becomes a  Subsidiary  and  securing  Indebtedness
     whose incurrence,  for purposes of this Agreement, by virtue of acquisition
     of such  property  or  asset,  or by virtue of such  Person so  becoming  a
     Subsidiary, would not result in a violation of Section 6.06(a), (b), (c) or
     (d);  provided that (i) such Lien is not created in  contemplation of or in
     connection with such  acquisition or such Person becoming a Subsidiary,  as
     the case may be,  (ii) such Lien shall not apply to any other  property  or
     assets of the Company or any Subsidiary,  (iii) such Lien shall secure only
     those obligations which it secures on the date


                                      -49-
<PAGE>


of such  acquisition or the date such Person  becomes a Subsidiary,  as the case
may be, and extensions,  renewals and replacements  thereof that do not increase
the outstanding  principal amount thereof. For purposes of this Section 6.01(b),
the  Indebtedness  so secured  shall be deemed to have been incurred on the last
day of the fiscal quarter then most recently ended.

          (c) Liens,  not otherwise  permitted by the foregoing  clauses (a) and
(b),  securing  Indebtedness  and  payment  obligations  in  respect  of Hedging
Agreements in an aggregate amount not exceeding 10% of Tangible Net Worth.

          SECTION 6.02    Fundamental  Changes.  The  Company will not, and will
not permit any Subsidiary  to, merge into or consolidate  with any other Person,
or  permit  any  other  Person to merge  into or  consolidate  with it, or sell,
transfer,  lease or otherwise  dispose of (in one  transaction or in a series of
transactions) all (or substantially  all) of its assets, or all or substantially
all of the stock of or other equity interest in any of the Subsidiaries (in each
case,  whether now owned or  hereafter  acquired),  or  liquidate  or  dissolve,
unless:  (a) at the time thereof and immediately  after giving effect thereto no
Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be  continuing;  and (b) the
Company is the  surviving  entity or the  recipient of any such sale,  transfer,
lease  or  other  disposition  of  assets,   provided,   that  no  such  merger,
consolidation,  sale, transfer, lease or other disposition shall have the effect
of releasing the Company from any of the Obligations.

          SECTION 6.03    Restricted  Payments.  The Company  will not, and will
not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, declare or make, or agree to pay or make,
directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment.

          SECTION 6.04    Transactions  with  Affiliates.  The Company will not,
and will  not  permit  any of the  Subsidiaries  to,  sell,  lease or  otherwise
transfer any property or assets to, or purchase,  lease or otherwise acquire any
property or assets from, or otherwise engage in any other transactions with, any
of its  Affiliates,  except (a) in the ordinary course of business at prices and
on terms and  conditions  not less  favorable to the Company or such  Subsidiary
than could be obtained on an  arm's-length  basis from unrelated  third parties,
(b) transactions between or among the Company and the Wholly-owned  Subsidiaries
not involving  any other  Affiliate,  (c) any payment  which would  constitute a
Restricted Payment but for the proviso to the definition of said term in Section
1.01 and (d) loans and advances by the Company to the General  Partner to enable
the  General  Partner  to pay  general  and  administrative  costs and  expenses
pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Company and in accordance with past
practices.

          SECTION 6.05    Restrictive Agreements. The Company will not, and will
not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into, incur
or permit to exist any agreement or other arrangement that prohibits,  restricts
or imposes any condition  upon the ability of any Subsidiary to pay dividends or
other  distributions  with respect to any shares of its Capital Stock or to make
or repay loans or advances to the Company or any other such Subsidiary, provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to (a) restrictions and conditions imposed by
law or by  this  Agreement  or  the  Related  Credit  Agreement,  (b)  customary
restrictions and conditions  contained in agreements relating to the sale of all
or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of a Subsidiary pending such
sale,  provided such  restrictions  and conditions  apply only to the Subsidiary
that is to be sold and such sale is permitted hereunder, (c) restrictions and


                                      -50-
<PAGE>


conditions  existing on the date hereof  identified  on Schedule 6.05 (but shall
apply to any extension or renewal of, or any amendment or modification expanding
the scope of,  any such  restriction  or  condition)  and (d)  restrictions  and
conditions  contained in the agreement pursuant to which the SFPP First Mortgage
Notes were issued.

          SECTION 6.06    Financial  Covenants.  The  Company  will  observe and
cause the Subsidiaries to observe each of the following requirements:

          (a) Ratio of Consolidated  Indebtedness to  Consolidated  EBITDA.  The
Company will not at any time permit the ratio of  Consolidated  Indebtedness  to
Consolidated  EBITDA for the four full fiscal  quarters most  recently  ended in
respect of which  financial  statements  shall have been  delivered  pursuant to
Section  5.01(a) or (b), as the case may be, to exceed 5.00 to 1.0. For purposes
of this Section  6.06(a),  if during any period the Company  acquires any Person
(or any interest in any Person) or all or substantially all of the assets of any
Person,  the  EBITDA  attributable  to such  assets  or an  amount  equal to the
percentage  of  ownership of the Company in such Person times the EBITDA of such
Person, for such period determined on a pro forma basis (which determination, in
each case,  shall be subject to  approval  of the  Required  Lenders,  not to be
unreasonably  withheld) may be included as Consolidated  EBITDA for such period,
if on the date of such  acquisition  no  Indebtedness  (other than  Indebtedness
permitted  pursuant  to  Section  6.06(b) or (d)) is  incurred  by reason of and
giving effect to such acquisition and such Person,  or the entity acquiring such
assets,  as the case may be,  is a  Subsidiary.  For  purposes  of  ascertaining
whether  the  Required  Lenders  have  approved  a  determination  of the EBITDA
attributable  to  acquired  assets,  or the assets of an  acquired  Person,  for
inclusion  in  Consolidated  EBITDA for any  period  pursuant  to the  foregoing
sentence,  a Lender  which has not,  within 10 days  after  its  receipt  of the
certificate  of a Responsible  Officer  required by the last sentence of Section
5.01,  objected to the inclusion in Consolidated  EBITDA as set forth therein of
an amount of EBITDA  attributable  to such acquired assets or the assets of such
acquired  Person,  as the case may be, shall be deemed to have approved both the
determination of such amount of EBITDA so included, and the inclusion thereof in
Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to the foregoing sentence.

          (b)  Total  Indebtedness  (excluding  Indebtedness  of a  consolidated
Subsidiary  owed  to the  Company  or to  any  Wholly-owned  Subsidiary)  of all
consolidated   Subsidiaries   shall  at  no  time  exceed  15%  of  Consolidated
Indebtedness.

          (c) Tangible Net Worth as at the last day of any fiscal  quarter shall
not be less than $2,100,000,000.

          (d) Consolidated  Indebtedness  shall at no time exceed 62.5% of Total
Capitalization.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

following events ("Events of Default") shall occur and be continuing:

than an amount  referred to in clause (a) of this  Article)  payable  under this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  shall not be paid,  when and as the same
shall become due and payable,  and such failure shall continue  unremedied for a
period of three Business Days;

          (c) any  representation  or warranty  made or, for purposes of Article
III, deemed made by or on behalf of the Company herein,  at the direction of the
Company  or by the  Company  in any  other  Loan  Document  or in any  document,
certificate or financial  statement  delivered in connection with this Agreement

respect when made or deemed made or reaffirmed, as the case may be;

to which it is a party and, in any event,  such failure shall remain  unremedied

Section  7.01(b)) or any payment in respect of any Hedging  Agreement beyond any
period of grace provided with respect thereto (not to exceed 30 days);  provided

obligations  in respect  of all  Hedging  Agreements  as to which such a payment
default  shall occur and be continuing  is equal to or exceeds  $25,000,000,  or
(ii) the Company or any Subsidiary fails to duly observe, perform or comply with
any  agreement  with any Person or any term or condition of any  instrument,  if
such failure,  either  individually or in the aggregate,  shall have resulted in
the  acceleration of the payment of  Indebtedness  with an aggregate face amount
which is equal to or exceeds  $25,000,000;  provided  that this Section  7.01(f)
shall not apply to  secured  Indebtedness  that  becomes  due as a result of the
voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such  Indebtedness

decree  adjudicating  that any Plan must be  terminated;  or there shall occur a
complete  or  partial  withdrawal  from , or a default,  within  the  meaning of
Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA, with respect


                                      -53-
<PAGE>


to, one or more Multiemployer Plans which could cause one or more members of the
ERISA Group to incur a current payment obligation;  and in each of the foregoing
instances  such condition  could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect;

then, and in any such event, and at any time thereafter, if any Event of Default
shall then be continuing,  the  Administrative  Agent, may, and upon the written
request of the Required Lenders shall, by written notice  (including notice sent
by  telecopy)  to the  Company (a "Notice  of  Default")  take any or all of the
following actions,  without prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent,
any  Lender or other  holder of any of the  Obligations  to  enforce  its claims
against the Company  (provided that, if an Event of Default specified in Section
7.01(g) or  Section  7.01(h)  shall  occur  with  respect to the  Company or any
Subsidiary,  the  result of which  would  occur  upon the  giving of a Notice of
Default as  specified in clauses (i) and (ii) below,  shall occur  automatically
without the giving of any Notice of Default):  (i) declare the Total  Commitment
terminated,  whereupon the Commitments of the Lenders shall forthwith  terminate
immediately and any accrued facility fees shall forthwith become due and payable
without any other  notice of any kind;  (ii)  declare the  principal  of and any
accrued  interest in respect of all Loans, and all the other  Obligations  owing
hereunder and under the other Loan  Documents,  to be,  whereupon the same shall
become, forthwith due and payable without presentment,  demand, notice of demand
or of dishonor and nonpayment,  protest,  notice of protest, notice of intent to
accelerate,  declaration  or notice of  acceleration  or any other notice of any
kind,  all of which are hereby  waived by the  Company;  and (iii)  exercise any
rights or remedies under the Loan Documents.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

          SECTION 8.01    Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its agent
hereunder  and  under  the  other  Loan   Documents  with  such  powers  as  are
specifically  delegated  to the  Administrative  Agent  by  the  terms  of  this
Agreement and such other Loan Documents,  together with such other powers as are
reasonably  incidental thereto.  The Administrative Agent (which term as used in
this  sentence and in Section 8.05 and the first  sentence of Section 8.06 shall
include  reference to its Affiliates and its  Affiliates'  officers,  directors,
employees, attorneys, accountants, experts and agents): (a) shall have no duties
or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents,  and
shall not by reason of the Loan  Documents  be a trustee  or  fiduciary  for any
Lender;  (b) makes no  representation or warranty to any Lender and shall not be
responsible  to the Lenders for any  recitals,  statements,  representations  or
warranties contained in this Agreement,  or in any certificate or other document
referred  to or  provided  for  in,  or  received  by any of  them  under,  this
Agreement, or for the value, validity,  effectiveness,  genuineness,  execution,
legality,  enforceability  or  sufficiency  of this  Agreement,  any other  Loan
Document or any other document  referred to or provided for herein or therein or
for  any  failure  by  the  Company  or  any  other   Person   (other  than  the
Administrative  Agent) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder
or for the  existence  or value of, or the  perfection  or  priority of any Lien
upon,  any  collateral  security  or the  financial  or other  condition  of the
Company, the Subsidiaries or any other obligor or guarantor; (c) except pursuant
to Section 8.07 shall not be required to initiate or conduct any  litigation  or
collection proceedings


                                      -54-
<PAGE>


hereunder;  and (d) shall not be responsible  for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by it hereunder or under any other  document or instrument  referred to
or provided  for herein or in  connection  herewith  including  its own ordinary
negligence, except for its own gross negligence,  willful misconduct or unlawful
conduct. The Administrative Agent may employ agents, accountants,  attorneys and
experts and shall not be  responsible  for the  negligence  or misconduct of any
such agents,  accountants,  attorneys or experts selected by it in good faith or
any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in  accordance  with
the advice of such agents, accountants, attorneys or experts. The Administrative
Agent may deem and treat the payee  named in any Note as the holder  thereof for
all  purposes  hereof  unless and until a written  notice of the  assignment  or
transfer   thereof   permitted   hereunder   shall  have  been  filed  with  the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent is authorized to release any cash
collateral  that is  permitted  to be  released  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement.

          SECTION  8.02    Reliance by Administrative  Agent. The Administrative
Agent  shall  be  entitled  to rely  upon  any  certification,  notice  or other
communication (including any thereof by telephone,  telex, telecopier,  telegram
or cable)  believed  by it to be genuine  and correct and to have been signed or
sent by or on behalf  of the  proper  Person or  Persons,  and upon  advice  and
statements of legal counsel,  independent accountants and other experts selected
by the Administrative Agent in good faith.

          SECTION 8.03    Defaults;  Events of Default. The Administrative Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event
of Default  (other than the  non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans or
of fees) unless the  Administrative  Agent has received  notice from a Lender or
the Company  specifying  such  Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "Notice  of  Default."  In the event that the  Administrative  Agent
receives such a notice of the  occurrence of a Default or Event of Default,  the
Administrative  Agent shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the Lenders.  In the
event of a payment Default or Event of Default,  the Administrative  Agent shall
give each Lender prompt notice of each such payment Default or Event of Default.

          SECTION 8.04    Rights  as  a Lender.  With respect to its Commitments
and the Loans made by it, Wachovia (and any successor  acting as  Administrative
Agent),  in its  capacity as a Lender  hereunder  shall have the same rights and
powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not acting as the  Administrative  Agent,  and the term  "Lender"  or  "Lenders"
shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,  include the Administrative Agent
in its individual capacity. Wachovia (and any successor acting as Administrative
Agent),  and its  Affiliates  may  (without  having to account  therefor  to any
Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally  engage in any kind of
banking, trust or other business with the Company (and any of its Affiliates) as
if it were not acting as the Administrative  Agent.  Wachovia and its Affiliates
may  accept  fees and other  consideration  from the  Company  for  services  in
connection  with this  Agreement or otherwise  without having to account for the
same to the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.05    INDEMNIFICATION.  THE  LENDERS  AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT, THE SYNDICATION AGENT AND THE DOCUMENTATION AGENT RATABLY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR  APPLICABLE  PERCENTAGES  FOR THE INDEMNITY  MATTERS AS
DESCRIBED


                                      -55-
<PAGE>


IN SECTION 9.03 TO THE EXTENT NOT INDEMNIFIED OR REIMBURSED BY THE COMPANY UNDER
SECTION 9.03,  BUT WITHOUT  LIMITING THE  OBLIGATIONS  OF THE COMPANY UNDER SAID
SECTION  9.03  AND  FOR  ANY AND ALL  OTHER  LIABILITIES,  OBLIGATIONS,  LOSSES,
DAMAGES, PENALTIES,  ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS
OF ANY KIND AND  NATURE  WHATSOEVER  WHICH MAY BE  IMPOSED  ON,  INCURRED  BY OR
ASSERTED  AGAINST  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT,  THE  SYNDICATION  AGENT  OR  THE
DOCUMENTATION AGENT IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF: (A) THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY  OTHER  LOAN  DOCUMENT  CONTEMPLATED  BY OR  REFERRED  TO  HEREIN  OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, BUT EXCLUDING, UNLESS A DEFAULT OR AN EVENT OF
DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING, NORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND EXPENSES
INCIDENT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS AGENCY DUTIES,  IF ANY,  HEREUNDER OR (B) THE
ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OF ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT;
WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THE  FOREGOING  SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 8.05 ARISES FROM
THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT, THE SYNDICATION
AGENT OR THE  DOCUMENTATION  AGENT,  AS THE CASE MAY BE; PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER
SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOREGOING TO THE EXTENT THEY ARISE FROM THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE,  WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR UNLAWFUL CONDUCT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
THE SYNDICATION AGENT OR THE DOCUMENTATION AGENT.

          SECTION 8.06    Non-Reliance  on Agents and other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that it has,  independently  and without reliance on the
Administrative  Agent,  the Syndication  Agent, the  Documentation  Agent or any
other  Lender,  and based on such  documents  and  information  as it has deemed
appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis of the Company and the  Subsidiaries
and its decision to enter into this Agreement,  and that it will,  independently
and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent, the Syndication Agent, the
Documentation  Agent  or any  other  Lender,  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
analysis  and  decisions in taking or not taking  action  under this  Agreement.
Neither the  Administrative  Agent, the Syndication  Agent nor the Documentation
Agent  shall be  required  to keep  itself  informed  as to the  performance  or
observance  by the Company of this  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents or any
other  document  referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the properties
or books of the Company.  Except for notices,  reports and other  documents  and
information   expressly   required  to  be  furnished  to  the  Lenders  by  the
Administrative   Agent  hereunder,   neither  the   Administrative   Agent,  the
Syndication  Agent  nor  the   Documentation   Agent  shall  have  any  duty  or
responsibility  to  provide  any  Lender  with any  credit or other  information
concerning the affairs,  financial  condition or business of the Company (or any
of its  Affiliates)  which may come into the  possession  of the  Administrative
Agent, the Syndication  Agent, the Documentation  Agent or any of its respective
Affiliates. In this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Andrews & Kurth L.L.P.
is acting in this  transaction as special  counsel to the  Administrative  Agent
only.  Each Lender will consult with its own legal counsel to the extent that it
deems  necessary in connection  with this Agreement and other Loan Documents and
the matters contemplated herein and therein.

          SECTION 8.07    Action  by  Administrative Agent. Except for action or
other matters  expressly  required of the  Administrative  Agent hereunder,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall in all  cases  be fully  justified  in  failing  or
refusing to act hereunder unless it shall (a) receive written  instructions from
the  Required  Lenders (or all of the Lenders as  expressly  required by Section
9.02)  specifying  the  action  to be  taken,  and  (b)  be  indemnified  to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
instructions  of the  Required  Lenders  (or  all of the  Lenders  as  expressly
required  by  Section  9.02) and any action  taken or  failure  to act  pursuant
thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If a
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,  the  Administrative
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall be directed by the Required  Lenders (or all of the Lenders as required by
Section 9.02) in the written  instructions (with indemnities)  described in this
Section 8.07;  provided that,  unless and until the  Administrative  Agent shall
have received such directions,  the  Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such  Default  or Event of Default  as it shall  deem  advisable  in the best
interests of the Lenders. In no event,  however,  shall the Administrative Agent
be  required  to take any  action  which  exposes  the  Administrative  Agent to
personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.

          SECTION 8.08    Resignation   or   Removal  of  Administrative  Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice
thereof to the  Lenders and the  Company,  and the  Administrative  Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal,  the Required  Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor  Administrative  Agent  (so long as no  Default  or  Event of  Default
exists) with the prior written  consent of the Company  (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). If no successor  Administrative Agent shall have been
so appointed by the Required  Lenders and shall have accepted  such  appointment
within  thirty (30) days after the  retiring  Administrative  Agent's  giving of
notice  of  resignation  or  the  Required  Lenders'  removal  of  the  retiring
Administrative  Agent, then the retiring  Administrative Agent may, on behalf of
the Lenders,  appoint a successor Administrative Agent (so long as no Default or
Event of Default  exists) with the prior written  consent of the Company  (which
consent  shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld).  Upon  the  acceptance  of such
appointment  hereunder  by a  successor  Administrative  Agent,  such  successor
Administrative  Agent shall thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from its  duties and
obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or
removal hereunder as  Administrative  Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII
and  Section  9.03 shall  continue  in effect for its  benefit in respect of any
actions  taken  or  omitted  to be  taken  by it  while  it  was  acting  as the
Administrative Agent.

          SECTION  8.09    Duties of Syndication Agent and Documentation  Agent.
Notwithstanding  the indemnity of the  Syndication  Agent and the  Documentation
Agent contained in Section 8.05 and in Section 9.03,  nothing  contained in this
Agreement  shall be construed to impose any obligation or duty whatsoever on any
Person named on the cover of this  Agreement  or elsewhere in this  Agreement as
Syndication  Agent,  Documentation  Agent,  Joint  Lead  Arranger  or Joint Book
Manager, other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01    Notices, Etc.

          (a) The  Administrative  Agent, any Lender or the holder of any of the
Obligations,  giving  consent  or notice or making any  request  of the  Company
provided  for  hereunder,   shall  notify  each  Lender  (in  the  case  of  the
Administrative  Agent)  and the  Administrative  Agent (in the case of a Lender)
thereof.  In the event  that the  holder  of any Note or any of the  Obligations
(including  any  Lender)  shall  transfer  such  Note or  Obligations,  it shall
promptly  so advise the  Administrative  Agent which shall be entitled to assume
conclusively  that no  transfer of any Note or any of the  Obligations  has been
made by any holder  (including any Lender)  unless and until the  Administrative
Agent receives written notice to the contrary.

          (b) Except with respect to notices and other communications  expressly
permitted to be given by telephone, all notices, consents, requests,  approvals,
demands and other communications  (collectively  "Communications")  provided for

                             Attention: Russell Clingman
                             Telecopy No.: (713)-650-6354;

          (iii)  if to any  other  Lender,  to it at its  address  (or  telecopy

     Person to the  Administrative  Agent or in the  Assignment  and  Acceptance
     executed by such Person;

or, in the case of any party hereto,  such other  address or telecopy  number as
such  party  may  hereafter  specify  for such  purpose  by  notice to the other
parties.

          (c)  Communications  to the  Lenders  hereunder  may be  delivered  or
furnished by electronic  communications  pursuant to procedures  approved by the
Administrative  Agent;  provided that the  foregoing  shall not apply to notices
pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the  Administrative  Agent and
the  applicable  Lender.  The  Administrative  Agent or the Company  may, in its
discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it


                                      -58-
<PAGE>


hereunder by electronic  communications  pursuant to procedures  approved by it;
provided that approval of such  procedures may be limited to particular  notices
or communications.

          (d) Any party  hereto may change its  address or  telecopy  number for
notices  and other  communications  hereunder  by  notice  to the other  parties
hereto.  All  notices  and other  communications  given to any  party  hereto in
accordance  with the provisions of this  Agreement  shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt.

          SECTION 9.02    Waivers;  Amendments.  (a) No  failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising,  and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor
shall  any  single  or  partial  exercise  of any such  right or  power,  or any
abandonment  or  discontinuance  of steps  to  enforce  such a right  or  power,
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right or power.  No notice to or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle
the  Company  to any other or  further  notice or  demand  in  similar  or other
circumstances.  No waiver of any  provision of this  Agreement or consent to any
departure  therefrom  shall in any event be  effective  unless the same shall be
permitted by Section 9.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the  specific  instance  and for the  purpose for which  given.  Without
limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  the making of a Loan shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default,  regardless of whether
the Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

          (b) No provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document may be
waived,  amended or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements in
writing  entered into by the Company and the Required  Lenders or by the Company
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;  provided
that no such  agreement  shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or reduce the rate of interest thereon,  or reduce any fees payable hereunder or
under the Fee  Letter  without  the  written  consent  of each  Lender  affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of
any Loan (including any payment required  pursuant to Section  2.10(b)),  or any
interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder,  or reduce the amount of, waive
or excuse any such payment,  or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment,  without the written consent of each Lender affected  thereby,  (iv)
change Section  2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v)
change  any of the  provisions  of this  Section  9.02(b),  Section  9.05 or the
definition of "Required  Lenders" or any other provision  hereof  specifying the
number or  percentage of Lenders  required to waive,  amend or modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder,  without the
written  consent of each Lender;  provided  further that no such agreement shall
amend,  modify or  otherwise  affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative
Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 9.03    Payment of Expenses, Indemnities, etc. The
Company agrees:

          (a) to pay all reasonable expenses of the Administrative  Agent in the
administration  (including  advice of counsel as to the rights and duties of the

amendment,  waiver or consent relating thereto  (including,  without limitation,
travel, photocopy, mailing, courier, telephone and other similar expenses of the
Administrative Agent, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and other
outside consultants for the Administrative Agent and, in the case of enforcement
of this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents,  the  reasonable  fees  and
disbursements  of counsel,  including the allocated  costs of inside counsel for
the  Administrative   Agent  and  each  Lender);   and  promptly  reimburse  the
Administrative  Agent for all  amounts  expended,  advanced  or  incurred by the
Administrative  Agent or the  Lenders to satisfy any  obligation  of the Company
under this Agreement.

          (b) TO INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT, THE SYNDICATION AGENT, THE
DOCUMENTATION  AGENT AND EACH  LENDER AND EACH OF THEIR  AFFILIATES  AND EACH OF
THEIR  OFFICERS,  DIRECTORS,  EMPLOYEES,  REPRESENTATIVES,   AGENTS,  ATTORNEYS,

PROPOSED  USE BY THE  COMPANY  OF THE  PROCEEDS  OF ANY OF THE  LOANS,  (II) THE
EXECUTION,  DELIVERY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (III) THE OPERATIONS

PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY INVESTIGATIONS,  LITIGATION OR INQUIRIES) OR CLAIM AND
INCLUDING ALL INDEMNITY MATTERS ARISING BY REASON OF THE ORDINARY  NEGLIGENCE OF
ANY  INDEMNIFIED  PARTY,  BUT EXCLUDING ALL INDEMNITY  MATTERS ARISING SOLELY BY
REASON OF CLAIMS BETWEEN THE LENDERS OR ANY LENDER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
THE SYNDICATION  AGENT, OR THE  DOCUMENTATION  AGENT OR A LENDER'S  SHAREHOLDERS
AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR LENDER OR BY REASON OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE,
WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT  OR UNLAWFUL  CONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE  INDEMNIFIED  PARTY
SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION.

          (c) TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD  HARMLESS FROM TIME TO TIME THE  INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES,

STORAGE,  TREATMENT  OR  DISPOSAL  OF  HAZARDOUS  MATERIALS  ON OR AT ANY OF THE
PROPERTIES OWNED OR OPERATED BY THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY,  OR (V) ANY OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY CONDITION IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          (d) No  Indemnified  Party  may  settle  any  claim to be  indemnified
without  the consent of the  indemnitor,  such  consent  not to be  unreasonably
withheld;  provided,  that the indemnitor may not reasonably withhold consent to
any settlement that an Indemnified  Party  proposes,  if the indemnitor does not
have the financial  ability to pay all its obligations  outstanding and asserted
against the  indemnitor  at that time,  including the maximum  potential  claims
against the Indemnified Party to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.03.

          (e) In the case of any indemnification  hereunder,  the Administrative
Agent or Lender,  as  appropriate  shall give  notice to the Company of any such
claim or demand being made against the  Indemnified  Party and the Company shall
have the  non-exclusive  right to join in the defense  against any such claim or
demand;  provided that if the Company provides a defense,  the Indemnified Party
shall  bear its own cost of  defense  unless  there is a  conflict  between  the
Company and such Indemnified Party.

          (f) THE FOREGOING  INDEMNITIES SHALL EXTEND TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
NOTWITHSTANDING  THE SOLE OR  CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE  OF EVERY KIND OR CHARACTER
WHATSOEVER,  WHETHER  ACTIVE  OR  PASSIVE,  WHETHER  AN  AFFIRMATIVE  ACT  OR AN
OMISSION,   INCLUDING,   ALL  TYPES  OF  NEGLIGENT  CONDUCT  IDENTIFIED  IN  THE
RESTATEMENT  (SECOND) OF TORTS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE  INDEMNIFIED  PARTIES OR BY
REASON  OF  STRICT  LIABILITY  IMPOSED  WITHOUT  FAULT ON ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
INDEMNIFIED  PARTIES.  TO THE EXTENT THAT AN INDEMNIFIED  PARTY IS FOUND TO HAVE
COMMITTED  AN ACT OF GROSS  NEGLIGENCE  OR  WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT  OR  ENGAGED  IN
UNLAWFUL CONDUCT, THIS CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATION OF INDEMNIFICATION SHALL CONTINUE
BUT  SHALL  ONLY  EXTEND  TO THE  PORTION  OF THE  CLAIM  THAT IS DEEMED TO HAVE
OCCURRED BY REASON OF EVENTS OTHER THAN THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT

          (g) The  Company's  obligations  under this Section 9.03 shall survive
any  termination  of this  Agreement  and the  payment  of the  Loans  and shall
continue thereafter in full force and effect, for a period of six years.

          (h) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the  Administrative  Agent under this Section 9.03, each Lender
severally  agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent such Lender's  Applicable
Percentage  (determined as of the time that the applicable  unreimbursed expense
or  indemnity  payment is  sought)  of such  unpaid  amount;  provided  that the
unreimbursed  expense or indemnified loss, claim,  damage,  liability or related
expense,  as  the  case  may  be,  was  incurred  by  or  asserted  against  the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

          (i) The  Company  shall pay any amounts  due under this  Section  9.03
within  thirty  (30) days of the  receipt by the Company of notice of the amount
due.

          SECTION 9.04    Successors  and  Assigns.  The   provisions  of   this
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto
and their respective  successors and assigns permitted  hereby.  Nothing in this
Agreement,  expressed  or implied,  shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other  than  the  parties  hereto,  their  respective  successors  and  assigns
permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly  contemplated  hereby, the Related
Parties  of each of the  Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders)  any  legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.05    Assignments and Participations.

          (a) The Company may not assign its rights or obligations  hereunder or
under  the  Notes  without  the  prior  consent  of all of the  Lenders  and the
Administrative Agent.

          (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations  under this Agreement  (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);  provided that (i) except
in the case of an  assignment  to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender,  each of
the Company and the  Administrative  Agent must give their prior written consent
to such  assignment  (which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld),  (ii)
except in the case of an  assignment  to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or
an  assignment  of  the  entire  remaining  amount  of  the  assigning  Lender's
Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
such  assignment  (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance  with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the  Administrative  Agent) shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative  Agent
otherwise consent,  (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
of a  proportionate  part of all the assigning  Lender's  rights and obligations
under this  Agreement,  (iv) the parties to each  assignment  shall  execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,  together with
a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each such assignment, and (v) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an  Administrative  Questionnaire;  provided  further  that any  consent  of the
Company  otherwise  required under this Section 9.05(b) shall not be required if
an  Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing.  Upon  acceptance  and
recording  pursuant  to  Section  9.05(d),  from and  after the  effective  date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance,


                                      -62-
<PAGE>


the  assignee  thereunder  shall be a party  hereto  and,  to the  extent of the
interest  assigned  by such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  have the  rights  and
obligations  of  a  Lender  under  this  Agreement,  and  the  assigning  Lender
thereunder  shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance,  be released from its obligations  under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  covering all of the  assigning  Lender's
rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15,
2.16,  2.17 and  9.03).  Any  assignment  or  transfer  by a Lender of rights or
obligations  under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be  treated  for  purposes  of this  Agreement  as a sale by  such  Lender  of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.05(e).

          (c) The Administrative  Agent,  acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices in Charlotte, North Carolina a
copy of each  Assignment and  Acceptance  delivered to it and a register for the
recordation  of the names and addresses of the Lenders,  and the  Commitment of,
and  principal  amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender  pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive,  and the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary.  The Register  shall be available for inspection by the Company
and any Lender,  at any  reasonable  time and from time to time upon  reasonable
prior notice.

          (d) Upon its receipt of a duly  completed  Assignment  and  Acceptance
executed  by an  assigning  Lender and an  assignee,  the  assignee's  completed
Administrative  Questionnaire  (unless the  assignee  shall  already be a Lender
hereunder),  the processing and  recordation  fee referred to in Section 9.05(b)
and any written  consent to such  assignment  required by Section  9.05(b),  the
Administrative  Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the
information  contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this  Agreement  unless it has been  recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph.

          (e)  Any  Lender  may,  without  the  consent  of the  Company  or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a  "Participant")  in all or a portion of such Lender's  rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it);  provided that (i) such Lender's  obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other  parties  hereto for the  performance  of such  obligations  and (iii) the
Company,  the Administrative  Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation  shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the  sole  right  to  enforce  this  Agreement  and to  approve  any  amendment,
modification  or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement;  provided that such
agreement  or  instrument  may provide  that such  Lender will not,  without the
consent  of the  Participant,  agree to any  amendment,  modification  or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to Section 9.05(f),  the Company agrees that each  Participant  shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections  2.15,  2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as
if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to


                                      -63-
<PAGE>


Section 9.05(b),  and be indemnified  under Section 9.03 as if it were a Lender.
In addition, each agreement creating any participation must include an agreement
by the Participant to be bound by the provisions of Section 9.12.

          (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the  applicable  Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation  sold to such  Participant,  unless
the sale of the  participation  to such  Participant  is made with the Company's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender  shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company
is notified of the  participation  sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though
it were a Lender.

          (g) The Lenders may furnish any information  concerning the Company in
the  possession of the Lenders from time to time to assignees  and  Participants
(including prospective assignees and participants);  provided that, such Persons
agree to be bound by the provisions of Section 9.12 hereof.

          (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.05 to the contrary, any
Lender may assign and pledge its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United
States  Treasury  as  collateral  security  pursuant  to  Regulation  A and  any
operating  circular  issued by such Federal  Reserve  System and/or such Federal
Reserve  Bank.  No such  assignment  and/or  pledge shall  release the assigning
and/or pledging Lender from its obligations hereunder.

          (i)  Notwithstanding  any other  provisions  of this Section  9.05, no
transfer or  assignment  of the  interests or  obligations  of any Lender or any
grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer,  assignment
or grant would require the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC
or to qualify the Loans under the "Blue Sky" laws of any state.

          SECTION 9.06   Survival; Reinstatement. (a) All covenants, agreements,
representations   and  warranties   made  by  the  Company  herein  and  in  the
certificates  or other  instruments  delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement and the
making of any  Loans,  regardless  of any  investigation  made by any such other
party or on its behalf and notwithstanding  that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or  knowledge  of any  Default or Event of Default or
incorrect  representation  or  warranty  at the  time  any  credit  is  extended
hereunder,  and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued  interest on any Loan or any fee or any other  amount  payable
under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid so long as the  Commitments  have
not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03
and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby, the repayment of the
Loans,  the expiration or termination of the  Commitments or the  termination of
this Agreement or any provision hereof.

          (b)  To  the  extent  that  any  payments  on  the   Obligations   are
subsequently invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or preferential,  set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee,  debtor in possession,  receiver or other
Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or


                                      -64-
<PAGE>


equitable  cause,  then to such extent,  the  Obligations so satisfied  shall be
revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received.

          SECTION 9.07    Counterparts;    Integration;    Effectiveness.   This
Agreement may be executed in  counterparts  (and by different  parties hereto on
different counterparts),  each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall  constitute a single  contract.  This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter constitute the entire contract among
the parties  hereto  relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all previous  agreements and  understandings,  oral or written,  relating to the
subject matter hereof (including the Information Memorandum). Except as provided
in Section 3.01, this Agreement  shall become  effective when it shall have been
executed by the  Administrative  Agent and when the  Administrative  Agent shall
have  received  counterparts  hereof  which,  when  taken  together,   bear  the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto,  and thereafter shall be binding
upon and  inure to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and  their  respective
successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this  Agreement  by  telecopy  shall be  effective  as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.08    Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable  in any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to such
jurisdiction,  be  ineffective to the extent of such  invalidity,  illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity,  legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a  particular  jurisdiction  shall not  invalidate  such  provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION  9.09    Right  of Setoff.  If an Event of Default  shall have
occurred and be  continuing,  each Lender is hereby  authorized  at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final)
at any time held and other  indebtedness  at any time owing by such Lender to or
for  the  credit  or the  account  of the  Company  against  any of and  all the
Obligations  now or hereafter  existing  under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents held by such Lender,  irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such  Obligations  may be
unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.09 are in addition to
other rights and remedies  (including  other rights of setoff) which such Lender
may have.

          SECTION 9.10    Governing  Law;  Jurisdiction;  Consent to  Service of
Process.

          (a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents  shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York.

directors,  officers and  employees  and to its agents,  including  accountants,

                                      -67-
<PAGE>


(collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum
Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,  taken, received or reserved by the
Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest
payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,  together with all Charges payable in
respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful,
the  interest  and Charges  that would have been payable in respect of such Loan
but were not payable as a result of the  operation of this Section 9.13 shall be
cumulated  and the  interest  and  Charges  payable to such Lender in respect of
other  Loans or  periods  shall be  increased  (but not above the  Maximum  Rate
therefor)  until such cumulated  amount,  together with interest  thereon at the
Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment,  shall have been received

THE OTHER PARTY OF ITS  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR SUCH  LIABILITY.  EACH PARTY  HERETO
AGREES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR  ENFORCEABILITY OF
ANY  EXCULPATORY  PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD NO
NOTICE  OR   KNOWLEDGE  OF  SUCH   PROVISION  OR  THAT  THE   PROVISION  IS  NOT
