of the Purchased Assets prior to the Effective Time is covered by the MLP
Insurance Policies. MRY3 also acknowledges and agrees that, following the
Effective Time, the MLP Insurance Policies may be terminated or modified by MLP
or its Affiliates to the extent necessary to exclude coverage of any occurrences
related to the Purchased Assets that occur after the Effective Time and MRY3
shall be obligated at or before the Effective Time to obtain at its sole cost
and expense insurance to cover occurrences that occur after the Effective Time,
