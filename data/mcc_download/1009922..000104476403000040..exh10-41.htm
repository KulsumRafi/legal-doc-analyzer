<LI>A "Control Acquisition" by an "Acquiring Person" where, immediately after the subject acquisition, such Acquiring Person holds beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities. The terms in quotations in the immediately preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this Agreement, have the following meanings:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>"Acquiring Person" shall mean any person which acquires the defined percentage of securities, with the exception of: (i) any Employee Benefit Plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company, or by any corporation or entity in which the Company holds fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities (each, a "Controlled Subsidiary"); (ii) the Company or any Controlled Subsidiary; or (iii) any person which acquires the threshold percentage of voting securities through a "Non-Control Transaction" (as defined below).</LI>
<LI>"Non-Control Transaction" shall mean any transaction in which the stockholders of the Company immediately before such transaction, directly or indirectly own immediately following such transaction at least a majority of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving corporation (or other entity) resulting from such transaction, in substantially the same proportion as such stockholders' ownership of the Company's voting securities immediately before such transaction. &nbsp;</LI></OL>

<LI>During any period of three (3) consecutive years after the date of this Agreement, the individuals who constituted the Board at the beginning of such period (the "Incumbent Board") cease to constitute a majority of the Board, for any reason(s) other than (i) the voluntary resignation of one or more Board members; (ii) the refusal by one or more Board members to stand for election to the Board; and/or (iii) the removal of one or more Board members for good cause; provided, however, (a) that if the nomination or election of any new director of the Company was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall be deemed a member of the Incumbent Board; and (b) that no individual shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), or as a result of a solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of an Acquiring Person, other than a member of the Board (a "Proxy Contest"), or as a result of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or<A NAME="_Ref408302742"></LI>

<LI>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Executive or an affiliate of the Executive who is then a stockholder or director of the Company, either: (i) expressly voted in favor of the transaction constituting the Change In Control in such person's capacity as either a stockholder or as a director of the Company; or (ii) expressly abstained from voting (other than by reason of an "interest" in a matter or transaction, as defined in the Nevada Revised Statutes); and/or (iii) failed or refused to vote, then the transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control.</LI></OL>
