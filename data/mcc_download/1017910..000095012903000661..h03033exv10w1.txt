EXHIBIT 10.1

The Board of Directors
Petsec Energy Ltd

                         CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

We consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement on
Form S-8 (No. 333-6128) of Petsec Energy Ltd of our report dated March 28, 2002
, relating to the consolidated balance sheets of Petsec Energy Ltd and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of
the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2001 which report appears
in the December 31, 2001 annual report on Form 20-F of Petsec Energy Ltd.

In our report dated April 15, 2000, we did not express an opinion on the 1999
financial statements due to material uncertainties relating to the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. These uncertainties arose as a result of
the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Petsec Energy Inc. ("PEI") being in
default of its borrowing covenants. As disclosed in Note 9(a) of the 1999
financial statements, PEI filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of this filing control over PEI became
impaired and consequently PEI was deconsolidated as of that date. On January 16,
2001, PEI emerged as a re-organised entity under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
resulting in the settlement of all outstanding claims and the discharge of all
liabilities of PEI. Accordingly, our present opinion on the 1999 financial
statements, as presented herein, is different from our previous report.
