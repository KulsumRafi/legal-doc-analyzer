<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT    <BR>  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Restricted Stock Agreement (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Restricted Stock Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") is made and entered into as of
[Date] (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Date of Grant</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by and between Health Net,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and [Name] (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Recipient</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Committee</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the Board of Directors (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Board</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the Company has approved the grant of Restricted Stock, as hereinafter defined, to the Recipient as set forth below under the Company's
[Year] Stock Option Plan (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Grant of Restricted Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Company hereby grants to the Recipient [Number] restricted shares
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Restricted Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>")
of the Company, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Restricted Stock Agreement. As a condition of the effectiveness of this grant, the Recipient shall pay to the Company as soon as
practicable the par value in cash for each share of Restricted Stock subject to this grant. The Recipient's grant and record of share ownership shall be kept on the books of the Company, until the
restrictions on transfer have lapsed pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 below. Shares that have become vested pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 below may be evidenced by stock certificates, at the request of the
Recipient, which certificates shall be registered in the name of the Recipient and delivered to Recipient within ten (10)&nbsp;days of such request. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Lapse of Restrictions</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;3 hereof, the restrictions on transfer set forth in
Section&nbsp;4 hereof shall lapse (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Vesting Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") with respect to all shares of the Restricted Stock on the [Number]
anniversary of the Grant Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Termination of Service</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
prior to the Vesting Date, the Recipient's employment or service with the Company is terminated by either the Recipient or the Company for any reason (a
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Termination Event</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), then all shares of Restricted Stock not yet vested shall
be immediately forfeited at such time, and the Company shall return to the Recipient an amount equal to the par value of the Restricted Stock which was paid by the Recipient to the Company as
described in Section&nbsp;1 above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Recipient violates the terms of Section&nbsp;5 of this Agreement (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Breach Event</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), in addition to being subject
to all remedies in law or equity that the Company may assert, then at any time thereafter the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, may, with respect to any Restricted Stock that has vested
within six (6)&nbsp;months of the Recipient's termination of employment: (i)&nbsp;to the extent that the Restricted Stock is beneficially owned by the Recipient, reacquire from the Recipient, in
return for an amount equal to the par value of the Restricted Stock which was paid by the Recipient to the Company as described in Section&nbsp;1 above, any or all of the shares of Restricted Stock;
and (ii)&nbsp;to the extent that the Restricted Stock has been sold, assigned or otherwise transferred by the Recipient, recover from the Recipient an amount equal to the Gain Realized (as defined
in Section&nbsp;5 below) from such sale, assignment or transfer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the occurrence of a Breach Event, the Company may elect to purchase all or any portion of the Restricted Stock pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3 by delivery of
written notice (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Repurchase Notice</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to the Recipient within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the occurrence of such Breach Event. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Restrictions on Transfer</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Unless earlier vested pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 above, shares of Restricted Stock may not be
transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Recipient prior to [Date], including by way of sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or otherwise except by will or the laws of descent
and distribution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Employment/Association with Company Competitor</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Recipient hereby agrees that, during (i)&nbsp;the
six-month period following a termination of the Recipient's employment with an Employer that entitles the Recipient to receive severance benefits under an agreement with or the policy of
the Company or (ii)&nbsp;the twelve-month period following a termination of the Recipient's employment with an Employer that does not entitle the Recipient to receive such severance benefits (the
period referred to in either clause&nbsp;(i) or (ii), the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Noncompetition Period</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), the Recipient shall not undertake any employment or activity
(including, but not limited to, consulting services) with a Competitor (as defined below), where the loyal and complete fulfillment of the duties of the competitive employment or activity would call
upon the Recipient to reveal, to make judgments on or otherwise use any confidential business information or trade secrets of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary to which the Recipient had
access during the Recipient's employment with the Employer. In addition, the Recipient agrees that, during the Noncompetion Period applicable to the Recipient following termination of employment with
the Employer, the Recipient shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, interfere with, hire, offer to hire or induce any person, who is or was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
during the 12&nbsp;month period prior to the date of such termination of employment, to discontinue his or her relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to accept employment by, or
enter into a business relationship with, the Recipient or any other entity or person. In the event that the Recipient breaches the covenants set forth in this first paragraph of Section&nbsp;5, it
shall be considered a Breach Event under Section&nbsp;3 above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;5: "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Gain Realized</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall equal the difference between (x)&nbsp;the par value paid by the Recipient for
the Restricted Stock and (y)&nbsp;the greater of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Common Stock representing the Restricted Stock (I)&nbsp;on the date of transfer of such
Restricted Stock or (II)&nbsp;on the date such competitive activity with a Competitor was commenced by the Recipient; and "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Competitor</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall refer to
any health maintenance organization or insurance company that provides managed health care or related services similar to those provided by the Company or any Subsidiary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is hereby further agreed that if any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the restrictions imposed in this Section&nbsp;5 are unreasonable (including, but not
limited to, the definition of Market Area or Competitor or the time period during which this provision is applicable), the parties hereto hereby agree to any restrictions that such court would find to
be reasonable under the circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Recipient acknowledges that the services to be rendered by the Recipient to the Company are of a special and unique character, which gives this Agreement a peculiar value to the
Company, the loss of which may not be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages in an action at law, and that a material breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of any of the provisions
contained in this Section&nbsp;5 will cause the Company irreparable injury. Recipient therefore agrees that the Company may be entitled, in addition to the remedies set forth above in this
Section&nbsp;5 and any other right or remedy, to a temporary, preliminary and permanent injunction, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages or the posting of any bond or
security, enjoining or restraining Recipient from any such violations or threatened violations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Rights as a Stockholder</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Company shall hold in escrow all dividends, if any, that are paid with respect to the shares of
Restricted Stock until all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. Recipient agrees that the right to vote any shares for which the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section&nbsp;4 hereof have
not yet lapsed (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Unvested Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") will be held by the Company and, accordingly, the Employee shall execute an irrevocable proxy in favor of the
Company for all shares of Restricted Stock in the form supplied by the Company. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Notices</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Any notice or communication given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by fax or first class mail,

SIZE=2><I>Securities Laws Requirements</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Company shall not be obligated to transfer any shares of Common Stock from the Recipient
to another party, if such transfer, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, would violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Securities
Act</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") (or any other federal or state statutes having similar requirements as may be in effect at that time). Further, the Company may require as a condition of transfer of any
shares to the Recipient that the Recipient furnish a written representation that he or she is holding the shares for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution to the public. The Company
either has or will file an appropriate Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-8 (or other applicable form), and has taken or will take such actions as necessary to keep the information
therein current from time to time, in order to register the Restricted Stock under the Securities Act and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Protections Against Violations of Restricted Stock Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. No purported sale, assignment, mortgage, hypothecation,
transfer, pledge, encumbrance, gift, transfer in trust (voting or other) or other disposition of, or creation of a security interest in or lien on, any of the shares of Restricted Stock by any holder
thereof in violation of the provisions of this Restricted Stock Agreement or the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, shall be valid, and the Company will not
transfer any of said shares of Restricted Stock on its books nor will any of said shares of Restricted Stock be entitled to vote, nor will any dividends be paid thereon, unless and until there has
been full compliance with said provisions to the satisfaction of the Company. The foregoing restrictions are in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies, legal or equitable, available to
enforce said provisions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Recipient understands that he or she (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax obligation that may
arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Restricted Stock Agreement and shall pay to the Company the amount determined by the Company to be such tax obligation at the time such tax
obligation arises. If the Recipient fails to make such payment, the number of shares necessary to satisfy the tax obligations shall be forfeited. The Recipient shall promptly notify the Company of any
election made pursuant to Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>THE

applicable to the Restricted Stock in the event of a Change in Control, as such term is defined in the Plan. The Recipient hereby acknowledges that the Committee retains the right to determine whether
the acceleration of vesting provided for in said Section&nbsp;6.8 shall have occurred with respect to the Restricted Stock (notwithstanding the provisions of such Section&nbsp;6.8) in those
instances (unless otherwise determined by the Board) in which (A)&nbsp;the holders of the Common Stock immediately prior to a Consummated Transaction or Control Purchase (as defined in the Plan) own
more than 50% of the voting common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after such Consummated Transaction or Control Purchase, (B)&nbsp;the holders of all classes of common stock of the
Company immediately prior to a Consummated Transaction or Control Purchase own more than 50% of the total equity of the surviving corporation immediately after such Consummated Transaction or Control
Purchase, (C)&nbsp;the Consummated Transaction or Control Purchase does not result in a Board Change and (D)&nbsp;the Consummated Transaction or Control Purchase does not result in a substantial

SIZE=2><I>Failure to Enforce Not a Waiver</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any provision of this Restricted Stock
Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Amendments</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. This Restricted Stock Agreement may be amended or modified at any time only by an instrument in writing signed
by each of the parties hereto, and approved by the Committee. The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time; provided, however, that the termination or any modification or amendment of the
Plan shall not, without the consent of the Recipient, affect the rights of the Recipient under this Restricted Stock Agreement. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Survival of Terms</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. This Restricted Stock Agreement shall apply to and bind the Recipient and the Company and their

SIZE=2><I>Agreement Not a Contract for Services; Rights to Terminate Employment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Neither the grant of the Restricted Stock, this
Restricted Stock Agreement nor any other action taken pursuant to this Restricted Stock Agreement shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the
Recipient has a right to continue to provide services as an officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company and/or the Employer for any period of time or at any specific rate of compensation.
Nothing in the Plan or in this Restricted Stock Agreement shall confer upon the Recipient the right to continue in the employment of an Employer or affect any right which an Employer may have to
terminate the employment of the Recipient. The Recipient specifically acknowledges that the Employer intends to review the Recipient's performance from time to time, and that the Company and/or the
Employer has the right to terminate the Recipient's employment at any time, including a time in close proximity to the Vesting Date, for any reason, with or without cause. The Recipient acknowledges
that upon his or her termination of employment with an Employer for any reason, then all shares of Restricted Stock not yet vested shall be immediately forfeited at such time, and the Company shall
return to the Recipient an amount equal to the par value of the Restricted Stock which was paid by the Recipient to the Company as is set forth in Section&nbsp;3 of this Restricted Stock Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Decisions of Board or Committee</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Board or the Committee shall have the right to resolve all questions which may arise
in connection with the Restricted Stock. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Board or the Committee regarding the Restricted Stock, the Plan or this Restricted Stock
Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. </FONT></P>

Recipient returning a counter-signed copy of this Restricted Stock Agreement to the designated representative of the Company on or before 60&nbsp;days after the date of its distribution to the
Recipient. In the event that the Recipient fails to so return a counter-signed copy of this Agreement within such 60-day period, then this Restricted Stock Agreement and the Restricted
Stock granted hereunder shall automatically become null and void and shall have no further force or effect. </FONT></P>
