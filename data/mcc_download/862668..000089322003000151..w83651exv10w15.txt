                                   BACKGROUND

     The Payor executed the above-referenced amended and restated term / time

agreements including a certain Letter Agreement dated November 16, 2001 (as

     The Payor and the Lender are executing an amendment to Loan Agreements,
dated of even date herewith, (the "2003 Amendment" and together with the
Existing Loan Agreements, the "Loan Agreements") pursuant to which the parties
have agreed to amend certain terms and conditions.

          1. Article 8. of the Term Note is hereby amended as follows:

               8. RIGHT OF SETOFF. In the Event of Default, in addition to all
               liens upon and rights of setoff against the money, securities or
               other property of the Borrower given to the Bank by law, the Bank
               shall have, with respect to the Borrower's obligations to the
               Bank under this Note and to the extent permitted by law, a
               contractual possessory security interest in and a contractual
               right of setoff against, and the Borrower hereby assigns,
               conveys, delivers, pledges and transfers to the Bank all of the
               Borrower's right, title and interest in and to, all deposits,
               moneys, securities and other property of the Borrower now or
               hereafter in the possession of or on deposit with, or in transit
               to, the Bank whether held in a general or special account or
               deposit, whether held jointly with someone else, or whether held
               for safekeeping or otherwise, excluding, however, all IRA, Keogh,
               and trust accounts. Every such security interest and right of
               setoff may be exercised without demand upon or notice to the
               Borrower. Every such right of setoff shall be deemed to have been
               exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
               hereunder without any action of the Bank, although the Bank may
               enter such setoff on its books and records at a later time.

          2.   Exhibit A of the Term Note is hereby amended and restated to read
               in its entirety as follows:
