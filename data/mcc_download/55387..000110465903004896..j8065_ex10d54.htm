to the provisions of Section&nbsp;10(f) hereof, all determinations required to

by the Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up
Payment is required to be paid to the Executive and the amount of such Gross-Up
Payment, if any, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm (the

Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to submit its determination and
detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive within
thirty (30) calendar days after the Termination Date, if applicable, and any
such other time or times as may be requested by the Company or the Executive.

Executive, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid the required Gross-Up
Payment in cash to the Executive within five (5) business days after receipt of
such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment to the
Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by
the Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such determination,
furnish the Company and the Executive an opinion that the Executive has
substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal, state or
local income or other tax return. As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) at
the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible
that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have
been made (an &#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with the calculations required to be
made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its
remedies pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(f) hereof and the Executive thereafter is
required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the
Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred
and to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both
the Company and the Executive as promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment</p>

enforceable.&#160; Specifically, if any court
of competent jurisdiction should hold that any portion of the foregoing
description is overly broad as to one or more states of the United States or
one or more foreign jurisdictions, then that state or states or foreign

the restrictions of paragraph (a) of this Section applies and the restrictions
