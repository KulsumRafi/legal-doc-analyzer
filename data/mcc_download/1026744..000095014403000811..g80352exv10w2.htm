other provision (or remaining part of the affected provision) of this Note, but
this Note shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision (or part thereof) had never been contained herein, but only to the

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision of this Note and/or any instrument securing
payment of this Note to the contrary, it is the intent of the undersigned Maker
and Lender that Lender hereof shall never be entitled to receive, collect or
apply as interest on principal of the indebtedness any amount in excess of the
maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law; and in the
event Lender ever receives, collects, or applies as interest any such excess,
such amount which should be excessive interest shall be deemed a partial
prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the principal of
the indebtedness secured hereby is paid in full, any remaining excess funds
shall forthwith be paid to Maker. In determining whether or not the interest
paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the highest lawful rate,
Maker and Lender shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law
(a)&nbsp;characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather
than as interest (b)&nbsp;exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and
(c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of
interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the indebtedness so that
the interest rate is uniform throughout the entire term of the indebtedness;
provided that if the indebtedness is paid and performed in full prior to the
end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the
actual period of existence thereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, Lender
shall refund to Maker the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such
excess against the principal portion of the indebtedness, and in such event,
Lender shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for
contracting for, charging, or receiving interest in excess of the maximum
lawful rate. In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the
indebtedness collateralized hereby exceed the maximum amount permissible under
applicable law. If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any
provision hereof or any provision of any instrument securing the primary
obligation at the time performance of such provision shall be due shall involve
transcending the limit of validity prescribed by applicable law, then, <I>ipso
facto, </I>the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such
validity. This provision shall control every other provision of this Note.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maker, and each surety, endorser, guarantor and other party liable for the
payment of any sums of money payable on this Note, severally waive the right of
exemption under the Constitution and Laws of Florida, presentment and demand
for payment, protest and notice of protest and nonpayment, notice of dishonor,
notice of demand or intent to demand, notice of maturity and all requirements
necessary to hold each of them liable as maker, surety, endorser, guarantor and
any other party liable for the payment of sums of money hereunder, and agree
that their liability on this Note shall not be affected by any renewal or
extension in the time of payment thereof or by any release or change in any
security for the payment of this Note, regardless of the number of such
renewals, extensions, releases or changes.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maker and Lender mutually understand, covenant and agree that the
provisions of this Note (i)&nbsp;shall be binding upon Maker and its successors and
assigns (except as herein otherwise set forth) and shall inure to the benefit
of Lender and its assigns including any subsequent holder of this Note and (ii)
shall be construed, governed and enforced in all respects by the laws of the
State of Florida, including the Usury Laws of said state.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time shall be of the essence of each and every covenant and promise
contained in this Note and every other instrument securing the repayment of
this Note.

Security Agreement (the &#147;Security Agreement&#148;) dated September&nbsp;23, 1999 between
Maker and Lender and is to be construed according to the Laws of Florida. Any
default occurring under the Loan Agreement (which default is not cured after
notice thereof, if required under the applicable Loan Document, and the
expiration of any applicable grace period) shall constitute a default under
this Note, and Lender, at its option, may declare this Note due and payable in
full and may exercise its remedies under the Security Agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maker hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Florida in the event any litigation arising from or related to this Note is
commenced. Maker agrees that the Lender may institute any cause of action
against Maker involving this Note in the courts of Miami-Dade County, Florida,
and hereby waives any venue privilege or right to be sued in any other forum.

IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS, OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OR ANY OF THE
LOAN DOCUMENTS. FURTHER, THE MAKER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVES OR
AGENTS OF THE LENDER NOR THE MAKER&#146;S OR THE LENDER&#146;S COUNSEL HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSED OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE LENDER WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
LITIGATION SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. MAKER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LENDER HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS TRANSACTION
BY, INTER ALIA, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. THE MAKERS AGREE NOT TO SEEK
TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY
OTHER ACTION BY WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.
