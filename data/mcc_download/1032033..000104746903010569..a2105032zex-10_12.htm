Paragraph&nbsp;4, was increased from 1,250,000 shares on account of a January&nbsp;2, 1998 stock split and decreased by 1,500,000 on November&nbsp;6, 2002) subject to any further adjustment

consolidation, combination or other similar event, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Committee to the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan, the kind of shares under Options then
outstanding, the Purchase Price, as defined in Paragraph&nbsp;7, and other relevant provisions, to the extent that the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that such change makes such
