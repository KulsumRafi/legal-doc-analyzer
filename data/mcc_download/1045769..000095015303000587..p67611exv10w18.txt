4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THIS AMENDMENT. The satisfaction of each of the
following shall constitute conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this
Amendment and each and every provision hereof:

      (a) The representations and warranties in the Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all respects on and as of the date
hereof, as though made on such date (except to the extent that such
representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date);

      (b) Agent shall have received the reaffirmation and consent of each
Guarantor, attached hereto as Exhibit A, duly executed and delivered by an

ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE

original executed counterpart of this Amendment, but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Amendment.

Agreement to "this Agreement", "hereunder", "herein", "hereof" or words of like
