management of competing assisted living facilities.

                                    AGREEMENT

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
promises and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable

in which such Person has a twenty-five percent (25%) or more beneficial interest

owns, directly or indirectly, at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the
ownership interest in such Person or otherwise has the power to direct the
management, operations or business of such Person. The term "BENEFICIAL OWNER"

<PAGE>

                1.2 OTHER DEFINITIONS. All initially capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Management Agreements. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references
herein to "years" or "months" shall mean "calendar years" or "calendar months."

        2. ADDITIONAL TERMINATION RIGHT.

                2.1. Return Hurdle. In addition to, and without limitation of,
any rights or remedies of SSALH under any Management Agreement, SSALH shall have
the right to terminate all (but not less than all) of the Management Agreements
by written notice given to Manager, if USALF's share of Distributable Cash Flow
from all Facilities is less than nine and five-tenths percent (9.5%) of USALF's
Invested Equity (the "RETURN HURDLE") for each of two (2) consecutive calendar
years, except in the event of a Force Majeure Event or Major Renovation Project.
Manager may, on not more than two (2) separate occasions during any period of
ten (10) consecutive calendar years, elect to pay to USALF the amount which
would be necessary to ensure that USALF's share of Distributable Cash Flow meets
the Return Hurdle for the applicable calendar years (the "CURE RIGHT"), in which
case (i) the Facilities will be deemed to have met the Return Hurdle for the
calendar years in question, and (ii) SSALH shall not have the right to terminate
the Management Agreements based on missing the Return Hurdle for those two
calendar years. If Manager elects to exercise the Cure Right, Manager must pay
the necessary amount to USALF within thirty (30) business days following USALF's
notice to Manager that USALF has elected to cause SSALH to terminate the
Management Agreements as a result of Manager's failure to meet the Return Hurdle
for each of two (2) consecutive calendar years. If Manager makes the necessary
payment by the required date, SSALH's exercise of its termination right will be
null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cure Right shall not be
applicable in the event that USALF's share of Distributed Cash Flow from all
Facilities is less than eight percent (8%) of USALF's Invested Equity for each
of two (2) consecutive calendar years, except in the event of a Force Majeure
Event or Major Renovation Project. Calendar years separated by a calendar year
in which a Force Majeure Event or Major Renovation Project occurs shall be
deemed to be consecutive calendar years. Manager acknowledges and agrees that
USALF shall have the right, acting alone, to exercise all of the rights of SSALH
under this Agreement including, without limitation, the termination rights set
forth in this Section 2.1.

                2.2 Defaulting or Disabling Events. If there has been a
Defaulting Event or Disabling Event by Managing Member under the Operating
Agreement, and if as a result thereof USALF exercises its rights under the
Buy-Sell provisions of the Operating Agreement, then after the closing of the
acquisition by USALF of Managing Member's interest in SSALH, SSALH shall have
the right to terminate the Management Agreements on not less than sixty (60)
days' prior written notice. In such event, no Termination Fee will be payable
under the Management Agreements.

                2.3 Effective Date of Termination. Any termination of the
Management Agreements under Section 2 hereof shall be effective as of the
Termination Date set forth in the applicable notice of termination, which shall
not be less than sixty (60) days, nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days,
from the date of such notice.

        3. POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT TO MANAGEMENT FEES FOR CERTAIN FACILITIES.
Manager agrees that the Percentage Fee portion of the Management Fee is subject
to recomputation as set forth in this Section 3 for the Arlington Facility, the
Edina Facility, the Fair Oaks Facility and the Palos Park Facility. Promptly
after December 31, 2003, Manager shall determine the annualized "Net Operating
Income" (defined below) for each such Facility based on the Net Operating Income
for such Facility for the three (3) month period ending on such date. Commencing
as of January 1, 2004, the Percentage Fee portion of the Management Fee for each
such Facility shall be increased or decreased by the adjustment amount as set
forth on Exhibit C-1, C-2, C-3 or C-4, as applicable (the "Adjustment Amount"),
correlating to the annualized Net Operating Income of such Facility shown on
Exhibit C-1, C-2, C-3 or C-4, as applicable. Such adjusted Percentage Fee
portion of the Management Fee shall remain in effect for such Facility until the
earliest of (i) the sale of such Facility to a third party, (ii) the acquisition
by one member of SSALH of the other member's interests pursuant to the Buy-Sell
provisions of the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of SSALH (the
"Venture Agreement"), or (iii) December 31, 2009. For purposes of this Section
3, "Net Operating Income" of a Facility shall mean Gross Revenues attributable
to such Facility, less all Facility Expenses of such Facility, including the
Management Fee.

        4. NON-COMPETE.

        (a) Generally. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the
Management Agreements to the contrary, Sunrise shall not (i) develop a senior
housing or assisted living facility within any Non-Compete Area, (ii) own any
interest in a senior housing or assisted living facility within any Non-Compete
Area, except that this non-compete provision will not restrict Sunrise from
acquiring a multi-property portfolio that includes a senior housing or assisted
living facility within any Non-Compete Area, provided that at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the overall value of the portfolio is comprised of properties
outside such Non-Compete Area and (iii) manage any senior housing or any
assisted living facility within any Non-Compete Area unless the direct and
indirect ownership interest of Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc., and its wholly
owned subsidiaries ("SALI") in such assisted living facility is in the aggregate
no greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total ownership interests in such
senior housing or assisted living facility. By way of example and not in
limitation, if a Person in which SALI owned a fifty percent (50%) interest owned
thirty percent (30%) of an assisted living facility, SALI would for purposes
hereof be deemed to own fifteen (15%) of such facility, and Sunrise would not be
prohibited from managing the same. If Sunrise is permitted, by virtue of this
provision, to manage a facility within the Non-Compete Area, the facility so
managed will not be advertised as being a "Sunrise" facility in the same manner
as the Facilities leased and operated by SSALH. Such other facilities will be
held out under a different primary name, as managed by Sunrise. The limitations
contained in this Section 3 shall survive the termination or expiration of any
individual Management Agreement and shall only cease to be in force and effect
after the last Management Agreement has expired or been terminated.

        (b) New Orleans. SSALH leases a Facility known as Sunrise of Bayou St.
John in New Orleans, Louisiana. Sunrise has disclosed to SSALH that it owns a
potential development site located at 1200 Mirabeau Avenue, Nun, Louisiana 70122
(the "Nun Site"). SSALH hereby agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or in the Venture Agreement to the contrary, Sunrise may develop the
Nun Site provided that the following conditions have been


                                       4
<PAGE>

met: (i) the Facility known as Sunrise of Bayou St. John has had an occupancy
rate of at least ninety-five percent (95%) for the twelve (12) month period
immediately prior to the commencement of construction of the Facility on the Nun
Site; and (ii) Sunrise shall provide to SSALH a right of first offer to acquire
the Nun Site prior to Sunrise offering any third party the right to acquire an
interest in the Nun Site; and (iii) if SSALH has not exercised its right of
first offer pursuant to the foregoing clause prior to development of the site,
then Sunrise shall again provide SSALH a second right of first offer to acquire
the facility constructed on the Nun Site at such time as the occupancy at the
facility has become stabilized; and (iv) Sunrise shall not operate the facility
developed on the Nun Site (unless SSALH has acquired an interest in the facility
pursuant to the foregoing right of first offer) in a manner which requires
Sunrise to obtain either an Assisted Living License or an Alzheimer's Care
License for the operation of the facility. If the Sunrise of Bayou St. John
Facility has less than a ninety-five percent (95%) occupancy, then Sunrise may
proceed with such development provided that Sunrise substitutes a different
asset acceptable to USALF (the "Substitute Asset") for the Sunrise of Bayou St.
John Facility into SSALH, and purchases the Sunrise of Bayou St. John Facility
from SSALH at a price acceptable to USALF. For purposes hereof, the right of
first offer shall be provided in the same manner as set forth in Section 22 of
the Venture Agreement, except that SSALH shall be substituted in the place of
Managing Member and Sunrise shall be substituted in the place of Investor
Member. FMV shall be established as set forth in Section 22.4 of the Venture
Agreement.

                7.6 BINDING ON SUCCESSORS.

                (a) The rights and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind their respective heirs,
successors and assigns.

                (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the termination right
set forth in Section 2 is based upon the Invested Equity of USALF in SSALH, such
right can be exercised by SSALH only while SSALH (or its wholly-owned
subsidiaries) is the lessee of the Facilities and


                                       9
<PAGE>

cannot be exercised by any successor or assign of SSALH. In the event that SSALH
sells or assigns its interests as the lessee of any Facility, Manager agrees to
enter into an amendment to its Management Agreement for such Facility that will
grant the successor owner/lessee and operator (a "Successor") the right to
terminate the Management Agreement. Such termination right shall be based upon
the same general concept set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the
Manager agrees that it will negotiate in good faith hurdles that will facilitate
the sale of such Facility at a price favorable to SSALH, provided, that the
Manager will not be obligated to agree to a Return Hurdle that is more favorable
to the buyer than 200 basis points lower than the deemed capitalization rate for
the particular Facility or a lower Return Hurdle for which no cure is allowed
that is more favorable to the buyer than 350 basis points lower than such deemed
capitalization rate. The deemed capitalization rate shall be determined by
dividing (i) 200% of the net operating income for the six (6) months immediately
preceding the sale of the Facility by (ii) the purchase price for the Facility
paid by the Successor. This right to terminate by a Successor shall be on a
pooled basis for all Facilities purchased by such Successor. Manager shall not
be required to provide such termination right to a Successor which acquires only
a single Facility.

                7.7 CONFIDENTIALITY. Both parties hereto agree to maintain the
confidentiality of the financial terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
maintain the confidentiality of (a) any financial information provided by one
party to the other, and (b) all information contained in any plans,
specifications, manuals, forms, contracts, books, records, computer discs and
similar materials containing information, invoices and other documents received
or maintained by SSALH pursuant to this Agreement, other than information that
is available from public sources. Either party may, however, disclose any of
such information to its agents, directors, officers, employees, advisors,
attorneys, affiliates or representatives who require such information for the
purpose of performing or assisting in the performance of its obligations or
services hereunder, and to investors or lenders or proposed investors or
lenders, provided that in all such cases such parties shall be informed of the
confidential nature of such information. Either party hereto may also disclose
any such information (x) to the extent required by law, regulation (including
SEC regulations) or court order provided that such party shall have first, to
the extent reasonably practicable, advised the other of the requirement to
disclose such information and shall have afforded the other an opportunity to
dispute such requirement and seek relief therefrom by legal process; (y) in
connection with any suit, action, arbitration or other proceedings between the
parties hereto or their respective Related Parties, or (z) to the extent
required in connection with the preparation or filing of any tax returns or
other filings required by any applicable law. Any press releases or other public
announcements concerning SSALH or the arrangement between the parties shall be
mutually approved by both parties in their reasonable discretion.

                7.8 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect
to all time or notice deadlines set forth herein; provided, however, this
provision shall not affect the rights of any defaulting party hereunder to cure
such default within the time periods (if any) explicitly set forth herein, if
and as so permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
