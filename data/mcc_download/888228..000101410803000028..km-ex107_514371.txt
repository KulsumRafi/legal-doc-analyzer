      THIS MODIFICATION OF CREDIT AGREEMENT COMMITMENT (this  "Modification") is
made and  entered  into  effective  as of the 12th day of  December,  2002  (the

Delaware limited liability  company (the "Company"),  CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON
("CSFB"),  and WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,  as administrative agent (in

the right, with the consent of the  Administrative  Agent, to increase the total
Commitments  of the  Lenders  by  adding  to the  Credit  Agreement  one or more
additional  Lenders  or  by  allowing  one  or  more  Lenders  to  increase  its
Commitment; provided (1) no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, (2) no
such  increase  shall  cause (a) the  aggregate  Commitments  under  the  Credit
Agreement to exceed  $600,000,000  or (b) the sum of the  aggregate  Commitments
under the Credit  Agreement  plus the  aggregate  commitments  under the Related
Credit Agreement to exceed $1,100,000,000,  and (3) no Lender's Commitment shall
be increased without such Lender's consent.

      C.  Wachovia has agreed with the Company to increase its  Commitment  from

increase.
