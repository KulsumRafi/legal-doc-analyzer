<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of January&nbsp;1, 2003, by and between Alliance Imaging,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,

the extension of such term as hereinafter provided and subject to earlier termination as provided in Paragraph&nbsp;8. The expiration of the term of this Agreement shall be extended automatically by
an additional three months as of the last day of each quarterly period following the Effective Time unless either party desires to modify or terminate this Agreement and notifies the other party of
its desire to modify or terminate this Agreement at least 30&nbsp;days prior to any such quarterly renewal date. The period of employment as provided in this Paragraph&nbsp;1(b) is sometimes

California, or such other locations agreed upon by the parties. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, Executive may be required to travel in the conduct of the Corporation's business and to discharge his

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
view of the fact that Executive's work as an executive of the Corporation will bring Executive into close contact with many confidential affairs of the Corporation, including matters
of a business nature, such as information about customers (including pricing information), costs, profits, markets, sales, strategic plans for future development and any other information not readily
available to the public, Executive hereby agrees: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;To
keep secret all confidential matters of the Corporation (including without limitation such matters which the Corporation notifies Executive are confidential) learned
prior to the date of this Agreement and in the course of Executive's employment hereunder, and not to disclose them to anyone outside of the Corporation, either during or after Executive's employment
with the Corporation, or both, until such time as the Corporation gives its written consent to such disclosure; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;To
deliver promptly to the Corporation on termination of Executive's employment by the Corporation or at any other time the Corporation may so request, all memoranda,
notes, records, reports and other documents (and all copies thereof) relating to the Corporation's business which Executive may then possess or have under Executive's control; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;That
violation of this Paragraph&nbsp;7 would cause the Corporation irreparable damage for which the Corporation cannot be reasonably compensated in damages in an
action at law, and therefore in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Executive of this Paragraph&nbsp;7, the Corporation shall be entitled to make application to a court of competent
jurisdiction for equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise (without being required to post a bond). This provision shall not, however, be construed as a waiver of any of the rights which the
Corporation may have for damages under this
Agreement or otherwise, and all of the Corporation's rights and remedies shall be unrestricted and cumulative. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;For

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Certain capitalized terms used in this Paragraph&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;9 and Paragraph&nbsp;10 hereof are defined in Paragraph&nbsp;8(d), below. </FONT></P>

or Disability. Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraph&nbsp;9 with respect to certain post-Date of Termination payment obligations of
the Corporation, this Agreement shall terminate immediately as of the Date of Termination in the event of the Executive's death or in the event that the Executive becomes disabled. The Executive will
be deemed to be disabled upon the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the end of a six (6)&nbsp;consecutive month period during which, by reason of physical or mental injury or disease, the Executive has been
unable to perform substantially all of his usual and customary duties under this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;the date that a reputable physician selected by the Board, and as to whom the Executive has no

of the Executive's usual and customary duties under this Agreement for a period of at least six (6)&nbsp;consecutive months. If any question arises as to whether the Executive is disabled, upon
reasonable request therefor by the Board, the Executive shall submit to reasonable medical examination for the purpose of determining the existence, nature and extent of any such disability. In
accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;14, the Board shall promptly give the Executive written notice of any such determination of the Executive's disability and of any decision of the Board to terminate
the Executive's employment by reason thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge
for Cause. In accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth, the Board may discharge the Executive from his employment hereunder for Cause. Except to
the extent otherwise
provided in Paragraph&nbsp;9 with respect to certain post-Date of Termination obligations of the Corporation, this Agreement shall terminate immediately as of the Date of Termination in
the event the Executive is discharged for Cause. Any discharge of the Executive for Cause shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination to the Executive given in accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;14
of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i)&nbsp;indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and
(ii)&nbsp;if the Date of Termination is to be other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall in all events be within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after
the giving of such notice). In the case of a discharge of the Executive for Cause, the Notice of Termination shall include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board at a meeting called and held
for such purpose authorizing such action. No purported termination of the Executive's employment for Cause shall be effective without a Notice of Termination. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination
for Other Reasons. The Corporation may discharge the Executive without Cause by giving written notice to the Executive in accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;14
at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the Date of Termination. The Executive may resign from his employment by giving written notice to the Corporation in accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;14 at
least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the Date of Termination. Except to the extent otherwise provided in Paragraph&nbsp;9 with respect to certain post-Date of Termination obligations
of the Corporation, this Agreement shall terminate immediately as of the Date of Termination in the event the Executive is discharged without Cause or resigns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 ("DEFRA") relating to "excess parachute
payments" shall be applicable to any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with a termination of the Executive's employment with the Corporation, then the total
amount of payments or benefits payable to Executive which are deemed to constitute parachute payments shall be reduced to the largest amount such that provisions of DEFRA relating to "excess parachute
payment" shall no longer be applicable. Should such a reduction be required, the Executive shall determine, in the exercise of his sole discretion, which payment or benefit to reduce, extend or
eliminate. Pending such determination, the Corporation shall continue to make all other required payments to Executive at the time and in the manner provided herein and shall pay the largest portion
of any parachute payments such that the provisions of DEFRA relating to "excess parachute payments" shall no longer be applicable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Recharacterization
of Payments. Due to the complexity in the application of Section&nbsp;280(G) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") it is
possible that payments made or benefits received hereunder should not have been made under Paragraph&nbsp;10(a) (an "Overpayment"). In the event that it is determined in writing by the Corporation's
outside auditors in their reasonable good faith judgment or by any court of competent jurisdiction that an Overpayment has been made resulting in an "Excess Parachute Payment" as defined in
Section&nbsp;280G(b)(1) of the Code, then any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as an unsecured, long-term loan from the Corporation to the Executive, his personal
representative, his successors or assigns, as the case may be, that is payable, together with accrued interest from the date of the making of the Overpayment at the rate of 8% per annum on the later
to occur of the third anniversary of the payment of such Overpayment, or 6&nbsp;months following the date upon which it is determined an Overpayment was made. Should it be determined that such an
Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall determine, in the exercise of his sole discretion, which payments or benefits shall be deemed to constitute the Overpayment. </FONT></P>
