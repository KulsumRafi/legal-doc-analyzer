<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of the 15th day of July, 2002 (the "Effective Date"), between IHOP CORP., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and Gregg Nettleton (the "Employee"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas,
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has approved and authorized the entry into this Agreement with the Employee; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,
Therefore, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company and the Employee hereby agree
as follows: </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee is employed as Chief Marketing Officer of the Company from the Effective Date
through the Term of this Agreement (as defined in Section&nbsp;2 hereof). In this capacity, the Employee shall have such duties and responsibilities as may be designated to him by the Board from
time to time and as are not inconsistent with the Employee's position with the Company, including the performance of duties with respect to any subsidiaries of the Company, as may be designated by the
Board. During the Employee's period of employment hereunder, the Employee shall be based in the principal offices of the Company in Southern California, and shall not be required to relocate outside
of Southern California to perform services hereunder, except for travel as reasonably required in the performance of his duties hereunder. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "initial term" of this Agreement shall be for the period commencing on the Effective Date and
ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that on the second
anniversary of the Effective Date, and on each subsequent anniversary date thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless, not later than 90 days
prior to such applicable anniversary date, the Company or the Employee shall give notice not to extend this Agreement; and provided further, however, that, if a Change in Control (as defined in
Section&nbsp;11(g)) occurs prior to the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not expire prior to the last day of the 24th month
following the date of such Change in Control. The "Term of this Agreement" or "Term" shall mean, for purposes of this Agreement, both the "initial term" (as hereinbefore described) and any additional
term (created by extension, as described above), and the Term of this Agreement shall not be affected by the Employee's termination of employment. </FONT></P>

expectations as assessed by the Chief Executive Officer. Further, such salary shall be increased at such times, if any, and in such amounts as determined by the Board, which increases shall be
consistent with the historical business practices of the Company and the salary adjustments for other senior executives of the Company. Such salary shall be payable by the Company to the Employee not
less frequently than monthly and shall not be decreased at any time during the Term of this Agreement. Participation in deferred compensation, discretionary bonus, retirement, and other employee
benefit plans and in fringe benefits shall not reduce the salary payable to the Employee under this Section. </FONT></P>
