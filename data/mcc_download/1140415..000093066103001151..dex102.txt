Contracts.

               (e) At the Closing, the transfer of the Gasboy/MSI Intangible
Property shall be effected pursuant to customary instruments of assignment or

<PAGE>

Buyer, and any other assignments or instruments with respect to any such
Intangible Property for which an assignment or instrument is required to assign,
transfer and convey such Gasboy/MSI Intangible Property (collectively, the
"Gasboy/MSI Intangible Property Instruments").

        Section 1.6      Consideration. The consideration for the Acquired
Assets shall be(a) forty two million dollars ($42,000,000), as may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.6 (the "Cash Consideration"), and (b) the assumption of
the Assumed Liabilities. The payment of the Cash Consideration and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities are referred to herein as the
"Consideration". The Cash Consideration shall be deemed allocated as follows:
(x) 71.43% shall be allocated for the purchase of the Gasboy Assets, and (y)
28.57% shall be allocated for the purchase of the Tokheim Assets. The Assumed
Liabilities shall be allocated to the portion of the Acquired Business to which
they most closely relate. The Cash Consideration shall be payable at the Closing
as follows:

               (a) Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
less the total amount of the Deposit and all interest accrued thereon, to
Sellers by wire transfer to such bank account(s) designated in writing by Parent
on behalf of Sellers.

               (b) Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Holder shall continue to hold the Deposit (including interest accrued thereon),
which shall be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section
2.7.

        Section 1.7      Deposit. In connection with the mutual execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the date of such mutual execution and delivery is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Execution Date"), Buyer shall promptly, but
in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Execution Date, deposit into
escrow (the "Escrow") with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Escrow
Holder") 3.5% of the Cash Consideration (the "Deposit") in immediately
available, good funds, to be held and disbursed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, dated on or about the Execution Date, among the Sellers, Buyer and
the Escrow Holder (the "Escrow Agreement"). Such Escrow Agreement shall include
the provisions set forth in this Section 1.7, including any provisions
incorporated by reference herein. Upon receipt of the Deposit, the Escrow Holder
shall immediately deposit the Deposit into an interest-bearing account. The
Deposit shall only become nonrefundable upon the earlier of (x) the Closing Date
or (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (a "Buyer
Default Termination"). In the event the Deposit becomes non-refundable by reason
of a Buyer Default Termination, the provisions of Section 1.8 below shall apply.
At the Closing, all of the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) shall be
credited toward payment of the Cash Consideration. If this Agreement is
terminated for any reason other than a Buyer Default Termination, the Escrow
Holder shall return to Buyer the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) upon
receipt of notice by Buyer to the Escrow Holder. The Escrow Holder's escrow fees
and charges shall be paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer.

        Section 1.8      Liquidated Damages. Buyer and Sellers hereby agree that
it is impossible to determine accurately the amount of damages that Sellers
would suffer if the Contemplated Transactions were not consummated as a result
of a Buyer Default Termination. As a result, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby agree that (a) in the event of a
Buyer Default Termination, Buyer shall be obligated to pay liquidated damages in
the amount of the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) and (b) such
liquidated damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers against
Buyer by reason of such breach and such termination. Accordingly, if liquidated
damages are payable hereunder, the Escrow Holder shall disburse the Deposit (and
any interest accrued thereon) to Parent, on behalf of all Sellers, to be
retained by Parent for its own account.

to Sellers, rent, current property and other ad valorem Taxes, prepaid
advertising and other items of expense (including, without limitation, any
prepaid insurance under the Assumed Contracts) and income relating to or
attributable to the Assumed Contracts during the month of Closing shall be
prorated between Sellers and Buyer as of the Closing Date. Rent relating to or
attributable to the Assumed Contracts shall be prorated on the basis of a thirty
(30) day month.

        Section 2.5      Tax Allocation. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Sellers
shall agree on an allocation of the Consideration (with respect to that portion
of the Consideration consisting of the Assumed Liabilities, only such Assumed
Liabilities that are liabilities for federal income Tax purposes) among the
Acquired Assets which allocation shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the rules and regulations thereunder and with the allocation provided
in Section 1.6. Buyer and Sellers agree that such allocations shall be adjusted
to reflect appropriately any adjustment to the purchase price hereunder. Except
as required by Applicable Law, Buyer and Sellers agree to use such allocation,
as so adjusted, in filing all required forms under Section 1060 of the Code, and
all other Tax Returns. Buyer and Sellers further agree that the payment of the
Consideration to Sellers contemplated by Section 2.3 may be made to a single
Seller that is designated by Parent in writing as being authorized to act as
agent for all Sellers, whereupon each Seller shall be deemed to have received
the Consideration allocable to the Acquired Assets owned by such Seller in
accordance with the allocation determination under this Section 2.5.

        Section 2.6      Pre-Closing Adjustment to Cash Consideration.

               (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a

                                        9

<PAGE>

sheet of the Acquired Business as of December 31, 2002 (the "Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet") and a related statement of Current Assets for the Acquired Business as
of December 31, 2002 (the "Pre-Closing Current Assets Statement"). The
Pre-Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
Monthly Financial Reports. The Current Assets as reflected on the Pre-Closing
Current Assets Statement shall be calculated by Sellers in good faith and in
their sole discretion, on a basis consistent with Schedule 2.6(a). In addition,
the Pre-Closing Current Assets Statement shall set forth separately the Current
Assets included within the Gasboy Assets (the "Gasboy Current Assets") and the
Current Assets included within the Tokheim Assets (the "Tokheim Current
Assets"), in each case as of December 31, 2002.

               (b) To the extent that the Gasboy Current Assets shown on the
Pre-Closing Current Assets Statement (the "Pre-Closing Gasboy Current Assets")
are less than eight million one hundred thousand dollars ($8,100,000) (the
"Baseline Gasboy Current Assets"), the Cash Consideration payable at Closing by
Buyer shall be reduced by the amount of the difference. To the extent that the
Pre-Closing Gasboy Current Assets are higher than the Baseline Gasboy Current
Assets, the Cash Consideration payable at Closing by Buyer shall be increased by
the amount of the surplus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall any adjustment to the Cash Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) exceed eight million one hundred thousand
dollars ($8,100,000).

               (c) To the extent that the Tokheim Current Assets shown on the
Pre-Closing Current Assets Statement (the "Pre-Closing Tokheim Current Assets")
are less than thirty four million nine hundred thousand dollars ($34,900,000)
(the "Baseline Tokheim Current Assets"), the Cash Consideration payable at
Closing by Buyer shall be reduced by the amount of the difference. To the extent
that the Pre-Closing Tokheim Current Assets are higher than the Baseline Tokheim
Current Assets, the Cash Consideration payable at Closing by Buyer shall be
increased by the amount of the surplus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall any adjustment to the Cash
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) exceed six million nine hundred
ninety nine thousand four hundred dollars ($6,999,400).

        Section 2.7      Post-Closing Adjustment to Cash Consideration.

               (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five
(45) days following the end of the month in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer
shall deliver to Sellers a combined balance sheet of the Acquired Business as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a related statement of
Current Assets for the Acquired Business (the "Current Assets Statement") as of
the Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with Parent's audited balance sheet for its fiscal year 2001 and in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, subject to the absence of footnotes
and such changes as may be required by Schedule 2.6(a). The Current Assets as
reflected on the Current Assets Statement shall be calculated on a basis
consistent with Schedule 2.6(a). In addition, the Current Assets Statement shall
set forth separately the Gasboy Current Assets and the Tokheim Current Assets,
in each case as of the Closing Date.

               (b) During the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
period of any dispute within the contemplation of this Section 2.7, Buyer shall,
with respect to the Acquired Business, (i) provide Sellers and Sellers'
authorized representatives upon reasonable advance notice with access during
normal business hours to the books, records, facilities, employees and
accountants of Buyer and, subject to the execution of any required releases, the
work papers used in the preparation of the Current Assets Statement, and (ii)
cooperate with Sellers and Sellers' authorized representatives, including the
provision on a timely basis of all information necessary or useful in connection
with Sellers' review of the Closing Balance Sheet and Current Assets Statement.

                                       10

<PAGE>

               (c) Buyer shall deliver a copy of the Current Assets Statement
and the Closing Balance Sheet to Sellers promptly after they have been prepared
and in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the month in
which the Closing Date occurs. Unless Buyer delivers the Current Assets
Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th)
day after the end of the month in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer and
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to use (i) the Pre-Closing
Gasboy Current Assets as the Gasboy Current Assets on the Adjusted Current
Assets Statement and (ii) the Pre-Closing Tokheim Current Assets as the Tokheim
Current Assets on the Adjusted Current Assets Statement, in each case for all
purposes hereunder. After receipt of the Current Assets Statement and the
Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers shall have thirty (30) days to review the Current
Assets Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet. Unless Sellers deliver written
notice to Buyer on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after Sellers' receipt
of the Current Assets Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet specifying all
disputed items and the basis therefor, Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed to the Current Assets Statement. If Sellers so notify Buyer of their
objection to the Current Assets Statement, Sellers and Buyer shall, within
thirty (30) days following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to
resolve their differences and any resolution by them shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

               (d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Sellers and
Buyer have not resolved their differences with respect to the Current Assets
Statement, then Sellers and Buyer shall submit their dispute to Deloitte &
Touche LLP, or, if Deloitte & Touche LLP is unavailable or unwilling to be so
engaged, another accounting firm of national reputation agreed to by Buyer and
Sellers (the "Neutral Auditor"). Each party agrees to execute, if requested by
the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne equally by Sellers and Buyer. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in
limitation thereof, Buyer shall only be liable for fifty percent (50%) of the
fees and expenses, if any, of the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor shall act
as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by Sellers and
Buyer, and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute. The
Neutral Auditor's determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of their
selection, shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.7, and
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Sellers and Buyer and
shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term "Adjusted Current Assets
Statement," as hereinafter used, shall mean the definitive Current Assets
Statement agreed to by Buyer and Sellers in accordance with Section 2.7(c) or
the definitive Current Assets Statement resulting from the determinations made
by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this Section 2.7(d). The Current
Assets reflected on the Adjusted Current Assets Statement shall not be more than
that specified by Sellers in the notice to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.7(c)
above nor less than that specified by Buyer on the Current Assets Statement.

               (e) To the extent that the Pre-Closing Gasboy Current Assets are
higher than the Gasboy Current Assets shown on the Adjusted Current Assets
Statement, Sellers shall make a cash payment to Buyer equivalent to the amount
of the difference by causing the Escrow Holder to deliver to Buyer an amount, in
cash, from the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) equivalent to such
difference; provided that if the difference is greater than the amount of the
Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon), then Sellers shall first cause the
Escrow Holder to deliver to Buyer the entire Deposit (and any interest accrued
thereon) and shall then make a cash payment to Buyer of any amounts still owing
to Buyer with respect to such difference. To the extent that the Pre-Closing
Gasboy Current Assets are less than the Gasboy Current Assets shown on the
Adjusted Current Assets Statement, Buyer shall make a cash payment to Parent on
behalf of Sellers equivalent to the amount of the surplus. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the net
adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.7(e) and Section 2.6(b) (taking into
account adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.7(e) and Section 2.6(b))
exceed eight million one hundred thousand dollars ($8,100,000) in the aggregate.

                                       11

<PAGE>

               (f) To the extent that the Pre-Closing Tokheim Current Assets are
higher than the Tokheim Current Assets shown on the Adjusted Current Assets
Statement, Sellers shall make a cash payment to Buyer equivalent to the amount
of the difference by causing the Escrow Holder to deliver to Buyer an amount, in
cash, from the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) equivalent to such
difference; provided that if the difference is greater than the amount of the
Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon), then Sellers shall first cause the
Escrow Holder to deliver to Buyer the entire Deposit (and any interest accrued
thereon) and shall then make a cash payment to Buyer of any amounts still owing
to Buyer with respect to such difference. To the extent that the Pre-Closing
Tokheim Current Assets are less than the Tokheim Current Assets shown on the
Adjusted Current Assets Statement, Buyer shall make a cash payment to Parent on
behalf of Sellers in an amount equivalent to the amount of the surplus.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the net adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.7(f) and Section
2.6(c) (taking into account adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.7(f) and
Section 2.6(c)) exceed six million nine hundred ninety nine thousand four
hundred dollars ($6,999,400) in the aggregate.

               (g) Any payment resulting from this Section 2.7 shall be referred
to as the "Post Closing Adjustment." For purposes of Sections 2.6 and 2.7,
"Current Assets" shall mean an amount equal to the aggregate book value of the
current assets of the Acquired Business reflected on a balance sheet prepared at
a given date; provided, however, that the calculation of Current Assets shall at
all times be consistent with Schedule 2.6(a), including a deduction for amounts
related to deferred sales Contracts that are Assumed Liabilities. With respect
to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, no change in accounting
principles shall be made from those utilized in preparing Parent's audited
balance sheet for its fiscal year 2001, including, without limitation, with
respect to the nature of accounts, or the determination of the level of reserves
or level of accruals, except as required by Schedule 2.6(a). For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "change in accounting principles" includes all changes in
accounting principles, policies, practices, procedures or methodologies with
respect to financial statements, their classification or their display, as well
as all changes in practices, methods, conventions or assumptions (unless
required by objective material changes in underlying events) utilized in making
accounting estimates.

               (h) Any Post Closing Adjustment will take place within ten (10)
days from the date of issuance or determination of the Adjusted Current Assets
Statement. If a Post Closing Adjustment is to be paid to Buyer, upon Buyer's
receipt of such Post Closing Adjustment, the Escrow Holder shall immediately be
instructed to disburse all remaining amounts of the Deposit (and any interest
accrued with respect to such remaining amounts) to Sellers. If a Post Closing
Adjustment is to be paid to Parent on behalf of Sellers or if no Post Closing
Adjustment is to be paid to either Buyer or Sellers, the Escrow Holder shall
immediately be instructed to deliver the Deposit (and all interest accrued
thereon) to Sellers.

                                   ARTICLE III

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

        Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, no Seller makes any representations or warranties whatsoever,
express or implied, with respect to any matter relating to the Acquired Assets.
Buyer will not have recourse to any Seller, except in the case of fraud, or to
any of the officers, directors, agents, representatives, creditors or
shareholders of any Seller, in the event any of the representations and
warranties made herein or deemed made are inaccurate in any respect as at any
time of expression thereof.

        Sellers jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer as follows:

        Section 3.1      Organization. Each Seller is a legal entity validly
existing under the

                                       12

<PAGE>

laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own or lease and to operate all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted
and as presently proposed to be conducted by Sellers, except where the failure
to be so validly existing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the character
or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would
not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 3.2      Sufficiency of Assets. Except for the Excluded Assets,
the services to be provided to Buyer pursuant to the Transition Supply
Agreement, the Intangible Property subject to the Intangible Property License
Agreements, the assets of the Excluded Subsidiaries and the Business Employees
that are not Transferred Employees, the Acquired Assets constitute all assets
that are owned, leased or licensed by the Sellers and used in the Business as
currently conducted.

        Section 3.3      Authority of Sellers; Binding Effect.

               (a) Each Seller (other than TG Canada) has the requisite
corporate or other power and authority to file the Petitions and, subject to the
entry of the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the consummation by Buyer
of the Contemplated Transactions under Sections 105, 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, substantially in the form of Exhibit 3.3(a) (the "Sale Order"),
to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, this Agreement and
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The filing of the Petitions, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and, subject to the entry of the Sale
Order, the performance of its respective obligations hereunder have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of each Seller
(other than TG Canada), as the case may be. Subject to the entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order, each Seller (other than TG Canada) has full power and
authority to pay the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement without further
order of the Bankruptcy Court, and the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement shall each constitute an administrative expense of Sellers (other
than TG Canada) under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.

               (b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by each Seller (other than TG Canada) and, subject to the entry of the
Sale Order, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer, will be a valid and binding obligation of each Seller (other
than TG Canada), enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms,
except as the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable
principles of general applicability. Each of the instruments and agreements
hereunder to which each Seller (other than TG Canada) is or becomes a party has
been or will be duly authorized and, subject to the entry of the Sale Order, is
(or upon execution and delivery will be) a valid and binding obligation of such
Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of
general applicability.

               (c) TG Canada has the requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, this Agreement to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery by TG
Canada of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of TG Canada.
TG Canada has full power and authority to pay the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement.

               (d) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by TG Canada and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, will be

                                       13

<PAGE>

a valid and binding obligation of TG Canada, enforceable against TG Canada in
accordance with its terms, except as the availability of equitable remedies may
be limited by equitable principles of general applicability. Each of the
instruments and agreements hereunder to which TG Canada is or becomes a party
has been or will be duly authorized and is (or upon execution and delivery will
be) a valid and binding obligation of TG Canada, enforceable against TG Canada
in accordance with its terms, except as the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability.

        Section 3.4      Governmental Consents and Approvals. No consent,
approval, authorization of, declaration, filing or registration with, any
Governmental Authority is required to be made or obtained by any Seller in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, except for: (a) consents,
approvals, authorizations of, declarations, or filings with the Bankruptcy
Court, (b) the filing of a notification and report form under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), if necessary, and the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable
waiting period thereunder, (c) the filing of required notifications under
applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws and regulations and the receipt
of any necessary approvals thereunder, (d) consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings and registrations that are set forth in Schedule 3.4 and
(e) such other consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and
registrations the lack of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The
items referred to in clauses (a) through (d) of this Section 3.4 are hereinafter
referred to as the "Governmental Requirements."

        Section 3.5      No Violations. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order,
and assuming that the Governmental Requirements will be satisfied, made, or
obtained and will remain in full force and effect, and assuming receipt of the
consents, approvals and authorization of the Persons listed on Schedule 3.5, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Sellers, and the
consummation by any Seller of the Contemplated Transactions, and compliance by
any Seller with any of the provisions hereof, will not (a) violate any provision
of the charter, bylaws or any other organizational document of any Seller
(unless the same is rendered inapplicable by order the Bankruptcy Court), (b)
except for breaches and defaults of the type referred to in Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of or default
under (or with notice, lapse of time, or both would result in such a breach or
default), or constitute an event creating rights of acceleration, termination or
cancellation under, any Assumed Contract, on the date hereof, (c) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation or other Applicable
Law applicable to any Seller or to any properties or assets of a Seller, (d)
result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance other than Permitted
Encumbrances on any asset of any Seller or (e) violate any Permit or the terms
of any Intangible Property, except in each case for violations, breaches,
defaults, accelerations, terminations or cancellations that (i) would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) are
excused by or unenforceable as a result of the filing of the Petitions or the
applicability of any provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

        Section 3.6      Title to and Use of Property. Upon entry and
effectiveness of, and in accordance with the terms of, the Sale Order and the
Bankruptcy Code, and upon receipt of the release of the Parent's lenders,
Sellers shall have the power and right to sell, assign, transfer and deliver, as
the case may be, to Buyer the Acquired Assets free and clear of any and all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities.

        Section 3.7      Financial Statements. The financial statements set
forth on Schedule 3.7 (the "Unaudited Financials") are in accordance with
Parent's books and records and reflect, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Business on a consolidated basis as of the date thereof, and the
results of operations and cash flows of the Business on a consolidated basis for
the fiscal period then ended, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods

                                       14

<PAGE>

involved, subject to the absence of footnotes and year-end adjustments.

        Section 3.8      Contracts. All material written Contracts to which any
Seller is a party have been delivered or made available to Buyer. Except as
otherwise set forth on Schedule 3.8 or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Assumed Contracts is valid, binding
and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, except for defaults of the type referred to
in Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, there are no defaults (or events that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) by any Seller or,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, any other party under any of the Assumed Contracts.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5, no Assumed Contract prohibits or requires
the consent of any Person to the Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, it shall not be deemed a breach of the
representations set forth in this Section 3.8 if any party to an Assumed
Contract with any Seller terminates such Assumed Contract and enters into an
agreement with Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) on substantially similar (or
better) terms.

        Section 3.9      Intangible Property.

               (a) All permits, licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or
permissions under which any Seller is a licensee or otherwise authorized to use,
practice, sublicense, distribute or otherwise commercially exploit in any manner
any material Intangible Property owned by a third party ("IP License-In
Agreements") are set forth in Schedule 3.9(a)(i) and are binding against such
Seller and in full force and effect, in each case except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Sellers have provided or made
available true and accurate copies of all IP License-In Agreements to Buyer.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(a)(i), the rights licensed under each IP
License-In Agreement by Gasboy or TG Canada, as the case may be, will be
exercisable by Buyer on and after the Closing to the same extent as by Gasboy or
TG Canada, as the case may be, prior to the Closing. No loss or expiration
(other than pursuant to its terms) of any material Intangible Property licensed
to any Seller under any IP License-In Agreement is pending or reasonably
foreseeable or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened. No licensor under any
IP License-In Agreement has any ownership or exclusive license rights in or with
respect to any material improvements made by any Seller to the intellectual
property licensed thereunder. All permits, licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements or permissions under which any Seller is a licensor of any material
Intangible Property ("IP License-Out Agreements") are set forth in Schedule
3.9(a)(ii) and are binding against such Seller and in full force and effect, in
each case except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Sellers have provided or made available true and accurate copies of all
IP License-Out Agreements to Buyer.

               (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(b) or as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, Sellers (i) are the
sole and exclusive owners, free and clear of all Encumbrances (except Permitted
Encumbrances), of all right, title and interest in their respective material
Intangible Property except to the extent such Intangible Property is licensed by
a third party to such Seller under an IP License-In Agreement and designated as
licensed-in Intangible Property in Schedule 3.9(b) ("Licensed-In Intangible
Property") and (ii) hold valid licenses with sufficient rights and
authorizations to use or practice the Licensed-In Intangible Property as
licensed to such Seller. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(b), Sellers have
the right to use and assign all right, title and interest in their respective
Intangible Property without seeking the approval or consent of any third party
and without payments to any third party. Except as indicated on the schedules to
this Agreement, the Intangible Property included in the Acquired Assets together
with the Intangible Property to be licensed to Buyer under the Intangible
Property License Agreement and any Intangible Property subject to a Contract
which has been made available or provided to Buyer and Buyer has elected not to
include as an Assumed Contract, constitutes all of the intellectual property
necessary to conduct the Acquired Business as it is

                                       15

<PAGE>

presently conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All registrations and applications for the Intangible
Property are in full force and effect, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no existing or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened claims or proceedings by any Person relating to
the use by any Seller of the Intangible Property or challenging its ownership of
the same, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(b), to the
Knowledge of Sellers, there are no material infringing or diluting uses of the
Intangible Property, and no investigations are pending concerning the
possibility of such infringing or diluting use.

               (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(c) and except to the

(other than TG Canada) performance hereunder, the sale of the Acquired Assets
free and clear of all liens, claims (as defined in Section 101(5) of the
Bankruptcy Code) and interests, and the assumption and assignment of the Assumed
Contracts as provided in this Agreement. Buyer and TG Canada shall cooperate
with Sellers (other than TG Canada) in obtaining such Bankruptcy Court approval,
including providing evidence, if requested, of Buyer's ability to perform the
obligations of Sellers (other than TG Canada) under the Assumed Contracts to be
assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3(a).

        Section 5.8      Bidding Procedures. Set forth below are bidding
procedures (the "Bidding Procedures") substantially in the form of those to be
employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the sale of the Acquired
Assets to Buyer (the "Sale"). The Sale is subject to competitive bidding as set
forth herein and approval by the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing under Sections
363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Sale Hearing"). The following overbid
provisions and related bid protections are designed to compensate Buyer for its
efforts and agreements to date and to facilitate a full and fair process
designed to maximize the value of the Acquired Assets for the benefit of
Sellers' stakeholders.

               (a) Bid Deadline. All Bids must be submitted to Sellers c/o
William R. Kunkel at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), 333 West
Wacker Drive, Suite 1900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, with a copy to Andrew Torgove
at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Capital, 685 Third Avenue, New York, New York
10017 and James B. Boles, Chief Restructuring Officer, at Tokheim Corporation,
1600 Wabash Avenue, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46803, no later than 11:00 a.m. (CST) on
the date which is eight (8) Business Days prior to the date scheduled by the
Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing (the "Bid Deadline"). Sellers will
distribute by facsimile transmission, personal delivery or reliable overnight
courier service in accordance with Section 8.3 a copy of each Bid upon receipt
to (i) counsel to any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the
Bankruptcy Cases, (ii) the agent under that certain Post-Confirmation Credit
Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2000, of Parent (the "Agent"), (iii) counsel
to Sellers' proposed debtor-in-possession lenders and (iv) counsel to Buyer. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Bid" shall mean an indication of interest from a
Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement on terms substantially
similar to the Confidentiality Agreement and who Parent has determined is
financially able to consummate the purchase described in the marked copy of the
Definitive Sale Documentation (a "Qualified Bidder"), stating that (x) such
Qualified Bidder offers to purchase the Business, or a material portion thereof,
upon the terms and conditions set forth in a copy of this Agreement, together
with all Exhibits and Schedules hereto (the "Definitive Sale Documentation"),
marked to show those amendments and modifications to the Definitive Sale
Documentation, including, but not limited to, price and the time of closing,
that such Qualified Bidder proposes, (y) such Qualified Bidder is prepared to
enter into and consummate the transaction within not more than ten days after
approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order, subject to receipt of any
governmental or regulatory approvals and (z) such Qualified Bidder's offer is
irrevocable until the closing of a purchase of the Acquired Assets to the same
extent as provided in this Agreement.

               (b) Qualified Bid. Only Qualified Bids will qualify for
consideration at the Auction. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Qualified Bid"
is a Bid that:

                                       24

<PAGE>

                         (i) complies in all respects with Section 5.8(a);

                         (ii) if and only if, as of the Bid Deadline, the
        conditions described in Section 6.1 have been satisfied and no action
        described in Section 6.1(b) shall have been threatened, is a proposal
        that Parent determines has a value, when taken together with the value
        of any Acquired Assets that would be retained by Sellers or transferred
        to another purchaser, greater than or equal to the sum of (A) the value,
        as reasonably determined by the independent financial advisor of
        Sellers, of Buyer's offer plus (B) the amount of the Break-Up Fee plus
        (C) the amount of the Expense Reimbursement plus (D) in the case of the
        initial Qualified Bid (other than Buyer's Qualified Bid represented by
        this Agreement), 1.5% of the Cash Consideration plus (E) in the case of
        any subsequent Qualified Bids, 0.5% of the Cash Consideration;

                         (iii) is substantially on the same or better terms and
        conditions as set forth in a copy of Definitive Sale Documentation; and

                         (iv) is accompanied by evidence of committed financing
        or other ability to perform satisfactory to Parent.

If Sellers do not receive any Qualified Bids, Sellers will report the same to
the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed with a sale and assignment of the Acquired
Assets to Buyer and the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities. This
Agreement executed by Buyer shall constitute a Qualified Bid for all purposes.

               (c) Auction, Bidding Increments and Bids Remaining Open.

                         (i) If Sellers receive a Qualified Bid (other than
        Buyer's Qualified Bid represented by this Agreement), Sellers will
        conduct an auction (the "Auction") at the offices of Skadden, Arps,
        Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois) on a date that is no less than one (1)
        Business Day, and no more than three (3) Business Days, prior to the
        date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, beginning
        at 11:00 a.m. (CST) or such later time or other place as Sellers shall
        notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids;
        provided, however, that in no event shall the Sale Hearing occur prior
        to the 60th day following the Execution Date. Sellers shall notify all
        Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids of the actual date
        of the Auction at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date
        scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing. Only Buyer,
        Sellers, any representative of any official committee appointed in the
        Bankruptcy Cases, the Agent, any agent banks under any
        debtor-in-possession facility and any Qualified Bidders who have timely
        submitted Qualified Bids, in each case together with their counsel and
        financial advisors, shall be entitled to attend the Auction, and only
        Buyer and Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any subsequent
        Qualified Bids at the Auction. Bidding at the Auction will continue
        until such time as the highest or otherwise best offer is determined.
        Sellers may announce at the Auction additional or different procedural
        rules that are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., the amount of
        time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for conducting the Auction so
        long as such rules are not materially inconsistent with these Bidding
        Procedures.

                         (ii) At least one Business Day prior to the Auction,
        Sellers will give Buyer and all other Qualified Bidders a copy of the
        highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid received.

                                       25

               (d) Break-Up Fee. In consideration of Buyer's entering into this
Agreement and in recognition of Buyer's work in (x) establishing a bid standard
or minimum for other bidders, (y) placing estate property in a sales
configuration mode attracting other bidders to the Auction and (z) for serving,
by its name and its expressed interest, as a catalyst for other bidders, and as
reimbursement of Buyer's expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions, Sellers shall pay to Buyer (A) a break-up fee in
the amount of 1.0% of the Cash Consideration allocable to any portion of the
Acquired Business, pursuant to Section 1.6, that Buyer does not purchase (the
"Break-Up Fee") and (B) an amount (in no event to exceed 2.5% of the Cash
Consideration allocable to any portion of the Acquired Business, pursuant to
Section 1.6, that Buyer does not purchase) equal to Buyer's actual expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
(the "Expense Reimbursement"), if:

                         (i) Sellers accept a Bid, other than that of Buyer, as
        the highest offer and consummate such transaction (an "Auction
        Transaction") with respect to the Tokheim Assets or the Gasboy Assets,
        Sellers shall pay Buyer the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
        with respect to that portion of the Acquired Business subject to such
        Bid. The Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement payable pursuant to
        this Section 5.8(d)(i) shall be paid as an administrative priority of
        Sellers (other than TG Canada) under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy
        Code upon the earlier to occur of the closing of such Auction
        Transaction and the consummation of a plan of reorganization; or

                         (ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
        Section 7.1(e) and (B) within 180 days of such termination of this
        Agreement, Sellers enter into a Contract to sell or otherwise transfer
        all or any substantial portion of the Tokheim Assets or the Gasboy
        Assets to any Person other than Buyer and such sale is consummated,
        Sellers shall pay Buyer the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
        with respect to that portion of the Acquired Business subject to such
        sale. The Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement payable pursuant to
        this Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be paid as an administrative priority of
        Sellers (other than TG Canada) under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy
        Code upon the closing of such sale.

                         (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
        contrary, the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement shall only be
        payable in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above and in no event
        shall Sellers be liable to pay such a Break-Up Fee or an Expense
        Reimbursement with respect to any portion of the Acquired Business to
        Buyer on more than one occasion.

               (e) Auction Transactions. Sellers shall not be permitted to
engage in one or more Auction Transactions unless such Auction Transactions and
any other asset or stock sales by Sellers shall have an aggregate cash component
of at least an amount sufficient to satisfy the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement and aggregate cash deposits in an amount at least equal to 3.5% of
the aggregate cash consideration payable to Sellers in connection with such
Auction Transactions.

        Section 5.9      Non-Competition. In furtherance of the sale of the
Acquired Business to Buyer hereunder by virtue of the Contemplated Transactions
and more effectively to protect the value and goodwill of the Acquired Business
so sold, Sellers covenant and agree that, except with respect to the continued
operation and sale of the assets of Sellers that are not Acquired Assets
(including the continued operation and sale of the Excluded Subsidiaries and the
continued operation and sale of services pursuant to the Transition Supply
Agreement), Sellers shall not, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, (a) engage in any business which is in direct competition with the
Acquired Business (as conducted

                                       26

<PAGE>

as of the date hereof) in the United States or Canada, (b) solicit, induce or
attempt to persuade any of the current customers of the Business in the United
States and Canada or any Transferred Employees or agents of the Acquired
Business to terminate such business, employment or agency relationship in order
to enter into any such relationship in the United States or Canada for, with or
on behalf of Sellers or any Affiliate or to otherwise engage in activities in
direct competition with the Business or (c) divulge or make use of any trade
secrets or other confidential information of the Acquired Business (other than
to disclose such secrets and information to Buyer and its Affiliates). In the
event that the provisions of this Section 5.9 should ever be deemed to exceed
the time or geographic limitations or any other limitations permitted by
Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed
reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum permitted by Applicable Law. In the
event any Seller violates any of its obligations under this Section 5.9, Buyer
may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a
court may deem appropriate. Sellers acknowledge that a violation of this Section
5.9 may cause Buyer irreparable harm that may not be adequately compensated for
by money damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit the activities of the Excluded Subsidiaries
to the extent the Excluded Subsidiaries are not using the Acquired Assets or
subject to the Intangible Property License Agreements.

        Section 5.10     Notice of Breach; Disclosure. The Sellers shall
promptly notify the Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers, of (a)
any event, condition or circumstance of which any Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, becomes aware after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date that
would constitute a violation or breach of this Agreement (or a breach of any
representation or warranty contained herein) or, if the same were to continue to
exist as of the Closing Date, would constitute the non-satisfaction of any of
the conditions set forth in Article VI, as the case may be or (b) any event,
occurrence, transaction, or other item of which the Buyer or any Seller, as the
case may be, becomes aware which would have been required to have been disclosed
on any schedule or statement delivered hereunder had such event, occurrence,
transaction or item existed as of the date hereof.

        Section 5.11     Payment Under Assumed Contracts and Determination of
Cure Costs. As promptly as practicable following the filing of the Petitions,
Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and
determine an estimate of the amounts required to cure all defaults under each
Assumed Contract so as to permit the assumption and assignment of each such
Assumed Contract pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (as ultimately
determined by the Bankruptcy Court, the "Cure Costs"). In connection with the
assignment and assumption of the Assumed Contracts, Sellers shall cure any past
defaults by payment of any Cure Costs, up to $500,000 in the aggregate (the
"Cure Cap"), in order to assume and assign to Buyer the Assumed Contracts. Buyer
shall pay any Cure Costs in excess of the Cure Cap, provided that the Cure Costs
paid by Buyer shall not reduce the Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt,
the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall not apply to any Assumed Contract to
which TG Canada is a party or by which its assets may be bound that is not
subject to assumption and assignment pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

        Section 5.12     Further Assurances. In addition to the provisions of
this Agreement, from time to time after the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer will
use all commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance, transfer, or assumption, as the case may be, and take
such other action as may be reasonably requested to implement more effectively
the Contemplated Transactions.

        Section 5.13     Employee Matters. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall make
employment offers to certain employees of the Business (the "Business
Employees"). Any Business Employees who accept the Buyer's offer are hereinafter
referred to as "Transferred Employees." Buyer shall have no further obligations
with respect to Business Employees who do not accept Buyer's offer. Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall permit and allow reasonable access by Buyer to
discuss and make

                                       27

<PAGE>

offers of post-Closing employment with any of Sellers' employees.

        Section 5.14     No-Shop. Subject to the exceptions stated in this
Section 5.14 and prior to the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding
Procedures Order (after which time such final order shall govern any
solicitations by Sellers with respect to any Alternative Transaction), Sellers
shall not take, nor shall they permit any of their respective Affiliates (or
authorize or permit any of their representatives acting for or on behalf of any
Seller or any of its Affiliates) to take, directly or indirectly, any action to
solicit or negotiate any offer from any Person concerning an Alternative
Transaction; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit furnishing
confidential information with respect to the Business or permitting access to
the assets and properties and books and records of any Seller). If, prior to the
entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding Procedures Order, Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates (or any representative acting for or on their
behalf) receives from any Person any offer, inquiry or informational request
referred to above, Sellers shall promptly advise such Person, by written notice,
of the motion filed with the Bankruptcy Court seeking entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order and will promptly, orally and in writing, advise Buyer of such
offer, inquiry or request and deliver a copy of such notice to Buyer, except to
the extent so doing would violate an existing confidentiality agreement. For
purposes of this Section 5.14, an "Alternative Transaction" means any proposal
for a merger or other business combination involving Sellers with respect to the
Acquired Business, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, substantially all of the business of Parent or an Equity Security
in, or a substantial portion of the assets of, any of the Excluded Subsidiaries,
shall not be deemed an Alternative Transaction.

        Section 5.15     Monthly Financial Reports. Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer a copy of the monthly financial reporting packages (the "Monthly Financial
Reports") that are required or proposed to be required to be sent to the lenders
under any debtor-in-possession credit agreement entered into by Sellers in
connection with the filing of the Petitions for each full month following the
date of this Agreement (including the month in which this Agreement is signed)
until Closing, which copies shall be delivered to Buyer within the time period
required for delivery of the Monthly Financial Reports to such lenders.

        Section 5.16     Change of Name. Sellers shall file amendments to the
certificates of incorporation or certificates of formation of each such Seller
changing its name to a name not using the names "Gasboy," "Tokheim," "Sunbelt,"
"Management Solutions" or "MSI" or any name that is similar thereto within 120
days after the Closing Date in the appropriate government office.

        Section 5.17     Collection of Accounts Receivable. If, following the
Closing, (i) Sellers shall collect any Receivables belonging to Buyer, Sellers
shall hold the same in trust and shall promptly pay the same over to Buyer, or
(ii) Buyers shall collect any receivables belonging to Seller, Buyer shall hold
the same in trust and shall promptly pay the same over to Seller.

        Section 5.18     Administrative Claims. All amounts to be paid to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute an allowed administrative expense
claim with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the kind
specified in Sections 503 and 507 of the Bankruptcy Code, and shall be, at
Buyer's option and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, (i) immediately
payable if and when any such obligation of Sellers arises under this Agreement
or the Bidding Procedures Order, or (ii) credited against any amounts owed by
Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 5.19     Releases. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all releases from Parent's lenders that are necessary in order
for Sellers to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

                                       28

<PAGE>

        Section 5.20     Capitalized Leases. With respect to all capitalized
leases relating to the Acquired Business, (a) Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to pay in full all such capitalized leases prior
to the Closing and (b) in the event any such capitalized leases are not paid in
full prior to the Closing, Sellers and Buyer hereby agree that any amounts owing
under such capitalized leases as of the Closing shall, subject to the last
sentence of Sections 2.7(e) and 2.7(f), respectively, be deducted from the
Gasboy Current Assets or the Tokheim Current Assets, as appropriate, otherwise
shown on the Current Assets Statement.

        Section 5.21     Title Insurance. At Buyer's expense, Sellers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining all required
title insurance policies with respect to the Real Property designating Buyer as
the insured, with all premiums thereon paid by Buyer.

        Section 5.22     Schedules.

               (a) Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on behalf of Sellers, on
the other hand, shall have the right to make changes to the Schedules to this
Agreement to correct manifest errors that are discovered between the Execution
Date and the Auction.

               (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if at any time on or prior to December 4, 2002 or such other date as
Buyer and Parent may mutually agree, Buyer and Sellers shall not agree on the
Schedules to this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers shall each have the right to
terminate this Agreement and the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer.

        Section 5.23     Removal of Property. Buyer shall remove all Acquired
Assets from any Facility (other than any Facility that Buyer continues to own
after Closing) within thirty (30) days following the termination of the
Transition Supply Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

        Section 6.1      Conditions to Obligations of Sellers and Buyer. The

                                   TERMINATION

        Section 7.1      Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing Date:

               (a) by written agreement of Sellers and Buyer;

               (b) by either Sellers or Buyer, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other parties, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to the 100th day after the date hereof (the "Termination Date") (unless
the failure to consummate the Closing by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its
obligations under this Agreement).

               (c) by either Sellers or Buyer in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or taken any other

any representation or warranty of Buyer shall have been or become untrue, in
each case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would

8.18 and the Confidentiality Agreement, and except that nothing herein will
relieve any party from liability for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination (a
"Breach"); it being understood that the acceptance by Sellers of a Bid other
than Buyer's and seeking the approval of the Bankruptcy Court of a Bid other
than Buyer's in each case in compliance with Section 5.8 shall not constitute a
Breach for purposes of this Section 7.2. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event Buyer is entitled to receive
the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement upon termination of this
Agreement, the right of Buyer to receive such amounts shall constitute Buyer's
sole remedy for (and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in respect
of) any Breach by any Seller of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event Sellers are entitled to
receive the Deposit pursuant to Section 1.7 and 1.8, the right of Sellers to
receive such amount shall constitute Sellers' sole remedy for (and such amount
shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of) any Breach by Buyer of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

               (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that any claim for a Breach
must be brought within 30 days after this Agreement is terminated.

shall be entitled to have and recover from the non-prevailing party all such
fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees) as the prevailing party may suffer or incur in the
pursuit or defense of such action or proceeding.
