                                                                    Exhibit 10.1

                           University of Pennsylvania

                     Amended and Restated License Agreement

This Amended and Restated License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between The
Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation
("Penn"), and Neose Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation and successor to
Paromel Corp. ("Company"). This will become effective as of February 27, 2003
(the "Effective Date").

                                   BACKGROUND

Penn and Company are parties to a License Agreement dated August 28, 1990, as
amended April 14, 1995 (the "Prior License Agreement") with respect to certain
intellectual property developed by Dr. Stephen Roth relating to the synthesis of
saccharides and oligosaccharides using enzymatic techniques, and with the design
and synthesis of commodity and therapeutic compositions and methods employing
saccharides and oligosaccharides prepared through enzymatic techniques, and
patents relating to such intellectual property.

Contemporaneously with the entry into the Prior License Agreement, Penn and
Company also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement and a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), under which there are no obligations
remaining to be performed by either party.

Penn and Company desire to amend and restate the Prior License Agreement as
hereinafter set forth, and Penn has determined that this Agreement is in the
best interest of Penn and is consistent with its educational and research
missions and goal.

In consideration of the mutual obligations contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

1.       LICENSE

         1.1 License Grant. Penn grants to Company an exclusive, world-wide
license (the "License") to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale
Licensed Products in the Field of Use during the Term (as such terms may be
defined in Sections 1.2 and 6.1). The License includes the right to sublicense
as permitted by this Agreement. No other rights or licenses are granted by Penn.

         1.2 Related Definitions. The term "Licensed Products" means products
that are made, made for, used, imported, sold or offered for sale by Company or
its Affiliates or sublicensees and that either (i) in the absence of this
Agreement, would infringe at least one claim of the Penn Patent Rights or (ii)
use a process or apparatus covered by a claim of Penn Patent Rights. The term
"Penn Patent Rights" means all patent rights represented by or issuing from: (a)
the United States patent applications listed in Exhibit A; (b) any continuation,
divisional and re-issue applications and continuation-in-part applications of
(a); and (c) any foreign counterparts and extensions of (a) or (b). The term
"Affiliate" means a legal entity that is controlling, controlled by or under
common control with Company and that has executed either this Agreement or a
written Joinder Agreement agreeing

<PAGE>

to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes
of this Section 1.2, the word "control" means (x) the direct or indirect
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting securities of
a legal entity, (y) the right to receive fifty percent (50%) or more of the
profits or earnings of a legal entity, or (z) the right to determine the policy
decisions of a legal entity. The term "Field of Use" means the biochemical field
of saccharide and oligosaccharide synthesis (including, but not limited to,
saccharide and oligosaccharide conjugates of any lipid, glycolipid, protein,
glycoprotein or related composition) employing enzymatic techniques, as well as
oligosaccharide and polysaccharide/cell receptor interaction.

         1.3 Reservation of Rights by Penn. Penn reserves the right to use, and
to permit other non-commercial entities to use, the Penn Patent Rights for
educational and research purposes.

         1.4 U.S. Government Rights. The parties acknowledge that the United
States government retains rights in intellectual property funded under any grant
or similar contract with a Federal agency. The License is expressly subject to
all applicable United States government rights, including, but not limited to,
any applicable requirement that products, which result from such intellectual
property and are sold in the United States, must be substantially manufactured
in the United States.

         1.5 Sublicense Conditions. The Company's right to sublicense granted by
Penn under the License is subject to each of the following conditions:

             (a) Company will require the sublicensee to comply with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

             (b) Within thirty (30) days after Company enters into a sublicense
agreement, Company will deliver to Penn a complete and accurate copy of the
entire sublicense agreement written in the English language. Penn's receipt of
the sublicense agreement, however, will constitute neither an approval of the
sublicense nor a waiver of any right of Penn or obligation of Company under this
Agreement.

             (c) In the event that Company causes or experiences a Trigger Event
(as defined in Section 6.4), all payments due to Company from its Affiliates or
sublicensees under the sublicense agreement will, upon notice from Penn to such
Affiliate or sublicensee, become payable directly to Penn for the account of
Company. Upon receipt of any such funds, Penn will remit to Company the amount
by which such payments exceed the amounts owed by Company to Penn.

             (d) Company's execution of a sublicense agreement will not relieve
Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

2.       DILIGENCE

         2.1 Company's Efforts. Company will use commercially reasonable efforts
to develop, commercialize, market and sell Licensed Products. Within sixty (60)
days after the Effective Date and on each December 1 thereafter, Company must
provide Penn with a written progress report, setting forth in reasonable detail
the progress of the development, evaluation, testing and commercialization of
each Licensed Product ("Developmental Progress Report"). Company shall also
notify Penn within thirty (30) days of the first commercial Sale by the Company,
an Affiliate, or

                                        2

<PAGE>

any sublicensee of each Licensed Product. The Developmental Progress Report will
include at a minimum the information listed in Exhibit C.

3        FEES AND ROYALTIES

         3.1 Issuance of Shares and Payment under Prior License Agreement. Upon
execution of the Prior License Agreement, Company issued to Penn certain shares
of Common Stock of Company pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Penn and
Company agree that no amounts are payable by Company to Penn under the Prior
License Agreement in respect of the period prior to the Effective Date.

         3.2 Earned Royalties. In partial consideration of the License, Company
will pay to Penn a royalty of three percent (3%) of Net Sales during each
Quarter, commencing with the Quarter ending March 31, 2003. The term "Quarter"
means each three-month period beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and
October 1. The term "Net Sales" means the amount received by Company from each
sale of Licensed Product ("Sale"), less Qualifying Costs directly attributable
to a Sale and borne by Company or its Affiliates or sublicensees. The term
"Qualifying Costs" means: (a) customary discounts in the trade for quantity
purchased, prompt payment or wholesalers and distributors; (b) credits or
refunds for claims or returns that do not exceed the original invoice amount;
(c) transportation and insurance charges paid by the seller; and (d) sales, use,
excise, value-added and other taxes and other fees imposed by a governmental
agency measured by Sales.

         3.3 Stacking Protection. If (a) Company becomes obligated to pay
royalties to third parties for technology necessary to develop or manufacture a
Licensed Product and (b) the aggregate royalty rate owed by Company to all
parties (including Penn) to develop and manufacture a Licensed Product exceeds
ten percent (10%), then the royalty rate applicable to Penn under Section 3.2
for such Licensed Product will be reduced to the stacked royalty calculated by
the following formula:

             SR = A(10/A+B)

             Where:
             SR = Stacked Royalty payable to Penn
             A = royalty rate payable to Penn before reduction
             B = sum of royalty rates owed by Company, before stacking, to all
                 third parties

In no event, however, will the royalty rate applicable to Penn under Section 3.2
for a Licensed Product be reduced to less than one and three-quarters percent
(1.75%). A reduction of the royalty rate in Section 3.2 for one Licensed Product
will not affect the royalty rate for another Licensed Product.

         3.4 Sublicense Fees. In partial consideration of the License, Company
will pay to Penn a sublicense fee of five percent (5%) of all payments and the
fair value of all other consideration of any kind received by Company each
Quarter, commencing with the Quarter ending March 31, 2003 from sublicensees of
the Penn Patent Rights during the Quarter, other than: (a) royalties paid to
Company by a sublicensee based upon sales or net sales by the sublicensee; (b)
equity investments in Company by a sublicensee up to the amount of the fair
market value of the equity purchased on the date of the investment; (c) loan
proceeds paid to Company by a sublicensee in an arms length,

                                        3

<PAGE>

full recourse debt financing; (d) funding paid to Company for future internal
research and development; and (e) funding paid to Company for clinical testing.

         3.5 Renegotiation Fee. In partial consideration of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Company will pay to Penn a one-time, non-refundable,
non-creditable renegotiation fee of $100,000, payable in four equal
installments, as follows:

             $25,000_____ on February 28, 2003
             $25,000_____ on March 31, 2003
             $25,000_____ on April 30, 2003
             $25,000_____ on May 31, 2003

4        REPORTS AND PAYMENTS

         4.1 Royalty Reports. Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each
Quarter, Company will deliver to Penn a report, certified by the chief financial
officer of Company, detailing the calculation of all royalties and fees due to
Penn for such Quarter. The report will include, at a minimum: (a) the number of
Licensed Products involved in Sales, listed by product, by country; (b) gross
consideration invoiced, billed or received by Company, its Affiliates, or
sublicensees for Sales in the Quarter; (c) Qualifying Costs, listed by category

         4.2 Payments. Company will pay all royalties and fees due to Penn under
Article 3 within forty-five (45) days after the end of the Quarter in which the
royalties or fees accrue.

         4.3 Records. Company will maintain complete and accurate books and
records to verify Sales, Net Sales, and all of the royalties, fees, and other
payments due under this Agreement, and Company will use its best efforts to
require its sublicensees to do likewise. The Company's records for each Quarter
will be maintained for at least four (4) years after submission of the
applicable report required under Section 4.1.

         4.4 Audit Rights. Upon reasonable prior written notice to Company,
Company will provide Penn and a firm of independent certified public accountants
reasonably satisfactory to Company, which is selected and paid for by Penn, with
access to all of the books and records required to be maintained by Company
under Section 4.3 to conduct a review or audit of Sales, Net Sales, and all of
the royalties, fees, and other payments payable under this Agreement solely for
the purpose of determining the correctness of any payments made and information
as to payments due for any period in which Company has failed to report or to
make payment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Access will be made
available: (a) during normal business hours; (b) in a manner reasonably designed
to facilitate Penn's review or audit without unreasonable disruption to
Company's business; and (c) no more than once each calendar year during the Term
and for a period of three (3) years thereafter. Company will promptly pay to
Penn the amount of any underpayment determined by the review or audit plus
accrued interest. If the review or audit determines that Company has underpaid
any royalty payment by five percent (5%) or more, then Company will also
promptly pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Penn in connection with the
review or audit.

         4.5 Currency. All dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement are
expressed in United States dollars. All payments will be made in United States
dollars. If Company receives payment from a third party in a currency other than
United States dollars for which a royalty or fee is owed under this Agreement,
then (a) the payment will be converted into United States dollars at the
conversion rate for the foreign currency as published in the eastern edition of
the Wall Street Journal as of the last business day of the Quarter in which the
payment was received by Company, and (b) the conversion computation will be
documented by Company in the applicable report delivered to Penn under Section
4.1.

laws, rules and regulations that apply to its activities or obligations under
this Agreement. For example, Company will comply with applicable United States

it, either directly or by merger or operation of law, except to a purchaser of
Company's business relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or with the

the assignee agrees in writing to be legally bound by this Agreement; and (c)
the assignee agrees to deliver to Penn an updated Development Plan within
forty-five (45) days after the closing of the proposed transaction. Any
permitted assignment will not relieve Company of responsibility for performance
of any obligation of Company that has accrued at the time of the assignment. Any
prohibited assignment will be null and void.

"Notice") must be in writing, addressed to the party's respective Notice Address
listed on the signature page, and delivered: (a) personally; (b) by certified
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; (c) by recognized overnight

concerning any right or duty under this Agreement, then the parties will confer,
