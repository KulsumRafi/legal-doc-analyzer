lien, in form satisfactory to the Secured Party, from each mortgagee or lessor
of real property (other than the Secured Party) on which any of the Collateral

covering the Collateral against such risks, with such insurers, in such form,
and in such amounts as shall from time to time be required by Secured Party, but
in any event, in such amounts and with such coverage as is customary in Debtor's
type of business. All insurance policies shall be written so as to be payable in
the event of loss to Secured Party and shall provide for thirty (30) days'
written notice to Secured Party of cancellation or modification. At the request
of Secured Party, all insurance policies shall be furnished to and held by
Secured Party. Debtor hereby assigns to Secured Party return premiums, dividends
and other amounts which may be or become due upon cancellation of any such
policies for any reason whatsoever and, during the existence of an Event of
Default (as defined hereinbelow) directs the insurers to pay Secured Party any
sums so due. Secured Party is hereby appointed as attorney irrevocable to
collect, during the existence of an Event of Default, return premiums, dividends
and other amounts due on any insurance policy and the proceeds of such
insurance, to settle any claims with the insurers in the event of loss or
damage, to endorse settlement drafts and, during the existence of an Event of
Default, to cancel, assign, or surrender any insurance policies. If, prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default, while any Secured Obligations are
outstanding, any return premiums, dividends, other amounts or proceeds are paid
to Debtor under such policies, Debtor shall take either or both of the following
actions: (i) apply such return premiums, dividends, other amounts and proceeds
in whole or in part to the payment or satisfaction of any of the Secured
Obligations; or (ii) use such return premiums, dividends, other amounts and
proceeds for the purpose of repairing or replacing the Collateral destroyed or
damaged. If, during the existence of an Event of Default, any return premiums,
dividends, other amounts or proceeds are paid to Secured Party under such
policies, such return premiums, dividends, other amounts and proceeds shall be
applied to the payment of the Secured Obligations..

      8. Receivables. Debtor agrees that Secured Party may communicate with
account debtors in order to verify the existence, amount, and terms of any
Receivables. Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Secured
Party may notify account debtors of the security interests established herein
and require that payments on Receivables be made directly to Secured


                                       8
<PAGE>
Party, and upon the request of Secured Party, Debtor shall notify account
debtors and indicate on all billings that payments and returns are to be made
directly to Secured Party. In furtherance of the foregoing, Debtor hereby
appoints Secured Party attorney irrevocable with full power, upon an Event of
Default and during the continuance thereof, to collect, compromise, endorse,
sell, or otherwise deal with the Receivables or proceeds thereof and to perform
the terms of any contract in order to create Receivables in Secured Party's name
or in the name of Debtor. This Agreement may be, but need not be, supplemented
by separate assignments of Receivables and contract rights and, if such
assignments are given, the rights and security interests given thereby shall be
in addition to and not in limitation of the rights and security interests
granted by this Agreement.

      9. Events of Default. The following events shall be deemed "Events of
Default" hereunder:

      Documents;

            (h) Secured Party may perform any warranty, covenant or agreement
      which Debtor has failed to perform under this Agreement; and

            (i) Secured Party may take any other action which Secured Party
      reasonably deems necessary or desirable to protect the Collateral or the
      security interests granted herein.

      11. Rights of Secured Party to Use and Operate Collateral. During the
existence of any Event of Default, but subject to the provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code or other applicable law, the Secured Party shall have the right
and power to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, and to
exclude the Debtor and all persons claiming under the Debtor wholly or partly
therefrom, and thereafter to hold, store, and/or use, operate, manage and
control the same. Upon any such taking of possession, the Secured Party may,
from time to time, at the expense of the Debtor, make all such repairs,
replacements, alterations, additions and improvements to and of the Collateral
as the Secured Party may reasonably deem proper. In any such case, subject as
aforesaid, the Secured Party shall have the right to manage and control the
Collateral and to carry on the business and to exercise all rights and powers of
the Debtor in respect thereto as the Secured Party shall deem best, including
the right to enter into any and all such agreements with respect to the leasing
and/or operation of the Collateral or any part thereof as the Secured Party may
see fit; and the Secured Party shall be entitled to collect and receive all
rents, issues, profits, fees, revenues and other income of the same and every
part thereof. Such rents, issues, profits, fees, revenues and other income shall
be applied to pay the expenses of holding and operating the Collateral and of
conducting the business thereof, and of all maintenance, repairs, replacements,
alterations, additions and repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and
improvements, and to make all payments which the Secured Party may be required
or may elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance and other
charges upon the Collateral or any part thereof, and all other payments which
the Secured Party may be required or authorized to make under any provision of
this Agreement (including reasonable legal costs and attorneys' fees). The
remainder of such rents, issues, profits, fees, revenues and other income shall
be applied to the payment of the Secured Obligations in such order of priority
as the Secured Party deems appropriate in its sole discretion and any surplus
shall be returned to the Debtor. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Secured Party shall have the right to apply for and have a
receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in any action taken by
the Secured Party to enforce their rights and remedies hereunder in order to
manage, protect and preserve the Collateral and continue the operation of the
business of the Debtor and to collect all revenues and profits thereof and apply
the same to the payment of all expenses and other charges of such receivership
including the compensation of the receiver and to the payment of the Secured
Obligations as aforesaid until a sale or other disposition of such Collateral
shall be finally made and consummated.

      12. Rights of Secured Party to Sell Collateral. During an Event of
Default, upon (10) days prior written notice by registered or certified mail by
Secured Party to Debtor at the address of the Debtor set forth above (or at such
other address or addresses as the Debtor shall specify in writing by like notice
to the Secured Party) of the time and place of any intended disposition of
Collateral, then Secured Party shall have the right and power to sell, assign,
lease, or otherwise dispose of the Collateral from any business premises of the
Debtor, either at public auction or private sale, by liquidation sale or other
disposition, or as if the sale was being made in the ordinary course of Debtor's
business, with or without notice to the public that the said sale or disposition
is for the benefit of the Secured Party; provided, however, that if the
Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a
type customarily sold on a recognized market, then Secured Party shall have the
right and power to dispose of the Collateral without prior notice to Debtor and
Debtor expressly waives any rights to notice under such circumstances. The
notices described above shall be deemed to meet any requirement hereunder or
under any applicable law (including the Uniform Commercial Code) that reasonable
notification be given of the time and place of such sale or other disposition.
After deducting all costs and expenses of collection, storage, custody, sale or
other disposition and delivery (including reasonable legal costs and attorneys'
fees) and all other charges against the Collateral, the residue of the proceeds
of any such sale or disposition shall be applied to the payment of the Secured
Obligations in accordance with such order of priority as the Secured Party deems
appropriate in its sole discretion and any surplus shall be returned to the
Debtor. In the event the proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of the
Collateral hereunder are insufficient to pay all of the Secured Obligations in
full, the Debtor will be liable for the deficiency, together with interest
thereon at the maximum rate provided in the Note and the cost and expenses of
collection of such deficiency, including, without limitation, reasonable fees of
attorneys, experts, and agents, expenses and disbursements.

      13. Attorney-in-Fact. The Debtor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Secured
Party at any time and from time to time to sign (if required) and file in any
appropriate filing office, wherever located, any financing statement that (a)
describes the Collateral in a manner consistent with Section 1 and (b) contains
any other information required by the Uniform Commercial Code of the applicable
jurisdiction for the sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing
statement, including (i) whether the Debtor is an organization, the type of
organization and any organization identification number issued to the Debtor
and, (ii) in the case of a financing statement filed as a fixture filing, a
sufficient description of real property to which the Collateral relates. The
Secured Party is hereby appointed the attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, of the Debtor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
this Agreement during the existence of an Event of Default and taking any action
and executing any instruments (including, without limitation, financing or
continuation statements, conveyances, assignments, and transfers) which the
Secured Party may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof,
which appointment as attorney-in-fact is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. The Debtor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Secured Party from
and against any liability or damage which it may incur in the

                                       12
<PAGE>
exercise and performance, in good faith, of the Secured Party's powers and
duties as such attorney-in-fact.

      14. Waiver, etc. The Debtor hereby waives presentment, demand, notice,
protest and, except as is otherwise provided herein, all other demands and
notices in connection with this Agreement or the enforcement of the Secured
Party's rights hereunder or in connection with any Secured Obligations or any
Collateral. The Debtor further consents to and waives notice of the granting of
renewals, extensions of time for payment or other indulgences to the Debtor or
to any account debtor in respect of any Receivable, substitution, release or
surrender of any Collateral, addition or release of persons primarily or
secondarily liable on any Secured Obligation or on any Receivable or other
Collateral, or the acceptance of partial payments on any Secured Obligation or
on any account receivable or other Collateral and/or the settlement or
compromise thereof. No delay or omission on the part of the Secured Party in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any
other right hereunder. Any waiver of any such right on any one occasion shall
not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right on any such future
occasion.

      15. Termination; Assignments, etc. This Agreement and the security
interest in the Collateral created hereby shall terminate when all of the
Secured Obligations have been paid, performed, and finally discharged in full.
In the event of a sale or assignment by the Secured Party of all or any of the
Secured Obligations held by it, such Secured Party may assign or transfer its
rights and interests under this Agreement in whole or in part to the purchaser
or purchasers of such Secured Obligations, whereupon such purchaser or
purchasers shall become vested with all of the powers and rights of such Secured
Party hereunder, and such Secured Party shall thereafter be forever released and
fully discharged from any liability or responsibility hereunder, with respect to
the rights and interests so assigned.

      16. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic communication)
and shall be either mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
delivered by overnight courier service, to the applicable party at the addresses
first set forth above, or, as to each party, at such other address as shall be
designated by such parties in a written notice to the other party complying as
to delivery with the terms of this Section. All such notices, requests, demands
and other communication shall be effective on the date of first attempted
delivery.

      17. Miscellaneous.

            (a) The powers conferred on the Secured Party hereunder are solely
      to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty
      upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any
      Collateral in its possession and the accounting for monies actually
      received by it hereunder, the Secured Party shall not have any duty as

                                       13

<PAGE>
      to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve
      any right of it or of the Debtor against other parties pertaining to any
      Collateral;

            (b) No provision hereof shall be amended except by a writing signed
      by the Secured Party and the Debtor;

            (c) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
      unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
      unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof;

            (d) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
      benefit of the successors and assigns of the Secured Party and the Debtor;

            (e) No delay, failure to enforce, or single or partial exercise on
      the part of the Secured Party in connection with any of its rights
      hereunder shall constitute an estoppel or waiver thereof, or preclude
      other or further exercises or enforcement thereof and no waiver of any
      default hereunder shall be a waiver of any subsequent default; and

            (f) This Agreement shall be governed as to its validity,
      interpretation and effect in accordance with the laws of the State of New
      Hampshire.

            (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
      other Loan Documents to the contrary, the security interests granted
      hereunder to the Secured Party shall not be, and shall not deemed to be,
      an assignment of any contract or agreement of the Debtor which does not
      permit such an assignment under the terms and conditions of such contract
      or agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no manner
      limit the effect of the collateral assignment hereunder to the Secured
      Party of the accounts arising under such contracts or agreements for the
      payment of money now due or hereafter becoming due to the Debtor
      thereunder, or of the security interests of the Secured Party therein, or
      of the Secured Party's rights with respect thereto under this Agreement.
