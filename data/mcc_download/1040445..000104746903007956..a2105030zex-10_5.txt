                 (iii)  treat the remaining amount of the Series 2002-3 Past Due
          Rent Payment as Principal Collections allocated to the Series 2002-3
          Notes in accordance with Section 3.2(a)(ii) or 3.2(b)(ii), as the case
          may be.

          Section 3.3. PAYMENTS TO NOTEHOLDERS. On each Determination Date, the
Funding Agent shall provide written notice to the Administrator of the Monthly
Funding Costs for the current Series 2002-3 Interest Period, and the

components of Monthly Funding Costs to accrue during the portion of such Series
2002-3 Interest Period succeeding such Determination Date. If the actual amount
of Monthly Funding Costs are less

                                      -25-

The Funding Agent shall determine the Monthly Funding Costs for the Series
2002-3 Interest Period immediately preceding the Series 2002-3 Termination Date

2002-3 Interest Period. If the Funding Agent determines that the Monthly Funding
Costs for the last Series 2002-3 Interest Period will be more or less than the

Administrator of such variance prior to the Distribution Date for such Series
2002-3 Interest Period. On each Determination Date, as provided below, the

     to pay the sum of the amounts described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of
     Section 3.3(a) above on such Distribution Date, the Administrator shall

          Section 3.6. ADMINISTRATOR'S FAILURE TO INSTRUCT THE TRUSTEE TO MAKE A
DEPOSIT OR PAYMENT. If the Administrator fails to give notice or instructions to
make any payment from or deposit into the Collection Account required to be
given by the Administrator, at the time specified in the Administration
Agreement or any other Related Document (including applicable grace periods),
the Trustee shall make such payment or deposit into or from the Collection
Account without such notice or instruction from the Administrator, PROVIDED that
the Administrator, upon request of the Trustee, promptly provides the Trustee
with all information necessary to allow the Trustee to make such a payment or
deposit. When any payment or deposit hereunder or under any other Related
Document is required to be made by the Trustee or the Paying Agent at or prior
to a specified time, the Administrator shall deliver any applicable written
instructions with respect thereto reasonably in advance of such specified time.

          Section 3.7. SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE ACCOUNT. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF
SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE ACCOUNT. AFC-II shall establish and maintain in the name
of the Series 2002-3 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-3 Noteholders, or
cause to be established and maintained, an account (the "SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE
ACCOUNT"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited
therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-3 Noteholders. The Series
2002-3 Reserve Account shall be maintained (i) with a Qualified Institution, or
(ii) as a segregated trust account with the corporate trust department of a
depository institution or trust company having corporate trust powers and acting
as trustee for funds deposited in the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account; PROVIDED
that, if at any time such Qualified Institution is no longer a Qualified
Institution or the credit rating of any securities issued by such depositary
institution or trust company shall be reduced to below BBB- by S&P or Baa2 by
Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within 30 days of such reduction, establish a new
Series 2002-3 Reserve Account with a new Qualified Institution. If the Series
2002-3 Reserve Account is not maintained in accordance with the previous
sentence, AFC-II shall establish a new Series 2002-3 Reserve Account, within ten
(10) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of such fact, which complies with
such sentence, and shall instruct the Series 2002-3 Agent in writing to transfer
all cash and investments from the non-qualifying Series 2002-3 Reserve Account
into the new Series 2002-3 Reserve Account. Initially, the Series 2002-3 Reserve
Account will be established with The Bank of New York.

          (b)    ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE ACCOUNT. The
Administrator may instruct the institution maintaining the Series 2002-3 Reserve
Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account from
time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
investment shall mature not later than the Business Day prior to the
Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were received, unless
any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account is held with
the Paying Agent, then such investment may mature on such Distribution Date and
such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such Distribution
Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to the Series 2002-3
Reserve Account and any such Permitted Investments that constitute (i) physical
property (and that is not either a United States security entitlement or a
security entitlement) shall be physically delivered to the Trustee; (ii) United
States security entitlements or security entitlements shall be controlled (as
defined in Section 8-106 of the New York UCC) by the Trustee pending maturity or
disposition, and (iii) uncertificated securities (and not United States security
entitlements) shall be delivered to the Trustee by causing the Trustee to become
the registered holder of such securities.

treated as a financial asset (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York
UCC) and (iii) to comply with any entitlement order (as defined in Section
8-102(a)(8) of the New York UCC) issued by the Trustee.

          (e)    SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE ACCOUNT SURPLUS. In the event that the
Series 2002-3 Reserve Account Surplus on any Distribution Date, after giving
effect to all withdrawals from the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account, is greater
than zero, the Trustee, acting in accordance with the written instructions of
the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement, shall withdraw from
the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account an amount equal to the Series 2002-3 Reserve
Account Surplus and shall pay such amount to AFC-II.

          (f)    TERMINATION OF SERIES 2002-3 RESERVE ACCOUNT. Upon the
termination of the Indenture pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Base Indenture, the
Trustee, acting in accordance with the written instructions of the
Administrator, after the prior payment of all amounts owing to the Series 2002-3
Noteholders and payable from the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account as provided
herein, shall withdraw from the Series 2002-3 Reserve Account all amounts on
deposit therein for payment to AFC-II.

<Page>

     statistical information with respect to the Vehicles subject to the Leases
     provided to the Funding Agent.

          (k)    PROCEEDINGS. All corporate and other proceedings and all other

     contemplated by the Related Documents shall be satisfactory in form and
     substance to the Funding Agent and its counsel.

          (l)    UCC FILINGS. The Funding Agent shall have received (i) executed
     originals of any documents (including, without limitation, financing

     the security interest of the Trustee in the Series 2002-3 Collateral and

     reasonably satisfactory evidence of the payment of any necessary fee or tax
     relating thereto.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          Section 6.1. INCREASED COSTS. (a) If any Change in Law (except with
respect to Taxes which shall be governed by Section 6.2) shall:

          (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
     or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
     of, or credit extended by any Affected Party; or

          (ii)   impose on any Affected Party any other condition affecting the
     Indenture or the Related Documents;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to reduce any amount received or
receivable by such Affected Party hereunder or in connection herewith (whether
principal, interest or otherwise), then AFC-II will pay to such Affected Party
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)    If any Affected Party determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Affected Party's capital or the capital of any corporation
controlling such Affected Party as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which such Affected Party or such corporation could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Affected
Party's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then
from time to time, AFC-II shall pay to such Affected Party such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for any such reduction
suffered.

          (c)    A certificate of an Affected Party setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party as specified in subsections
(a) and (b) of this Section 6.1 shall be delivered to AFC-II and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The agreements in this Section shall survive
the termination of this Supplement and the Base Indenture and the payment of all
amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.

                                      -36-
<Page>

          (d)    Failure or delay on the part of an Affected Party to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Affected Party's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that AFC-II shall
not be required to compensate any Affected Party pursuant to this Section 6.1
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the
date that such Affected Party notifies AFC-II of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Affected Party's intention to
claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          Section 6.2. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of AFC-II hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if AFC-II
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) subject to Section 6.2(c) below, the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 6.2) the
recipient receives an amount equal to the sum that it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) AFC-II shall make such deductions and (iii)
AFC-II shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law.

          (b)    In addition, AFC-II shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c)    AFC-II shall indemnify the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank,
the Funding Agent and each Program Support Provider within the later of 10 days
after written demand therefor and the Distribution Date next following such
demand for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or such Program Support
Provider on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of
AFC-II hereunder or under the Indenture (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 6.2) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority; PROVIDED that no Person shall be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 6.2(c) or entitled to receive additional amounts under the proviso
of Section 6.2(a) to the extent that the reason for such indemnification results
from the failure by such Person to comply with the provisions of Section 6.2(e)
or (g). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
AFC-II by the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or a Program
Support Provider shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Any payments made by
AFC-II pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be made solely from funds available in
the Series 2002-3 Distribution Account for the payment of Article VI Costs,
shall be non-recourse other than with respect to such funds, and shall not
constitute a claim against AFC-II to the extent that insufficient funds exist to
make such payment. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination
of this Supplement and the Base Indenture and the payment of all amounts payable
hereunder and thereunder.

          (d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes by AFC-II to a Governmental Authority, AFC-II shall deliver to
the CP Conduit

                                      -37-
<Page>

Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent and each applicable Program Support
Provider the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting
such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the CP
Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent and such Program Support
Provider.

          (e)    Any of the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding
Agent and any Program Support Provider if entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax with respect to payments made
hereunder or under the Indenture shall (to the extent legally able to do so)
deliver to AFC-II such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed
by applicable law and reasonably requested by AFC-II on the later of (i) 30
Business Days after such request is made and the applicable forms are provided
to such Person or (ii) 30 Business Days before prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or with an exemption
from or reduction of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.

          (f)    If any of the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding
Agent or any Program Support Provider receives a refund solely in respect of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, it shall pay over such refund to AFC-II to the
extent that it has already received indemnity payments or additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 6.2 with respect to such Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes giving rise to the refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses and without
interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AFC-II shall, upon request of
the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program
Support Provider, repay such refund (plus interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank,
the Funding Agent or any such Program Support Provider if the CP Conduit
Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program Support Provider
is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing
contained herein shall require any of the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank,
the Funding Agent or any Program Support Provider to make its tax returns (or
any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential)
available to AFC-II or any other Person.

          (g)    The CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent and
each Program Support Provider (other than any such Person which is a domestic
corporation) shall:

          (i)    upon or prior to becoming a party hereto, deliver to AFC-II two
     (2) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-9, or successor
     applicable forms, as the case may be, establishing a complete exemption
     from withholding of United States federal income taxes or backup
     withholding taxes with respect to payments under the Series 2002-3 Notes
     and this Supplement;

          (ii)   deliver to AFC-II two (2) further copies of any such form or
     certification establishing a complete exemption from withholding of United
     States federal income taxes or backup withholding taxes with respect to
     payments under the Series 2002-3 Notes and this Supplement on or before the
     date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and
     after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent
     form previously delivered by it to AFC-II; and

                                      -38-
<Page>

          (iii)  obtain such extensions of time for filing and completing such
     forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by AFC-II;

unless, in any such case, any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred
after the Series 2002-3 Closing Date (or, if later, the date the CP Conduit
Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any Program Support Provider
becomes an indemnified party hereunder) and prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders the relevant form
inapplicable or which would prevent the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the
Funding Agent or any Program Support Provider from duly completing and
delivering the relevant form with respect to it, and the CP Conduit Purchaser,
the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any Program Support Provider so advises
AFC-II.

          (h)    If a beneficial or equity owner of the CP Conduit Purchaser,
the APA Bank, the Funding Agent and any Program Support Provider (instead of the
CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent and any such Program
Support Provider itself) is required under United States federal income tax law
or the terms of a relevant treaty to provide IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-9, or
any successor applicable forms, as the case may be, in order to claim an
exemption from withholding of United States federal income taxes or backup
withholding taxes, then each such beneficial owner or equity owner shall be
considered to be a CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or a
Program Support Provider for purposes of Section 6.2 (g).

          Section 6.3. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS. If any of the CP Conduit
Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any Program Support Provider
requests compensation under Section 6.1, or if AFC-II is required to pay any
additional amount to the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent
or such Program Support Provider or any Governmental Authority for the account
of the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program
Support Provider pursuant to Section 6.2, then, upon written notice from AFC-II,
the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or such Program
Support Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its obligations hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, which pays a price for such assignment which is acceptable to the
CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program
Support Provider and its assignee, in the judgment of the CP Conduit Purchaser,
the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program Support Provider, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Section 6.1 or 6.2, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not
subject the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the Funding Agent or any such
Program Support Provider to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, the
Funding Agent or any such Program Support Provider. AFC-II hereby agrees to pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA
Bank, the Funding Agent or any such Program Support Provider in connection with
any such designation or assignment.

          Section 6.4. BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. AFC-II agrees to indemnify each
Swing-Line Purchaser and to hold each Swing-Line Purchaser harmless from any
loss or expense which such Swing-Line Purchaser may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) the failure by AFC-II to accept any Increase after AFC-II has
given irrevocable notice requesting the same in accordance

                                      -39-
<Page>

with the provisions of this Supplement or (b) default by AFC-II in making any
prepayment in connection with a Decrease after AFC-II has given irrevocable
notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5 or (c) the
making of a Decrease on a date other than as specified in any notice of a
Decrease or in a greater amount than contained in any notice of Decrease. Such
indemnification shall include an amount determined by the Funding Agent and
shall equal the losses and expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired as a result of the failure
to accept an Increase, a default in the making of a Decrease or the making of a
Decrease in an amount or on a date not contained in a notice of a Decrease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments made by AFC-II pursuant to this
subsection shall be made solely from funds available in the Series 2002-3
Distribution Account for the payment of Article VI Costs, shall be non-recourse
other than with respect to such funds, and shall not constitute a claim against
AFC-II to the extent that such funds are insufficient to make such payment. This
covenant shall survive the termination of this Supplement and the Base Indenture
and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and thereunder. A certificate
as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence
submitted by any Funding Agent on behalf of the CP Conduit Purchaser to AFC-II
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

the CP Conduit Purchaser, the Funding Agent and the APA Banks in accordance with
the terms of this Supplement will constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of AFC-II enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other
similar laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors'
rights or by general equitable principles.

          Section 7.2. COVENANTS OF AFC-II AND THE ADMINISTRATOR. AFC-II and the
Administrator hereby agree, in addition to their obligations hereunder, that:

their respective covenants (both affirmative and negative) contained in the Base
Indenture and all other Related Documents to which each is a party;

          (b)    they shall afford the Funding Agent, the Trustee or any

prior notice (and with one Business Day's prior notice if an Amortization Event
with respect to the Series 2002-3 Notes shall have been deemed to have occurred
or shall have been declared to have occurred), for purposes of inspection and
shall permit the Funding Agent, the Trustee or any representative of the Funding
Agent or the Trustee to visit any of AFC-II's or the Administrator's, as the
case may be, offices or properties during regular business hours and as often as
may reasonably be desired to discuss the business, operations, properties,
financial and other conditions of AFC-II or the Administrator with their
respective officers and employees and with their independent certified public
accountants;

Manufacturer Programs as the Funding Agent may from time to time reasonably
request; and

          (d)    they shall provide to the Funding Agent simultaneously with
delivery to the Trustee copies of information furnished to the Trustee or AFC-II
pursuant to the Related Documents as such information relates to all Series of
Notes generally or specifically to the Series 2002-3 Notes or the Series 2002-3
Collateral.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                THE FUNDING AGENT

          Section 8.1. APPOINTMENT. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank
hereby irrevocably designates and appoints JPMorgan Chase as the agent of such
Person under this Supplement and irrevocably authorizes the Funding Agent, in
such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Supplement and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to the Funding Agent by the terms of this Supplement, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Supplement, the Funding Agent shall
not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein,
or any fiduciary relationship with the CP Conduit Purchaser or the APA Bank and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Supplement or otherwise exist against the
Funding Agent.

          Section 8.2. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Funding Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Supplement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact
and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Funding Agent shall not be responsible to the CP Conduit
Purchaser or the APA Bank for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

                                      -41-
<Page>

          Section 8.3. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. The Funding Agent and any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall
not be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or
such Person under or in connection with the Base Indenture, this Supplement or
any other Related Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are
found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to the CP Conduit Purchaser and/or
the APA Bank for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor, the Administrator, or any
officer thereof contained in this Supplement or any other Related Document or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Funding Agent under or in connection with, this
Supplement or any other Related Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Supplement,
any other Related Document, or for any failure of any of AFC-II, the Lessors,
the Lessees, the Guarantor, or the Administrator to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. The Funding Agent shall not be under any obligation to
the CP Conduit Purchaser or the APA Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Supplement, any other Related Document or to inspect the properties,
books or records of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor, or the
Administrator.

          Section 8.4. RELIANCE BY THE FUNDING AGENT. The Funding Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,
without limitation, counsel to AFC-II or the Administrator), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Funding Agent. The Funding Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Supplement or any other Related Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Swing-Line Purchaser, as it deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Swing-Line Purchaser
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.

          Section 8.5. NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATOR DEFAULT OR AMORTIZATION EVENT OR
POTENTIAL AMORTIZATION EVENT. The Funding Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Amortization Event or Potential
Amortization Event or any Administrator Default unless the Funding Agent has
received written notice from the CP Conduit Purchaser, the APA Bank, AFC-II or
the Administrator referring to the Indenture or this Supplement, describing such
Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event, or Administrator Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of an Amortization Event or Potential
Amortization Event" or "notice of an Administrator Default," as the case may be.
In the event that the Funding Agent receives such a notice, the Funding Agent
shall give notice thereof to the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank. The
Funding Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as shall be
reasonably directed by the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank, PROVIDED that
unless and until the Funding Agent shall have received such directions, the
Funding Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such

                                      -42-
<Page>

action, with respect to such event as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank.

          Section 8.6. NON-RELIANCE ON THE FUNDING AGENT, THE CP CONDUIT
PURCHASER AND THE APA BANK. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank expressly
acknowledge that neither the Funding Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by the Funding Agent hereinafter taken,
including any review of the affairs of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, or the Administrator shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by the Funding Agent to any such Person. Each of the CP Conduit
Purchaser and the APA Bank represents to the Funding Agent that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Funding Agent and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal
of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the
Guarantor, and the Administrator and made its own decision to enter into this
Supplement. Each of the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Funding Agent and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Supplement and the other Related
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself
as to the business, operations, property, financial and other conditions and
creditworthiness of AFC-II, the Lessors, the Lessees, the Guarantor, and the
Administrator.

          Section 8.7. INDEMNIFICATION. The APA Bank agrees to indemnify the
Funding Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by AFC-II
and the Administrator and without limiting the obligation of AFC-II and the
Administrator to do so) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Funding Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of this Supplement, any of the other Related Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Funding
Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that the APA
Bank shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Funding Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the payment of all amounts payable hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                     GENERAL

          Section 9.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) This Supplement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that AFC-II may not assign or transfer any of its
rights under this Supplement without the prior written consent of all of the
Series 2002-3 Noteholders, the CP Conduit Purchaser may assign or transfer any
of its rights under this Supplement other than in accordance with the Asset
Purchase

                                      -43-
<Page>

Agreement or otherwise to the APA Bank or a Program Support Provider with
respect to such CP Conduit Purchaser or pursuant to clause (b) and the APA Bank
may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Supplement except to a Program Support Provider or pursuant to clause (c), (d)
or (e) below of this Section 9.1.

          (b)    Without limiting the foregoing, the CP Conduit Purchaser may
assign all or a portion of the Series 2002-3 Invested Amount and its rights and
obligations under this Supplement and any other Related Documents to which it is
a party to a Conduit Assignee. Prior to or concurrently with the effectiveness
of any such assignment (or if impracticable, immediately thereafter), the CP
Conduit Purchaser shall notify AFC-II, the Trustee and the Administrator
thereof. Upon such assignment by the CP Conduit Purchaser to a Conduit Assignee,
(A) such Conduit Assignee shall be the owner of the Series 2002-3 Invested
Amount or such portion thereof, (B) the related administrative or managing agent
for such Conduit Assignee will act as the administrative agent for such Conduit
Assignee hereunder, with all corresponding rights and powers, express or
implied, granted to the Funding Agent hereunder or under the other Related
Documents, (C) such Conduit Assignee and its liquidity support provider(s) and
credit support provider(s) and other related parties shall have the benefit of
all the rights and protections provided to the CP Conduit Purchaser herein and
in the other Related Documents (including, without limitation, any limitation on
recourse against the Conduit Assignee as provided in this paragraph), (D) such
Conduit Assignee shall assume all of the CP Conduit Purchaser's obligations, if
any, hereunder or under the Base Indenture or under any other Related Document
with respect to such portion of the Series 2002-3 Invested Amount and the CP
Conduit Purchaser shall be released from such obligations, (E) all distributions
in respect of the Series 2002-3 Invested Amount or such portion thereof with
respect to the CP Conduit Purchaser shall be made to the applicable agent or
administrative agent, as applicable, on behalf of such Conduit Assignee, (F) the
definitions of the terms "Monthly Funding Costs" and "Discount" shall be
determined in the manner set forth in the definition of "Monthly Funding Costs"
and "Discount" applicable to the CP Conduit Purchaser on the basis of the
interest rate or discount applicable to commercial paper issued by such Conduit
Assignee (rather than the CP Conduit Purchaser), (G) the defined terms and other
terms and provisions of this Supplement, the Base Indenture and the other
Related Documents shall be interpreted in accordance with the foregoing, and (H)
if requested by the Administrator or the agent or administrative agent with
respect to the Conduit Assignee, the parties will execute and deliver such
further agreements and documents and take such other actions as the
Administrator or such agent or administrative agent may reasonably request to
evidence and give effect to the foregoing. No assignment by the CP Conduit
Purchaser to a Conduit Assignee of the Series 2002-3 Invested Amount with
respect to the CP Conduit Purchaser shall in any way diminish the obligations of
the APA Bank with respect to the CP Conduit Purchaser under Section 2.3 to fund
any Increase.

          (c)    Any APA Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell all of its rights and
obligations under this Supplement and the Series 2002-3 Notes, with the prior
written consent of AFC-II and the Administrator (in each case, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), to another bank (an "ACQUIRING APA BANK")
pursuant to a transfer supplement, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C (the
"TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT"), executed by such Acquiring APA Bank, the APA Bank, the
Funding Agent, AFC-II and the Administrator and delivered to the Administrator.
Notwithstanding the

                                      -44-
<Page>

foregoing, the APA Bank shall not sell its rights hereunder if such Acquiring
APA Bank is not an Eligible Assignee.

          (d)    The APA Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more financial
institutions or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participations in the Commitment
Amount, its Series 2002-3 Note and its rights hereunder pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the APA Bank and the
Participant; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) in the event of any such sale by the
APA Bank to a Participant, (A) the APA Bank's obligations under this Supplement
shall remain unchanged, (B) the APA Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof and (C) AFC-II shall continue to deal solely and directly
with the APA Bank in connection with its rights and obligations under this
Supplement and (ii) the APA Bank shall not sell any participating interest under
which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or any
consent or waiver with respect to, this Supplement, the Base Indenture or any
Related Document. A Participant shall have the right to receive Article VI Costs
but only to the extent that the APA Bank would have had such right absent the
sale of the related participation and, with respect to amounts due pursuant to
Section 6.2, only to the extent such Participant shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 6.2(e) and (g) as if such Participant were the APA Bank.

          (e)    AFC-II authorizes each APA Bank to disclose to any Participant
or Acquiring APA Bank (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such APA Bank's possession concerning AFC-II,
the Collateral, the Administrator and the Related Documents which has been
delivered to such APA Bank by AFC-II or the Administrator in connection with
such APA Bank's credit evaluation of AFC-II, the Collateral and the
Administrator.

          Section 9.2. SECURITIES LAW. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank
hereby represents and warrants to AFC-II that it is an "accredited investor" as
such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and
has sufficient assets to bear the economic risk of, and sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks
of, its investment in a Series 2002-3 Note. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA
Bank agrees that its Series 2002-3 Note will be acquired for investment only and
not with a view to any public distribution thereof, and that the CP Conduit
Purchaser and the APA Bank will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of its
Series 2002-3 Note (or any interest therein) in violation of any of the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, or any applicable state or
other securities laws. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank acknowledges
that it has no right to require AFC-II to register its Series 2002-3 Note under
the Securities Act or any other securities law. The CP Conduit Purchaser and the
APA Bank hereby confirms and agrees that in connection with any transfer by it
of an interest in the Series 2002-3 Note, the CP Conduit Purchaser or the APA
Bank has not engaged and will not engage in a general solicitation or general
advertising including advertisements, articles, notices or other communications
published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over radio or
television, or any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any
general solicitation or general advertising.

          Section 9.3. NO BANKRUPTCY PETITION. (a) Each of the CP Conduit
Purchaser, the APA Bank and the Funding Agent hereby covenants and agrees that,
prior to the date which is

                                      -45-
<Page>

one year and one day after the later of payment in full of all Series of Notes,
it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against,
AFC-II any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings, or other similar proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy
or similar law.

          (b)    AFC-II, the Trustee, the Funding Agent and the APA Bank hereby
covenants and agrees that, prior to the date which is one year and one day after
the payment in full of all outstanding Commercial Paper issued by, or for the
benefit of, the CP Conduit Purchaser, it will not institute against, or join any
other Person in instituting against, the CP Conduit Purchaser (or the Person
issuing Commercial Paper for the benefit of the CP Conduit Purchaser) any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings,
or other similar proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar
law.

          (c)    This covenant shall survive the termination of this Supplement
and the Base Indenture and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and
thereunder.

          Section 9.4. LIMITED RECOURSE. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any obligations of the CP Conduit Purchaser hereunder
to any party hereto are solely the corporate obligations of the CP Conduit
Purchaser and shall be payable at such time as funds are received by or are
available to the CP Conduit Purchaser in excess of funds necessary to pay in
full all of its outstanding Commercial Paper and, to the extent funds are not
available to pay such obligations, the claims relating thereto shall not
constitute a claim against the CP Conduit Purchaser but shall continue to
accrue. Each party hereto agrees that the payment of any claim (as defined in
Section 101 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) of any such party against the CP
Conduit Purchaser shall be subordinated to the payment in full of all of its
Commercial Paper.

          (b)    No recourse under any obligation, covenant or agreement of the
CP Conduit Purchaser contained herein shall be had against any incorporator,
stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent of the CP Conduit Purchaser,
its administrative agent, the Funding Agent or any of their Affiliates by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that this
Supplement is solely a corporate obligation of the CP Conduit Purchaser
individually, and that no personal liability whatever shall attach to or be
incurred by any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, employee or agent
of the CP Conduit Purchaser, its administrative agent, the Funding Agent or any
of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) or any of them under or by
reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements of the CP Conduit
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or implied therefrom, and that any and
all personal liability for breaches by the CP Conduit Purchaser of any of such
obligations, covenants or agreements, either at common law or at equity, or by
statute, rule or regulation, of every such incorporator, stockholder, officer,
director, employee or agent is hereby expressly waived as a condition of and in
consideration for the execution of this Supplement; PROVIDED that the foregoing
shall not relieve any such Person from any liability it might otherwise have as
a result of fraudulent actions taken or omissions made by them. The provisions
of this Section 9.4 shall survive termination of this Supplement.

          Section 9.15. COLLATERAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AFC-II.
AFC-II hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee, the Funding Agent, the APA
Bank and the CP Conduit Purchaser that:

          (a)    The Base Indenture creates a valid and continuing security
     interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Collateral in favor of
     the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, which security interest is
     prior to all other liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors
     of and purchasers from AFC-II. This Supplement will create a valid and
     continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the
     Series 2002-3 Collateral in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the
     Series 2002-3 Noteholders, which security interest is prior to all other
     liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and purchasers
     from AFC-II.

          (b)    The Collateral and the Series 2002-3 Collateral (in each case,
     other than the Vehicles) consist of "instruments", "general intangibles"
     and "deposit accounts" within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

          (c)    AFC-II owns and has good and marketable title to the Collateral
     and the Series 2002-3 Collateral free and clear of any lien, claim or
     encumbrance of any Person.

          (d)    With respect to the portion of the Collateral that consists of
     instruments, all original executed copies of each instrument that
     constitute or evidence part of the Collateral have been delivered to the
     Trustee. None of the instruments that constitute or evidence the Collateral
     have any marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged,
     assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Trustee.

          (e)    With respect to the portion of the Collateral that consists of
     general intangibles, AFC-II has caused the filing of all appropriate
     financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
     jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
     interest in the Collateral granted to the Trustee under the Base Indenture.

                                      -48-
<Page>

          (f)    With respect to the portion of the Collateral and the Series
     2002-3 Collateral that consists of deposit or securities accounts
     maintained with a bank other than the Trustee (collectively, the "BANK
     ACCOUNTS"), AFC-II has delivered to the Trustee a fully executed agreement
     pursuant to which the bank maintaining the Bank Accounts has agreed to
     comply with all instructions originated by the Trustee directing
     disposition of the funds in the Bank Accounts without further consent by
     AFC-II. The Bank Accounts are not in the name of any person other than
     AFC-II or the Trustee. AFC-II has not consented to the bank maintaining the
     Bank Accounts to comply with instructions of any person other than the
     Trustee.

          (g)    Other than the security interest granted to the Trustee under
     the Base Indenture and this Supplement, AFC-II has not pledged, assigned,
     sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
     Collateral or the Series 2002-3 Collateral. AFC-II has not authorized the
     filing of and is not aware of any financing statements against AFC-II that
     includes a description of collateral covering the Collateral other than any
     financing statement under the Base Indenture or that has been terminated.
     AFC-II is not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings against AFC-II.

          (h)    AFC-II has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
financing statements against AFC-II that include a description of collateral
covering the Collateral other than any financing statements (i) relating to the
security interest granted to the Trustee in the Base Indenture or (ii) that has
been terminated.

          Section 9.16. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the CP Conduit
Purchaser or the APA Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exhaustive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

          Section 9.17. WAIVER OF SETOFF. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Supplement or any other agreement to the contrary, all payments to the
Funding Agent, the CP Conduit Purchaser and the APA Bank hereunder shall be made
without set-off or counterclaim.

          Section 9.18. NOTICES. All notices, requests, instructions and demands
to or upon any party hereto to be effective shall be given (i) in the case of
