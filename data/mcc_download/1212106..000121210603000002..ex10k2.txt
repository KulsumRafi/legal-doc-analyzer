Report of Independent Accountants

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Sovereign Bank

We have examined management's assertion, included in the
accompanying report titled Report of Management, that Sovereign
Bank (Sovereign) complied with the minimum servicing standards
set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP)
during the year ended December 31, 2002. Management is
responsible for Sovereign's compliance with those requirements.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertions about Sovereign's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence about Sovereign's compliance with those
requirements and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on Sovereign's
compliance with specified requirements.

In our opinion, management's assertion, that Sovereign complied
with the aforementioned requirements during the year ended
December 31, 2002, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the
audit committee, management, U.S. Bank National Association,
and Citibank, N.A. and is not intended to be and should not be
used by anyone other than these specified parties.
