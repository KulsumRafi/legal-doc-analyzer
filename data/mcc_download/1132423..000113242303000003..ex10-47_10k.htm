The Company shall pay Executive a base salary (the "<U>Base Salary</U>") at the annual rate of $175,500, provided that if the LTM Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter during 2003 or 2004 (such day, the "Salary Reimbursement Date") equals $116 million or more, the Base Salary shall be payable at the annual rate of $195,000 from and after the Salary Reimbursement Date, and the Company shall pay to Executive 13.89% of the amount paid to Executive as Base Salary from January 1, 2003 to the Salary Reimbursement Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, on January 1, 2004, Executive's Base Salary shall be payable at the annual rate of $195,000.

The Bonus shall be based on the Company's achievement of certain operating and/or financial goals to be established by the Compensation Committee, with an annual target bonus amount equal to 35% of Executive's highest Base Salary during the term of Executive's employment under this Agreement.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;<U>Benefits</U>.  During the term of employment hereunder, the Company shall provide to Executive coverage under any standard employee benefit programs, plans and practices, in accordance with the terms that the Company makes generally available to its executive officers; <U>provided</U>, however, that the Company shall pay Executive $15,000 each year until such time as the Company has a 401(k) match program that Executive can participate in on an equivalent vested basis.

If Executive elects to receive any matching contributions from the Company in connection with the Company's 401(k) program, then the above-described $15,000 annual payment will be reduced by the amount of the Company's annual match."</P>
