                            CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

         Section 2.1       Purchase and Sale of Receivables.

         (a) On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell to the Issuer, and the Issuer agrees to
purchase from the Seller, all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and
to the Receivables and all proceeds thereof received after the Cutoff Date. The
conveyance to the Issuer of the Receivables and all proceeds thereof is intended
as a sale free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens in favor of the Issuer
or the Trustee created pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Documents) and
it is intended that the Receivables and such proceeds shall not be part of the
Seller's estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or
against the Seller under any bankruptcy or similar law. If, however,
notwithstanding the express intent of the parties hereto, such conveyance is
considered to be a secured financing or loan, the Seller hereby grants to the
Issuer a first priority security interest in all of the Seller's right, title
and interest in and to such Receivables and all proceeds thereof to secure all
of the Seller's obligations hereunder, and this Agreement constitutes a security
agreement.

transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Issuer, without recourse (subject
to the obligations herein), all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and
to: the Receivables, all monies and other proceeds with respect thereto after
the Cutoff Date and the proceeds of any and all of the foregoing.

         (c) Receivables Purchase Price. In consideration for the Receivables
described in Section 2.1(b), the Issuer shall, on the Closing Date, (i) pay to
the Seller (or at the Seller's direction) an amount equal to $330,966,577 in
cash by federal wire transfer (same day) funds and (ii) assign and endorse over
to the Seller certain promissory notes, which in the aggregate, have a principal
face amount equal to $37,350,000.

         (d) The Closing. The sale and purchase of the Receivables shall take
place at a closing at the offices of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, 222
North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60601 on the Closing Date,
simultaneously with the closing under the Indenture pursuant to which the Issuer
shall (i) grant all of its right, title and interest in and to the Receivables
and the proceeds thereof to the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and
(ii) issue the Notes.

         Section 2.2       Custody of Receivable Files.

         (a) In connection with the sale, transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Issuer hereby directs the Trustee
to, and the Trustee hereby does, revocably appoint CBC (in its capacity as the
Servicer) to act as Custodian, and CBC hereby accepts such appointment, to act
as the agent of the Trustee as custodian of the following documents and/or
instruments in its possession which shall be delivered to the Custodian as agent
of the Trustee on or prior to the Closing Date (with respect to each
Receivable):

                  (i) The original contract governing payment in respect of such
         Receivable, or a copy thereof, between each Obligor and the Seller or
         any of its identified current or former officers, employees or members,
         together with any written agreements amending, modifying or waiving the
         terms of such contract prior to the Closing Date, the written consent
         to the assignment by the Seller to the Issuer executed by the related
         Obligor, copies of each insurance policy related to such Receivable and
         an Assignment executed by the Seller (and consented to by the related
         Obligor) conveying all of its right, title and interest in and to such
         Receivable and the proceeds thereof (the "Receivables Files").

         The Servicer shall, following the occurrence of a Servicer Termination
Event, automatically cease to act as Custodian with respect to the foregoing

amounts received which are required to be deposited in the Collection Account
have been so deposited) and shall request delivery of the Receivable Files to

enforcing the terms of the contract related to such Receivable, the Custodian
shall, upon written request of an Executive Officer of the Servicer, cause the
related Receivables File to be released to the Servicer. The Servicer's receipt
of a Receivables File shall obligate the Servicer to return such Receivables
File to the Custodian when its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the
Receivable is repurchased as described in Section 2.5 or 3.4, or has been
terminated due to surrender, exchange, or mortality of the insured or paid in
full.

Receivables, on which the Issuer relies in accepting the Receivables and in
executing and issuing the Notes and upon which the Trustee has relied in

and to conduct its business as such properties are currently owned and such

place of business, its chief executive office) is 300 North Greene Street, Suite
2050, Greensboro, North Carolina 27401 and it has not changed its location (as
such term is used in the UCC) for the four months preceding the Closing Date or
its place of business (or if it has more than one place of business, its chief
executive office) for the six years prior to the Closing Date.

         (j) Legal Name. Its legal name is exactly as set forth in this
Agreement, it has not changed its name during the six years prior to the Closing
Date and it does not have any trade names, fictitious names, assumed names or
"doing business" names.

         (k) Solvency. It is solvent and will not become insolvent after giving

         Section 2.5 Repurchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Certain
Representations and Warranties.

         (a) Upon discovery by any of the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee or
the Issuer of a breach of any of the representations and warranties of the
Seller contained in Section 2.4(a), the party discovering such breach or failure
shall give prompt written notice to the other parties hereto; provided, however,
that the failure to give any such notice shall not affect any obligation of the
Seller under this Section 2.5. As of the last day of the last calendar month of
each Quarterly Period in which a Responsible Officer of the Seller has actual
knowledge or notice of such breach or failure which materially and adversely
affects the interests of the Noteholders in any Receivable, the Seller shall,
unless such breach or failure shall have been cured in all material respects,
repurchase from the Issuer each Receivable materially and adversely affected by
such breach and, on or before the related Deposit Date, pay the Purchase Amount
to the Collection Account. Upon knowledge of the Trustee that the Seller has
failed to effect its repurchase obligation, the Trustee for the benefit of the
Noteholders shall enforce directly the obligation of the Seller to repurchase
such Receivables. The obligation of the Seller to repurchase any Receivable with
respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, if such
obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the Seller for such
breach available to the Noteholders, the Issuer or the Trustee on behalf of
Noteholders; provided, however, that the Seller shall indemnify the Issuer, the
Backup Servicer, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee and the Noteholders against
all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or
incurred by any of them as a result of third party claims arising out of the
events or facts giving rise to such breach except to the extent arising out of
or resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking
indemnification.

                                       22
<PAGE>

         (b) In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding whether the
related Receivable shall have been repurchased by the Seller, the Seller shall
indemnify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser, the Backup Servicer,
and the Noteholders against all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and
liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which may be
asserted against or incurred by any of them as a result of third party claims
arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such breach except to the
extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
seeking indemnification; provided, however, that the Seller shall have the right
to participate in any litigation for which it must so indemnify a party.

         Section 2.6 Issuer's Assignment of Administrative Receivables and
Warranty Receivables. With respect to all Administrative Receivables and all
Warranty Receivables purchased by the Servicer or repurchased by the Seller, the
Issuer shall take any and all actions reasonably requested by the Servicer or
the Seller, at the expense of the requesting party, to assign, without recourse,
representation or warranty, to the Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, all
the Issuer's right, title and interest in and to such Purchased Receivable being
an assignment outright and not for security; and the Servicer or the Seller, as
applicable, shall thereupon own such Receivable free of any further obligation
to the Issuer, the Trustee or the Noteholders with respect thereto.

         Section 2.7       Protection of Right, Title and Interest.

         (a) Filings. The Seller shall cause all financing statements and
continuation statements and any other necessary documents covering the right,
title and interest of the Issuer in and to the Receivables to be promptly filed,
and at all times to be kept recorded, registered and filed, all in such manner
and in such places as may be required by law fully to preserve and protect the
right, title and interest of the Issuer hereunder to the Receivables. The Seller
shall deliver to the Issuer (with copies to the Trustee) file stamped copies of,
or filing receipts for, any financing statement or document recorded, registered
or filed as provided above, as soon as available following such recordation,
registration or filing. The Issuer shall cooperate fully with the Seller and the
Trustee in connection with the obligations set forth above, and file any
financing statements and all documents and obtain any Opinion of Counsel
reasonably requested to fulfill the intent of this Section 2.7(a). In the event
that the Seller fails to perform its obligations under this subsection, the
Issuer or the Trustee may do so at the expense of the Seller.

         (b) Name and Other Changes. (I) At least 30 days prior to the date that
the Seller intends to make any change in its name, identity or legal structure
which could render any financing statement or continuation statement filed in
accordance with subsection (a) above seriously misleading within the applicable
provisions of the UCC or any title statute, the Seller shall give the Trustee,
the Rating Agency and the Issuer written notice of its intention to effectuate
such change (such notice to include, in reasonable detail, all information
surrounding such change) and (II) no later than two days after the effective
date of such change, the Seller shall file appropriate amendments to all
previously filed financing statements or continuation statements. At least 30
days prior to the date of any change in its location (as such term is used in
the applicable UCC), the Seller shall give the Trustee, the Rating Agency and
the Issuer written

                                       23
<PAGE>

notice of its intention to effectuate such change and the Seller shall within
two days after the effective date thereof, file any such amendment or new
financing statement requested by the Issuer or the Trustee. Prior to changing
its name, identity, legal structure or location, the Seller shall deliver to the
Issuer and the Trustee, an Opinion of Counsel either (a) stating that, in the
opinion of such counsel, all financing statements and continuation statements
have been authorized and filed (or will be filed) that are necessary fully to
preserve and protect the first priority perfected security interest of the
Issuer and the Trustee in the Receivables, and reciting the details of such
filings, or (b) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, no such action is
necessary to preserve and protect such interest. The Seller shall at all times
maintain each office from which it shall service Receivables, and its principal
executive office, within the United States of America.

         (c) List of Receivables. Upon request, the Seller shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Trustee, within five (5) Business Days, a list of
all Receivables then owned by the Issuer, together with a reconciliation of such
list to the Schedule of Receivables.

         (d) Maintenance of Computer Systems. The Seller shall maintain its
computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale hereunder of the
Receivables to the Issuer, its master computer records (including any back-up
archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the interest of the
Issuer and the Trustee in such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by
the Issuer.

         Section 2.8 Restrictions on Liens. The Seller shall not (i) create,
incur or suffer to exist, or agree to create, incur or suffer to exist, or
consent to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or
otherwise) the creation, incurrence or existence of any Lien or restriction on
transferability of the Receivables, except for the ownership interest of the
Issuer and the Lien created hereby in favor of the Issuer or the Lien created by
the Indenture in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, any
Lien permitted hereunder as may be in effect on the Closing Date, and the
restrictions on transferability imposed by this Agreement and the Indenture or
(ii) authorize any filing or cause to be filed under the UCC of any jurisdiction
any financing statement which names it or the Issuer as a debtor, or sign any
security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file such
financing statement, with respect to the Receivables, except in each case any
such instrument solely evidencing the Issuer's ownership interest or securing
the rights and preserving the Lien in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of
the Noteholders and except for any such security agreement or authorization to
file a financing statement contained in or arising under the applicable UCC by
virtue of a security agreement contained in any Obligor Receivable Agreement as
in effect on the Closing Date. The Seller shall defend the right, title and

prevent the Issuer from (i) treating the Receivables being sold by CBC as being
owned by CBC solely for financial accounting purposes

                                       24

the Servicer, the Backup Servicer, the Initial Purchaser or the Noteholders
through, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller in the
performance (or failure to perform) its duties under this Agreement or the
Related Documents to the Seller is a party.

                                   ARTICLE III
                   ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES

         Section 3.1 Duties of the Servicer. (a) The Servicer is hereby
authorized to act as agent for the Issuer and in such capacity shall manage,
service, administer and make collections on the Receivables, perform or arrange
for the performance of services, and administer or arrange for the
administration of programs, in accordance with the Servicing Policy and
Procedures and in a manner consistent with the terms of service contracts and
similar arrangements between the Seller, on the one hand, and holders of
insurance policies or Obligors related to the Receivables, on the other hand,
and perform the other actions required by the Servicer under this Agreement. The
Servicer agrees that its servicing of the Receivables shall be carried out in
accordance with customary and usual procedures of institutions which service
payment streams similar to the Receivables and, to the extent more exacting, the
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises from time to time with
respect to all comparable payment streams similar to the Receivables that it
services for itself or any of its Affiliates. In performing such duties, so long
as CBC is the Servicer, it shall comply with its current Servicing Policy and
Procedures, as such Servicing Policy and Procedures may be amended from time to
time, (it being understood that the Servicer shall not amend its Servicing
Policy and Procedures in any way which would be reasonably expected to have an
adverse affect on the interests of the Noteholders). The Servicer's duties shall
include, without limitation, collection and posting of all payments, responding
to inquiries of Obligors on the Receivables, investigating delinquencies,
accounting for collections and furnishing quarterly and annual statements to the
Issuer and the Trustee with respect to distributions and performing the other
duties specified herein. To the extent consistent with the standards, policies
and procedures otherwise required hereby, the Servicer shall follow its
customary standards, policies, and procedures and shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such
managing, servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or
desirable. The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name or in
the name of the Issuer (provided the Servicer has obtained the Issuer's prior
written consent) a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable or to commence or
participate in any other legal proceeding (including, without limitation, a
bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable or an Obligor. If
the Servicer commences or participates in such a legal proceeding in its own
name, the Issuer shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such
Receivable to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in
any such proceeding as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is authorized and
empowered by the Issuer to execute and deliver in the Servicer's name any
notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents
or instruments in connection with any such proceeding. The Issuer shall furnish
the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents which the Servicer
may reasonably request and which the Servicer deems necessary or appropriate and
take any other steps which the Servicer may deem necessary or appropriate to
enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under
this Agreement.

                                       29

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not engage in any
of the following activities with respect to the Variable Policies:

                  (i) recommending any security;

                  (ii) giving any investment advice with respect to any
         security;

                  (iii) discussing the merits of any security or any type of
         security;

                  (iv) responding to any question that might require familiarity
         with the securities industry;

                  (v) receiving any compensation based on transactions in
         securities or the provision of investment advice; or

                  (vi) handling any customer funds or securities or becoming
         involved in any securities transactions other than providing clerical
         or ministerial assistance.

The Servicer shall refer all securities related questions to the Subservicer.

         Section 3.2       Collection of Receivable Payments.

         (a) Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required by
this Agreement, the Servicer shall make all reasonable efforts to collect all
payments with respect to the Receivables as and when the same shall become due,
and shall follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to all
comparable payment streams similar to the Receivables that it services for
itself or any of its Affiliates and otherwise act with respect to the
Receivables in such manner as will maximize the amount to be collected with
respect thereto.

         (b) Notwithstanding any third-party processing arrangement, or any of
the provisions of this Agreement relating to any third-party processing
arrangement, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Issuer,
Trustee and Noteholders for servicing and administering the Receivables in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without diminution of such
obligation or liability by virtue thereof.

         (c) The Servicer shall remit all payments by or on behalf of the
Obligors received directly by the Servicer to the Lock-Box Account within two
Business Days of receipt thereof.

         Section 3.3 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Servicer. The
Servicer makes the following representations, warranties and covenants on which
the Issuer relies in accepting the Receivables and issuing the Notes, on which
the Trustee relies in authenticating the Notes.

         upon payment in full of such Receivable or as otherwise contemplated
         herein;

                  (ii) No Impairment. The Servicer shall do nothing to impair
         the rights of the Issuer or the Trustee for the benefit of the
         Noteholders in the Receivables;

                  (iii) No Amendments. The Servicer shall not grant payment
         extensions or amend or modify the terms of any Receivable or any
         contract related to any Receivable; and

                  (iv) Restrictions on Liens. The Servicer shall not (i) create,
         incur or suffer to exist, or agree to create, incur or suffer to exist,
         or consent to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a
         contingency or otherwise) the creation, incurrence or existence of any
         Lien or restriction on transferability of the Receivables except for
         the Lien created hereby in favor of the Issuer or the Lien created by
         the Indenture in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the
         Noteholders, any Lien as may be in effect on the Closing Date and the
         restrictions on transferability imposed by this Agreement and the
         Indenture; provided, however, that the Servicer shall only be liable
         for any losses, costs or expenses resulting from any Lien (including
         any Lien permitted hereunder) arising from any action or omission of
         the Servicer, or (ii) authorize or file (or cause to be filed) under
         the UCC of any jurisdiction any financing statement which names the
         Seller, the Servicer or the Issuer as a debtor, or sign any security
         agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file such
         financing statement, with respect to the Receivables, except in each
         case any such instrument solely securing the rights and preserving the
         Lien of the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and except for
         any such security agreement or authorization to file a financing
         statement contained in or arising under the applicable UCC by virtue of
         a security agreement contained in any Obligor Receivable Agreement as
         in effect on the Closing Date.

         (b) CBC represents, warrants and covenants as to itself as of the
Closing Date and each successor Servicer represents, warrants and covenants as
to itself as of the date it becomes Servicer hereunder, with appropriate factual

         times, and now has, power, authority and legal right to enter into and

         Receivables or (iii) its ability to perform its obligations hereunder

         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except
         such as have been duly made, effected or obtained or are related to
         federal or state securities laws in connection with the registration or
         the sale of the Notes;

                  (viii) Information to Backup Servicer. The database and
         information furnished to the Backup Servicer hereunder concerning the
         Receivables is accurate and complete in all material respects;

                  (ix) Compensation. Its compensation as Servicer hereunder is
         consistent with that which would be payable in an arm's-length
         transaction;

                  (x) Nonconsolidation. CBC confirms that the statements
         contained under "Assumptions of Fact" in the opinion of Vedder, Price,
         Kaufman & Kammholz regarding substantive consolidation matters
         delivered to the Trustee on the Closing Date are true and correct with

         covenants and obligations were set forth herein;

                  (xi) Members of the Issuer. CBC is the sole member of the
         Issuer, and it is the registered owner of all of the membership
         interests in the Issuer; and such membership interest has been fully
         paid and is owned of record, free and clear of all mortgages,
         assignments, pledges, security interests, warrants, options and rights
         to purchase. CBC will not transfer its membership interests in the
         Issuer without the prior written consent of the Trustee, the Backup
         Servicer and the Rating Agency; provided, however, that CBC may
         transfer all of such membership interests to a wholly-owned subsidiary
         of CBC, so long as (a) such wholly-owned subsidiary covenants and
         agrees in writing with the Trustee not to transfer such membership
         interests without the prior written consent of the Trustee, the Backup
         Servicer and the Rating Agency and (b) CBC provides 30 days' prior
         written notice of such transfer to each of the Trustee, the Backup
         Servicer and the Rating Agency and prior to such transfer, CBC shall
         (I) upon request, fulfill the requirements of Section 2.7(b), and (II)
         take all such actions, including, without limitation, executing and

                                       33

         of Counsel as are reasonably requested by the Trustee, the Backup
         Servicer or the Rating Agency; and

                  (xii) Financial Statements. All audited and, to the extent
         delivered or shown to any third party, unaudited financial statements
         of CBC (or any Affiliate thereof) that are consolidated to include the
         Issuer will contain detailed notes clearly stating that the (A) all of
         the Issuer's assets (including the Receivables) are owned by the
         Issuer, and (B) the Issuer is a separate entity.

         (c) The Servicer covenants and agrees:

                  (i) Database File. The Servicer will provide the Backup
         Servicer with a magnetic tape or disk in a format acceptable to the
         Servicer and the Backup Servicer containing the database file for each
         Receivable (including, a list of complete contact information for each
         Obligor and each beneficiary under the related insurance policy) (A) as
         of the Cutoff Date, (B) thereafter, as of the last day of (I) the
         preceding Quarterly Period on each Determination Date prior to a
         Servicer Termination Event and (II) each calendar week (within one
         Business Day of such day) after the occurrence of a Servicer
         Termination Event until the actual commencement of servicing functions
         by the Backup Servicer and (C) on and as of the Business Day before the
         actual commencement of servicing functions by the Backup Servicer
         following the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event.

                  (ii) Backup Servicer Indemnification. CBC shall defend,
         indemnify and hold the Backup Servicer and any officers, directors,
         employees or agents of the Backup Servicer harmless against any and all
         claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related
         costs, judgments and any other costs, fees, and expenses that the
         Backup Servicer may sustain in connection with claims asserted at any
         time by third parties against the Backup Servicer to the extent the
         same arise out of the conduct of CBC in its capacity as the Servicer or
         the Backup Servicer's performance of its obligations as Backup Servicer
         or successor Servicer and which are not due to gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of the Backup Servicer.

         The Backup Servicer will not be responsible for delays attributable to
the Servicer's failure to deliver information, defects in the information
supplied by the Servicer or other circumstances beyond the control of the Backup
Servicer.

         The Backup Servicer, upon replacement of the Servicer, will make
arrangements with the predecessor Servicer for the prompt and safe transfer of,
and the predecessor Servicer shall provide to the Backup Servicer, all necessary
servicing files and records, including (as deemed necessary by the Backup
Servicer at such time): (i) the Receivables Files, (ii) collections history,
(iii) copies of the reconciliation statements for the Collection Account for the
Quarterly Period (or portion thereof) immediately preceding the conversion to
the Backup Servicer and (iv) the trial balances, as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding conversion to the Backup Servicer, reflecting all
applicable information.

                                       34
<PAGE>

         The Backup Servicer shall have no responsibility and shall not be in
default hereunder nor incur any liability for any failure, error, malfunction or
any delay in carrying out any of its duties under this Agreement if any such
failure or delay results from the Backup Servicer acting in accordance with
information prepared or supplied by a Person other than the Backup Servicer who
the Backup Servicer reasonably and in good faith believes to be the appropriate
Person for preparing and supplying such information or the failure of any such
Person to prepare or provide such information. The Backup Servicer shall have no
responsibility, shall not be in default and shall incur no liability (i) for any
act or failure to act by any third party, including the Servicer, the Issuer or
the Trustee or for any inaccuracy or omission in a notice or communication
received by the Backup Servicer from any third party or (ii) which is due to or
results from the invalidity, unenforceability of any Receivable with applicable
law or the breach or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made with
respect to any Receivable.

         Section 3.4 Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Covenant. Upon
discovery by the Seller, the Servicer, the Issuer or the Trustee of a breach of
any of the covenants set forth in Section 2.13 or 3.3(a), the party discovering
such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties hereto;
provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice shall not affect any
obligation of the Seller or CBC, as Servicer, under this Section 3.4. Subject to
the proviso in the second sentence of Section 8.2, as of the last day of the
Quarterly Period related to a Payment Date in which (a) a Responsible Officer of
the Servicer has actual knowledge or notice of any breach of any covenant set
forth in Section 3.3(a) which materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Noteholders in any Receivable or (b) a Responsible Officer of either the
Seller or the Servicer has actual knowledge or notice of any breach of any
covenant set forth in Section 2.13, the party in breach of any such covenant,
shall, unless such breach shall have been cured in all material respects,
purchase from the Issuer each Receivable materially and adversely affected by
such breach and, on or before the related Deposit Date, shall pay the Purchase
Amount to the Collection Account. Upon knowledge of the Trustee that such party
in breach has failed to effect its purchase obligation, the Trustee for the
benefit of the Noteholders shall enforce directly the obligation of such
breaching party to purchase such Receivables. The obligation of the Seller or
the Servicer to purchase any Receivable with respect to which such a breach has
occurred and is continuing shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute
the sole remedy against the Seller or the Servicer, as applicable, for such
breach available to the Noteholders, the Issuer or the Trustee on behalf of
Noteholders; provided, however, that CBC, as the Servicer or the Seller, as
applicable, shall indemnify the Issuer, the Backup Servicer, the Initial
Purchaser, the Trustee and the Noteholders against all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as a result of
third party claims arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such breach
except to the extent arising out of or resulting from gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.

         Section 3.5 Servicing Fee; Payment of Certain Expenses by Servicer. On
each Payment Date, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive out of the
Collection Account the Servicing Fee for the related Quarterly Period pursuant

it in connection with its activities under this Agreement

                                       35
<PAGE>

and the Related Documents to which it is a party (including taxes imposed on the
Servicer and expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports made
by the Servicer to Noteholders).

         Section 3.6 Servicer's Certificate. No later than 10:00 a.m. New York
City time on each Determination Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer,
the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee, the Backup Servicer and the Rating Agency a
Servicer's Certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer
containing among other things, (i) all information necessary to enable the
Trustee to make any withdrawal required by Section 5.2, and the distributions
required by Section 4.4, (ii) all information necessary to enable the Trustee to
send the statements to Noteholders required by and containing the information

Administrative Receivables, if any, purchased or repurchased, as the case may
be, during the related Quarterly Period, and identifying the Receivables so
purchased or repurchased, as the case may be and (iv) all information necessary
to enable the Trustee to reconcile all deposits to, and withdrawals from, the
Collection Account for the related Quarterly Period and Payment Date. Any
Receivables purchased by the Servicer or repurchased by the Seller during the
related Quarterly Period shall be identified by information similar to that as
set forth in the Schedule of Receivables.

such certificate) and of its performance under this Agreement has been made
under such officer's supervision, and (ii) to such officer's knowledge, based on

firm considered necessary in the circumstances. The Servicer shall also cause
such Independent Accountants to deliver an Accountants' Report (on any date in
December 2002 and each December thereafter) with respect to certain agreed upon
procedures and in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. In the
event such firm requires the Trustee to agree to the procedures performed by
such firm, the Servicer shall direct the Trustee in writing to so agree; it
being understood and agreed that the Trustee will deliver such letter of
agreement in conclusive reliance upon the direction of the Servicer, and the
Trustee shall not make any independent inquiry or investigation as to, and shall
have no obligation or liability in respect to, the sufficiency, validity or
correctness of such procedures. Delivery of such reports, information and
documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's
receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information

the Servicer's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder.

Trustee, the Backup Servicer and the Issuer shall and shall cause its
representatives to hold in confidence all such information. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing shall not be construed to
prohibit (i) the disclosure of any and all information that is or becomes
publicly known, or information obtained by the Trustee, any Noteholder, the
Backup Servicer, or the Issuer from sources other than the Seller, (ii)
disclosure of any and all information (A) if required to do so by any applicable

         determined by the Servicer to have resulted from mistaken deposits or
         postings or checks returned for insufficient funds or that constituted
         payment of amounts that are not Receivables. The amounts to be
         withdrawn hereunder shall be paid by the Servicer to the Person
         lawfully entitled to such amounts on the related Payment Date pursuant
         to Section 4.4(ii) upon certification by the Servicer of such amounts
         and the provision of such information to the Trustee as may be
         necessary in the opinion of the Trustee to verify the accuracy of such
         certification. In the event that the Trustee has not received such
         certification or such information satisfactory to it of the Servicer's
         right to withdraw such amounts pursuant to this Section 4.2(b), the
         Trustee shall not make a distribution to the Servicer in respect of
         such amounts pursuant to Section 4.4(ii), or if the Servicer prior
         thereto has been reimbursed pursuant to Section 4.4(ii), the Trustee
         shall withhold such amounts from amounts otherwise distributable to the
         Servicer on the next succeeding Payment Date, and

                  (ii) on or prior to each Determination Date, the Servicer may,
         but is under no obligation to, advance the amount required to be paid
         with respect to a Receivable by the Obligor thereof on or prior to such
         Determination Date, but not yet received from such Obligor (each, a
         "Servicer Advance"). The Servicer shall only make a Servicer Advance
         with respect to a Receivable, if, in good faith, it reasonably believes
         that payment in an amount equal to such Servicer Advance on such
         Receivable will be received from the Obligor thereof prior to the next
         occurring Determination Date. Each Servicer Advance

                                       41
<PAGE>

         shall be repaid to the Servicer on the next occurring Payment Date
         pursuant to Section 4.4(ii) to the extent that funds are available upon
         certification by the Servicer of such amount advanced and the provision
         of such information to the Trustee as may be necessary in the Trustee's
         opinion to verify the accuracy of such certification. In the event that
         the Trustee has not received such certification or such information
         satisfactory to it of the Servicer's entitlement to reimbursement of
         the amount of the Servicer Advance, the Trustee shall not make a
         distribution to the Servicer in respect of such amount pursuant to
         Section 4.4(ii).

         Section 4.3 Additional Deposits and Withdrawals. (a) On or before each
Deposit Date, the Servicer or the Seller shall deposit in the Collection Account
the aggregate Purchase Amounts with respect to Administrative Receivables and
Warranty Receivables, respectively, which became such during the preceding
Quarterly Period. All such deposits of Purchase Amounts shall be made in
immediately available funds. On or before each Payment Date, the Trustee shall
deposit in the Collection Account any amounts withdrawn from the Reserve Account
pursuant to Section 5.2.

         (b) No later than 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the third Business
Day of each calendar month of a Quarterly Period, the Servicer shall deliver to
the Issuer, the Trustee and the Backup Servicer, a certificate executed by a
Responsible Officer of the Servicer containing (i) all information necessary to
enable the Trustee to make any withdrawal from the Collection Account for
distribution of the Split Commissions Amount for the immediately preceding
calendar month and the aggregate amount, if any, of Additional Compensation
deposited into the Collection Account during the immediately preceding calendar
month, and (ii) all information necessary to enable the Trustee to confirm the
calculation of such Split Commissions Amount and the aggregate amount, if any,
of Additional Compensation. Not later than the second Business Day after
receiving such certificate, the Trustee shall, to the extent that funds are
available, withdraw from the Collection Account the Split Commissions Amount and
the amount of Additional Compensation, each as set forth in such certification
and distribute such amounts to the Persons entitled to receive any such amount
as set forth in such certification.

         Section 4.4 Distributions. On each Payment Date, the Trustee shall

         application of such remaining Amount Available);

                  (x) tenth, from the remaining Amount Available to the Reserve
         Account, an amount, if any, necessary to make the amount on deposit in

         giving effect to all withdrawals from the Reserve Account on such date)
         equal to the Reserve Account Required Amount;

         Section 5.2 Withdrawals from Reserve Account. If the Servicer's

of the Net Available Funds with respect to such Determination Date is less than
the sum of the amounts payable on the related Payment Date pursuant to clauses

Draw Amount"), then the Servicer's Certificate also shall specify the Reserve
Account Draw Amount, and the Trustee shall withdraw from the Reserve Account

funds available therein) on or prior to the related Payment Date in accordance
with the Servicer's Certificate. The amounts withdrawn by the Trustee from the

                                   ARTICLE VI
                              SERVICER AS CUSTODIAN

         Section 6.1       Duties of Servicer as Custodian.

         (a) Safekeeping. The Servicer, in its capacity as Custodian, shall hold
(or have agents hold on behalf of the Servicer) the Receivable Files on behalf
of the Trustee. In performing its duties as Custodian hereunder, the Custodian
shall act with reasonable care, exercising the degree of skill and care that the
Custodian exercises with respect to similar documents and that is consistent
with industry standards. The Custodian shall implement such policies and
procedures in writing with respect to the handling and custody of the Receivable
Files, so that the integrity and physical possession of the Receivable Files
shall be maintained, and, in general, shall attend to all details in connection
with maintaining custody of the Receivable Files as agent of the Trustee. The
Custodian shall maintain the Receivable Files in such a manner as shall enable
the Trustee to verify, if the Trustee so elects, the accuracy of the
recordkeeping of the Custodian. The Custodian shall promptly report to the
Trustee any failure on its part to hold the Receivable Files and shall promptly
take appropriate action to remedy any such failure.

         (b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. CBC (if it is the Custodian)
shall maintain each Receivables File at 300 North Greene Street, Suite 2050,
Greensboro, North Carolina 27401 or at such other office of CBC within the State
of North Carolina (or, in the case of any successor Servicer, within the State
in which its principal place of business is located) as shall be specified to
the Trustee by 30 days' prior written notice. The Custodian shall make available
to the Trustee (or, when requested in writing by the Trustee, to its attorneys
or auditors) the Receivables Files at such times during the normal operating
hours as the Trustee shall reasonably instruct.

         (c) Release of Documents. Upon written instructions from the Servicer,
the Custodian shall release or cause to be released any Receivables File to the
Servicer, the Servicer's agent, or the Servicer's designee, as the case may be,
at such place or places as the Servicer may designate, as soon thereafter as is
practicable, but in all cases only for the purpose of permitting the Servicer to
service the Receivables in accordance with this Agreement and the Servicing
Policy and Procedures or if the benefit under the insurance policy related to
the Receivable has been terminated, satisfied, surrendered, exchanged, or paid
in full. Any Receivables File so released shall be handled by the Servicer with
due care and returned to the Custodian for safekeeping as soon as the Servicer
or its agent or designee, as the case may be,

                                       46
<PAGE>

shall have no further need therefor. The Custodian shall not be responsible for
any loss occasioned by the failure of the Servicer, its agent or its designee to
return any documents or any delay in doing so.

         (d) Title to Receivables Files. The Custodian agrees that, in respect
of any Receivables File held as custodian hereunder, the Custodian will not at
any time have or in any way attempt to assert any interest in such Receivables
File, other than solely for the purpose of collecting the related Receivable for
the benefit of the Issuer and the Trustee and that the entire equitable interest
in such Receivable and the related Receivables File shall at all times be vested
in the Issuer and the Secured Parties.

         Section 6.2 Instructions; Authority to Act. The Custodian shall be
deemed to have received proper instructions with respect to the Receivables File
upon its receipt of written instructions signed by the Trustee. A certificate of
authority and incumbency executed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Trustee shall constitute conclusive evidence of the authority of any signatory
to act and shall be considered in full force and effect until receipt by the
Custodian of written notice to the contrary given by the Trustee.

         Section 6.3 Custodian's Indemnification. The Custodian (other than the
Trustee) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee, its officers, directors,
employees and agents and the Noteholders from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or
expenses (including reasonable legal fees if any) of any kind whatsoever that
may be imposed on, incurred, or asserted against the Trustee or the Noteholders
as the result of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Custodian
relating to the maintenance and custody of the Receivables File; provided,
however, that the Custodian shall not be liable hereunder to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory
damages, payments, costs or expenses result from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Trustee.

         Section 6.4 Effective Period and Termination. The Servicer's
appointment as Custodian shall become effective as of the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect until terminated pursuant to this Section 6.4
or until this Agreement shall be terminated. The Custodian may perform its
duties through one or more agents, which agents may maintain physical possession
of Receivables Files as agent for the Custodian acting as custodian but no such
arrangement shall relieve the Custodian of its obligations as custodian
hereunder. If CBC shall resign as Servicer, the appointment of the Custodian
hereunder may be terminated in the same manner as the rights and obligations of
the Servicer may be terminated under Section 8.2. Promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) after any termination of such appointment, the
Custodian shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Receivables Files to the
Trustee, the Trustee's agent or the Trustee's designee at such place or places
as the Trustee (with the consent of the Note Voting Amount) may reasonably
designate.

         Section 7.1       Liability of Servicer; Indemnities.

         (a) The Servicer (in its capacity as such and, in the case of CBC,
without limitation of its obligations hereunder in its individual capacity)
shall be liable hereunder only to the extent of the obligations in this
Agreement specifically undertaken by the Servicer and the representations,
warranties and covenants made by the Servicer.

         (b) The Servicer (if CBC is the Servicer) shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Issuer, the Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Initial
Purchaser, their respective officers, directors, agents and employees and the
Noteholders from and against any taxes that may at any time be asserted against
any of such parties with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any sales, gross receipts, tangible or
intangible personal property, privilege or license taxes and costs and expenses
in defending against the same.

         (c) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer,
the Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Initial Purchaser, their respective
officers, directors, agents and employees and the Noteholders from and against
any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages, and liabilities to the
extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage, or liability arose out of,
or was imposed upon the Issuer, the Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Initial
Purchaser or the Noteholders by reason of the breach of this Agreement by the
Servicer (except as provided in Section 3.3), the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Servicer in the performance or failure to perform any of its
duties or obligations under this Agreement.

         (d) Indemnification under this Article shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall include, without limitation, reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the Servicer has made any
indemnity payments pursuant to this Article and the recipient thereafter
collects any of such amounts from others, the recipient shall promptly repay
such amounts collected to the Servicer, without interest.


         (e) Notwithstanding the indemnity provisions contained in Sections
7.1(b)-(d) above, the Servicer shall not be required to indemnify the Issuer,
the Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Initial Purchaser, the Noteholders or
their respective officers, directors, agents or employees against any tax,
costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims or liabilities to the extent the same
shall be due to (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such party, or
(ii) recourse for uncollectible or uncollected Receivables (unless such failure
to collect was a result of the Servicer's breach of its representations or
warranties or obligations hereunder).

         Section 7.2 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the
Obligations of the Servicer or Backup Servicer.

                                       48

         (a) The Servicer shall not merge or consolidate with any other person,
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets as an entity to
another Person, or permit any other Person to become the successor to the
Servicer's business unless, after the merger, consolidation, conveyance,
transfer, lease or succession, the successor or surviving entity shall be
capable of fulfilling the duties of the Servicer contained in this Agreement,

(vi) of the definition thereof). Any legal entity (i) into which the Servicer

is executed, shall be the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement without
the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties to this Agreement, anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that (A) nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to release the Servicer from any obligation under the Related Documents
and (B) Servicer shall provide 30 days prior written notice of any merger,
consolidation or succession pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) to the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Noteholders and the Rating Agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Servicer shall not merge or consolidate with any other Person or permit any
other Person to become a successor to the Servicer's business, unless (x)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no representation, warranty
or covenant made pursuant to Section 3.3 shall have been breached (for purposes
hereof, such representations and warranties shall speak as of the date of the
consummation of such transaction) and (y) the Servicer shall have delivered to
the Issuer and the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
each stating that such consolidation, merger or succession and such agreement of
assumption comply with this Section 7.2(a) and that all conditions precedent, if
any, provided for in this Agreement relating to such transaction have been
complied with, and (z) the Servicer shall have delivered to the Issuer and the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, stating in the opinion of such counsel, either
(A) all financing statements and continuation statements and amendments thereto
have been authorized and filed that are necessary to preserve and protect the
security interest of the Issuer and the Trustee in the Receivables and reciting
the details of the filings or (B) no such action shall be necessary to preserve
and protect such interest.

or lease substantially all of the assets of the Backup Servicer, or (iv)
succeeding to the business of the Backup Servicer, in any of the foregoing cases
shall execute an agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the
Backup Servicer under this Agreement and, whether or not such agreement of
assumption is executed, shall be the successor to the Backup Servicer under this
Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the parties to this Agreement, anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to release the Backup Servicer from any obligation hereunder.

         Section 7.3 Limitation on Liability of Servicer, Backup Servicer and
Others.

         (a) None of the Servicer, the Backup Servicer or any of the directors
or officers or employees or agents of the Servicer or the Backup Servicer shall
be under any liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders, except as provided in
this Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any
action pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that this provision shall
not protect the Servicer, the Backup Servicer or any such person against any
liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of a breach of this
Agreement or willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of
duties; provided, further, that this provision shall not affect any liability to
indemnify the Issuer and the Trustee for costs, taxes, expenses, claims,
liabilities, losses or damages paid by the Issuer or the Trustee, each in its
individual capacity. The Servicer, the Backup Servicer and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Servicer or the Backup Servicer may rely in
good faith on the written advice of counsel or on any document of any kind prima
facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising under this Agreement.

         (b) The Backup Servicer shall not be liable for any obligation of the
Servicer contained in this Agreement, and the Issuer, the Trustee and the
Noteholders shall look only to the Servicer to perform such obligations.

         (c) The parties expressly acknowledge and consent to BNY Asset
Solutions LLC acting in the capacity of Backup Servicer or successor Servicer.
BNY Midwest Trust Company, as Trustee, and BNY Asset Solutions LLC, as Backup
Servicer may, in their respective capacities, discharge their functions fully,
without hindrance or regard to conflict of interest principles, duty of loyalty
principles or other breach of fiduciary duties to the extent that any such
conflict or breach arises from its respective performance of express duties set
forth in this Agreement in such respective capacities, all of which defenses,
claims or assertions are hereby expressly waived by the other parties hereto to
such extent, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by BNY
Midwest Trust Company or BNY Asset Solutions LLC, as applicable.

         Section 7.4 Delegation of Duties. The Servicer may delegate all or any
portion of its servicing duties under this Agreement to an Affiliate of the
Servicer by providing prior written notification to the Rating Agency and
obtaining the prior written consent of the Note Voting Amount, the Issuer, and
the Backup Servicer; provided, however, that no such delegation or
sub-contracting duties by the Servicer shall relieve the Servicer of its
responsibility with respect to such duties. If the Backup Servicer becomes the
Servicer hereunder, such Servicer may delegate its duties to one or more
subservicers; provided, however, that such delegation shall not relieve the
Servicer of its responsibility with respect to such duties. The Servicer may at
any time perform certain specific duties as Servicer through other
subcontractors, including through the Subservicer pursuant to the Subservicing
Agreement. The Subservicer shall be paid compensation on market terms by the
Servicer.

         Section 7.5 Servicer and Backup Servicer Not to Resign. Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.2, neither the Servicer nor the Backup Servicer shall
resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Agreement as
Servicer or Backup Servicer except upon a

                                       50
<PAGE>

determination that by reason of a change in legal requirements the performance
of its duties under this Agreement would cause it to be in violation of such
legal requirements in a manner which would have a material adverse effect on the
Servicer or the Backup Servicer, as the case may be, and the Note Voting Amount
does not elect to waive the obligations of the Servicer or the Backup Servicer,
as the case may be, to perform the duties which render it legally unable to act
or to delegate those duties to another Person. Any such determination permitting
the resignation of the Servicer or the Backup Servicer shall be evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered and acceptable to the Issuer and the
Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Backup Servicer or the Servicer
is the Trustee and the Trustee resigns or is removed pursuant to Section 6.8 of
the Indenture, the Backup Servicer or the Servicer, as the case may be, may
resign hereunder or may be removed by the Issuer. No resignation of the Servicer
shall become effective until the Backup Servicer or a successor Servicer that is
an Eligible Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of
the Servicer. No resignation or removal of the Backup Servicer shall become
effective until the Issuer shall have appointed a Person that is an Eligible
Servicer to act as successor Backup Servicer and such Person shall have assumed
the responsibilities and obligations of the Backup Servicer; provided, however,
that in the event a successor Backup Servicer is not appointed within 60 days
after the Backup Servicer has given notice of its resignation and has provided
the Opinion of Counsel required by this Section 7.5, the Backup Servicer may
petition a court for its removal. The Backup Servicer may resign for any reason,
provided an entity acceptable to the Trustee and the Note Voting Amount, in
their sole discretion, shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations
of the Backup Servicer prior to the effectiveness of any such resignation.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                           SERVICER TERMINATION EVENTS

         Section 8.1 Servicer Termination Event. For purposes of this Agreement,
each of the following shall constitute a "Servicer Termination Event":

                  (a) Any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Trustee for
         distribution to the Noteholders any proceeds or payment received and/or
         required to be delivered by the Servicer under the terms of this
         Agreement that continues unremedied for a period of two (2) Business
         Days after such payment is due;

                  (b) Failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Trustee the
         Servicer's Certificate on any Determination Date, or failure on the
         part of the Seller or the Servicer to observe their respective
         covenants and agreements set forth in Section 2.13, or failure on the
         part of the Servicer to observe its covenants and agreements set forth
         in Section 7.2(a);

                  (c) Failure or failures on the part of the Seller or the
         Servicer duly to observe or perform any covenants or agreements of the
         Seller or the Servicer set forth in this Agreement (other than the
         breach of a covenant or agreement which constitutes a Servicer
         Termination Event under another subsection of this Section 8.1), which
         failure remains unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days after a
         Responsible Officer of either the Seller or the Servicer has actual
         knowledge or notice thereof;

                                       51
<PAGE>

                  (d) The occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
         Servicer;

                  (e) Any representation, warranty or statement of the Servicer
         made in this Agreement or any certificate, report or other writing
         delivered pursuant hereto shall prove to be incorrect as of the time
         when the same shall have been made, and the incorrectness of such
         representation, warranty or statement has a material adverse effect on
         the Issuer or the interests of the Noteholders and, within thirty (30)
         days after a Responsible Officer of the Servicer has actual knowledge
         or notice thereof, the circumstances or condition in respect of which
         such representation, warranty or statement was incorrect (and the
         resulting adverse effect) shall not have been eliminated or otherwise
         cured, but not including any representation, warranty, covenant or
         statement related to any Purchased Receivable on which payment of the
         Purchase Amount is made in connection therewith pursuant to Section
         3.4;

                  (f) Any Performance Guarantor Default shall occur; or

                  (g) (i) the Servicer is in default (as principal or as
         guarantor or other surety) in the payment of any principal of or
         premium or make-whole amount or interest on any indebtedness that is
         outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000
         beyond any period of grace, if any, provided with respect thereto, or
         (ii) the Servicer is in default in the performance of or compliance
         with any term of any evidence of any indebtedness in an aggregate
         outstanding principal amount of at least $1,000,000 or of any mortgage,
         indenture or other agreement relating thereto or any other condition
         exists, and as a consequence of such default or condition such
         indebtedness has become, or has been declared, due and payable before
         its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

         Section 8.2 Consequences of a Servicer Termination Event. If a Servicer
Termination Event shall occur and be continuing, either the Trustee (to the
extent a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or at
the direction of the Note Voting Amount), the Issuer or the Note Voting Amount,
by notice given in writing to the Servicer and Backup Servicer (and to the
Trustee and the Issuer if given by the Noteholders) may terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement; provided, however,
that the terminated Servicer (if CBC is the terminated Servicer) shall remain
liable for any breach of its covenants described in Section 2.13 and Section
3.3(a) and for purchases of Receivables pursuant to Section 3.4. On or after the
receipt by the Servicer of such written notice or upon termination of the term
of the Servicer, all authority, power, obligations and responsibilities of the
Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the
Receivables or otherwise (other than any repurchase obligation of the Servicer
for which CBC shall remain liable), automatically shall pass to, be vested in
and become obligations and responsibilities of the Backup Servicer; provided,
however, that the successor Servicer shall (i) have no liability for, and shall
be indemnified by the terminated Servicer or CBC, and from the Collection
Account in accordance with Section 4.2(b), from and against any and all costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities (collectively, "Losses"),
arising out of or resulting from any act, omission or breach of

                                       52
<PAGE>

this Agreement of the terminated Servicer or CBC and (ii) have no obligation to
perform any repurchase or advancing obligations of CBC hereunder. The successor
Servicer shall have no liability to the Noteholders, the Trustee or to any other
Person for any Losses arising out of or resulting from delays of the terminated
Servicer in transmitting Quarterly Records or Collection Records, to the
successor Servicer, or for any other Losses incurred in the servicing
transition. The successor Servicer is authorized and empowered by this Agreement
to execute and deliver, on behalf of the terminated Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination. The terminated Servicer agrees to
cooperate with the successor Servicer in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the terminated Servicer under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the transfer to the successor Servicer for
administration by it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the
terminated Servicer for deposit, or have been deposited by the terminated
Servicer, in the Collection Account or thereafter received with respect to the
Receivables and the delivery to the successor Servicer of all Quarterly Records
and Collection Records and a computer tape in readable form as of the most
recent Business Day containing all information necessary to enable the successor
Servicer to service the Receivables. The terminated Servicer shall grant the
Issuer, the Trustee and the successor Servicer reasonable access to the
terminated Servicer's premises at the terminated Servicer's expense. The
terminated Servicer shall be entitled, for so long as it was performing its
duties and obligations as Servicer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, to its pro rata share of the Servicing Fee for the Quarterly Period
during which the termination occurred.

         Section 8.3       Appointment of Successor Servicer.

         (a) On and after the time the Servicer and the Backup Servicer receives
a notice of termination pursuant to Section 8.2, or upon the resignation of the
Servicer pursuant to Section 7.5, the Backup Servicer shall be the successor in
all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement
and the transactions set forth or provided for in this Agreement, and shall be
subject to all the rights, responsibilities, restrictions, duties, liabilities
and termination provisions relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. The Issuer and such successor shall take such
action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any
such succession. If a successor Servicer is acting as Servicer hereunder, it
shall be subject to termination under Section 8.2 upon the occurrence of any
Servicer Termination Event applicable to it as Servicer.

         (b) Notwithstanding the above, if the Backup Servicer shall be legally
unable or unwilling to act as Servicer, the Backup Servicer, the Trustee, the
Note Voting Amount or the Issuer may petition a court of competent jurisdiction
to appoint any Eligible Servicer to act as the successor to the Servicer.
Pending appointment pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Backup Servicer
shall act as successor Servicer unless it is legally unable to do so, in which
event the outgoing Servicer shall continue to act as Servicer until a successor
has been appointed and accepted such appointment. Subject to Section 7.5, no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as relieving the Backup Servicer
of its obligation to succeed as successor Servicer

                                       53
<PAGE>

upon the termination of the Servicer pursuant to Section 8.2 or the resignation
of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.5.

         (c) Any successor Servicer shall be entitled to such compensation
(whether payable out of the Collection Account or otherwise) as the Servicer
would have been entitled to under this Agreement if the Servicer had not
resigned or been terminated hereunder. In addition, any successor Servicer shall
be entitled to reasonable transition expenses incurred in acting as successor
Servicer.

         (d) The Backup Servicer may, with the prior consent of the Note Voting
Amount and at its own expense, subservice any and all of its duties and
responsibilities hereunder, including its duties as successor Servicer hereunder
should the Backup Servicer become the successor Servicer pursuant to Section 8.2
or this Section 8.3; provided, however, that notwithstanding such subservicing,
the Backup Servicer shall remain primarily liable for the performance of the
duties and obligations so subserviced.

         Section 8.4 Notification to Noteholders. Upon any termination of, or
appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Issuer shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Rating Agency, and the
Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to Noteholders at their
respective addresses appearing in the Note Register.

         Section 8.5 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Note Voting Amount may, on
behalf of all Holders of Notes, waive any default by the Servicer in the
performance of its obligations hereunder or Servicer Termination Event and its
consequences; provided, however, that the Note Voting Amount may not waive any
default in the full and timely payment to BNY Midwest Trust Company, as Trustee
or BNY Asset Solutions LLC, as Backup Servicer of any of their respective fees,
expenses or other amounts due to either of them. Upon any such waiver of a past
default or Servicer Termination Event, such default or Servicer Termination
Event shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Termination Event arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon. The Trustee shall provide the Noteholders and the Rating
Agency with notice of any waiver of any such default or Servicer Termination
Event.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   TERMINATION

         Section 9.1 Optional Purchase of All Receivables. On each Determination
Date as of which the Note Balance is equal to or less than 10% of the original
Note Balance, CBC shall have the option to purchase all, but not part, of the
Receivables. To exercise such option, CBC shall give the Issuer and the Trustee
written notice of such election at least 25 days prior to the Redemption Date
and pay the aggregate Purchase Amounts for the Receivables and following the
Redemption Date shall succeed to all interests in and to the Receivables;
provided, however, that the amount to be paid for such purchase (as set forth in
the following sentence) shall be sufficient to pay the full amount of the
Redemption Price of the Notes if applied in accordance

                                       54
<PAGE>

with Section 4.4. CBC shall deposit the aggregate Purchase Amounts for the
Receivables into the Collection Account on such Determination Date, and the
Trustee shall distribute the amounts so deposited in accordance with Section
4.4.

                                    ARTICLE X

exchange thereof or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent is
made upon the Note) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement, or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Notes; provided, however,
that no such amendment, modification or change shall without the prior written

         (f) If at any time the Servicer proposes to sell, grant a security
interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in receivables to any
prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, the Servicer shall give to
such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes, records
or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) that, if they refer
in any

                                       56

manner whatsoever to any Receivable, indicate clearly that such Receivable has

such security interest.

         (h) The Servicer shall furnish to the Issuer, the Trustee and the
Backup Servicer at any time upon reasonable request a list of all Receivables
then held by Issuer, together with a reconciliation of such list to the Schedule

covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any
reason whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or

provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement or of the Notes or the

                             -----------------------



On file at BNY MIDWEST TRUST COMPANY

<PAGE>

                                   SCHEDULE B



                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER
                  --------------------------------------------

         In addition to the representations and warranties set forth in the
Agreement, the Seller makes the following representations and warranties as to
itself and the Receivables conveyed by the Seller, on which the Issuer relies in
accepting such Receivables and in executing and issuing the Notes and upon which
the Trustee has relied in authenticating the Notes.

         1. Characteristics of Receivables. (A) Each Receivable (1) has been
originated in connection with the purchase of a policy of life insurance issued
by an Obligor and was originated by the Seller in the ordinary course of its
business and the Seller had (x) all necessary insurance licenses and approvals
required by any Obligor obligated to make payments in respect of any Receivable
or required by any applicable jurisdiction and (y) all other necessary licenses
and approvals in all jurisdictions where the failure to do so would adversely
affect (i) its ability to transfer the Receivables to the Issuer pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) the validity or enforceability of the Receivables or any
contract or agreement related thereto (iii) its ability to perform its
obligations hereunder and under the Related Documents to which it is a party and
(2) is subject to the first priority security interest in favor of the Issuer
pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, which in turn will be pledged to
the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders pursuant to the Indenture; and
(B) as of the Cutoff Date no payment with respect to any Receivable is overdue.

         2. Characteristics of Obligors. Each Obligor (other than Manufacturers
Life Insurance Company, Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company and Sun Life
Assurance Company of Canada) is incorporated or organized under the laws of a
State of the United States of America and, as of the Cutoff Date, no Obligor (A)
is the subject of any federal, state or other bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceeding or (B) is the subject of a judgment in its favor. Each payment with
respect to each Receivable will be made by the related Obligor free and clear of
and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto
including those imposed by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of
which such Person is organized or any political subdivision thereof.

         3. Location of Receivable Files. A complete Receivable File with
respect to each Receivable has been delivered to the Custodian on or prior to
the Closing Date.

         4. Schedule of Receivables. The information with respect to the
Receivables set forth in its Schedule of Receivables is true and correct as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

<PAGE>

         5. Adverse Selection. No selection procedures having an adverse effect
on the Noteholders have been utilized in selecting the Receivables from those
payment streams similar to the Receivables owned by it which met the selection
criteria contained in this Agreement.

         6. Compliance with Law. None of the contracts related to any
Receivable, at the time such Receivable was originated, contravened and, at the
execution of this Agreement contravenes, any requirements of applicable federal,
state and local laws, and regulations.

         7. No Government Obligor. None of the Receivables is due from the
United States of America or any state or from any agency, department, or
instrumentality of the United States of America or any state.

         8. Receivables in Force. No Receivable has been satisfied, exchanged,
surrendered, terminated, subordinated or rescinded, nor has any such Receivable
been excluded from the Lien granted pursuant to the Indenture.

         9. No Amendments. No payment extensions on any Receivable has been
granted, and no contract related to any Receivable has been amended or modified
(except as provided in the related Receivables File) and none of the provisions
of any contract related to any Receivable have been waived (except as provided
in the related Receivables File).

         10. No Defenses. As of the Closing Date, no right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense exists (other than any unasserted setoff,
recoupment or similar right set forth in any Obligor Receivable Agreement or
existing under applicable law) or has been asserted or threatened with respect
to any Receivable or any contract related thereto. The operation of the terms of
any Receivable or any contract related thereto or the exercise of any right
thereunder will not render such Receivable or any contract related thereto
unenforceable in whole or in part or subject to any such right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim, or defense (other than any unasserted setoff, recoupment
or similar right set forth in any Obligor Receivable Agreement or existing under
applicable law).

         11. No Fraud or Misrepresentation. Each Receivable was originated by it
without fraud, deceit or misrepresentation on its part.

         12. Receivables Not Assumable. No Receivable or any contract related
thereto is assumable by another Person in a manner which would release the
Obligor thereof from such Obligor's obligations to it with respect to payments
in respect of such Receivable.

         13. No Impairment. The Seller has not done anything to convey any right
to any Person that would result in such Person having a right to payments in
respect of any Receivable or otherwise to impair the rights of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or the Noteholders in any Receivable or the
proceeds thereof (other than contracts, agreements or other similar arrangements
entered into by the Seller or any of its identified current or former officers,
employees or members obligating the Seller (or such other person) to split
certain commissions in specified amounts with such Persons, which such Persons
and amounts have been identified to

<PAGE>

the Trustee on or prior to the Closing Date). Prior to the sale by the Seller of
the Receivables to the Issuer, the Seller did not convey information (or know of
any such conveyance by another Person) to the Issuer that would result in
constructive or actual knowledge by the Issuer that the interest of the Seller
in such Receivables or the proceeds thereof were subject to the actual or
claimed interest of any Person.

         14. No Default. No default, breach, violation or event which could
reasonably be expected to result in the termination of any contract related to
any Receivable has occurred; no continuing condition that with notice or the
lapse of time could reasonably be expected to result in a default, breach,
violation, or event which could reasonably be expected to result in the
termination under the terms of any insurance policy related to any contract
related to any Receivable has arisen as of the Closing Date; the Seller shall
not waive, and has not waived, any of the foregoing.

         15. Title. It is the intention of the Seller that the sale, transfer
and assignment contemplated in this Agreement constitutes an absolute sale (or
contribution) of the Receivables and the proceeds thereof to the Issuer and that
the beneficial interest in and title to such Receivables not be part of its
estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against it
under any bankruptcy law. No Receivable or the proceeds thereof has been sold,
transferred, assigned, or pledged by the Seller to any Person other than the
Issuer. Immediately prior to the sale, transfer and assignment herein
contemplated, the Seller had good and marketable title to each Receivable, and
was the sole owner thereof, free and clear of all Liens and, immediately upon
the transfer thereof, the Issuer shall have good and marketable title to each
the Receivable, and will be the sole owner thereof, free and clear of all Liens
(other than the Lien in favor of the Trustee pursuant to the Related Documents).

         16. Computer Tape. The Computer Tape made available by the Seller (or
the Servicer on its behalf) to the Issuer and the Backup Servicer on or prior to
the Closing Date was complete and accurate in all respects as of the Cutoff Date
and includes a description of the same Receivables that are described in the
Schedule of Receivables.

         17. Lawful Assignment. No Receivable has been originated in, or is
subject to the laws of, any jurisdiction under which the sale, transfer, and
assignment of such Receivable under this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or
voidable. The Seller has not entered into any contract, agreement or arrangement
with any account debtor that prohibits, restricts or conditions the assignment
of any portion of the Receivables (except in respect of which the required
consent to such assignment or waiver of such prohibition, restrictions or
conditions to such Assignment have been obtained).

         18. All Filings Made. All filings or other action (including, without
limitation, UCC filings) necessary in any jurisdiction to give the Issuer a
first priority perfected ownership interest, and the Trustee a first priority
perfected security interest, in the Receivables have been made.

<PAGE>

         19. Valid and Binding Obligation of Obligor. The related Obligor of
each Receivable is contractually obligated to make payments with respect to such
Receivable directly to the Seller (or to the Issuer (as assignee of such
Receivable)). Each Receivable and each contract related thereto is (a) in full
force and effect, (b) the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Obligor
thereunder and each other party thereto, (c) enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except only as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and
(d) all parties to such contract had full legal capacity to execute and deliver
such contract and all other documents related thereto. No event has occurred
under any contract related to a Receivable that would give the Obligor
thereunder the right to terminate such contract for cause or otherwise. All
necessary consents by each Obligor to the assignment of the Receivables have
been obtained and are in full force and effect.

         20. The Seller hereby makes represents, warrants, and covenants to each
other party to the Agreement and the Initial Purchaser, as follows, that on the
Closing Date:
