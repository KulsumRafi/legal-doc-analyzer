<U><LI>Compensation for Services</U>.  During the term of this Agreement, Buyer
shall pay Servicer a fee (&quot;<U>Servicing Fee</U>&quot;) at the rate of $2

under this Agreement as a result of a breach or alleged breach by the other
party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other agreement;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the making of any payment hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver by such party of any rights it may have under this
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, or the Program Agreement or any other related
agreement to which the parties hereto are party or under applicable
law.</LI></OL>

<U><LI>Settlement</U>.  Buyer and Servicer each shall designate a bank account
into which settlement funds (and not any Servicing Fee) due under Section 2.03
from the other party to this Agreement shall be wired.  From the Initial Closing
Date until the Conversion Date, Servicer shall provide Buyer with a Daily
Settlement Sheet in accordance with <U>Section 2.03(a)</U>.  Buyer or Servicer,
as the case may be, shall pay the net amount due on the Daily Settlement Sheet
each day by wire transfer to the designated settlement account by 11:00 a.m.,
Central time on the day on which the Daily Settlement Sheet is provided pursuant
to Section 2.03(a) by 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on that day.  In addition to any
other rights and remedies available to a party under this Agreement, in the
event Servicer or Buyer fails to make any such settlement payment by the time
required herein (which failure is caused by a factor within the Servicer's or
Buyer's control, as the case may be, and such delay results in the receiving
party being unable to invest such funds overnight, the amount due from Servicer
or Buyer, as the case may be, for such next day's settlement shall be
accompanied by interest on the delayed settlement (plus the prior day's
settlement amount if such payment has not been paid) amount, calculated on the
basis of an interest rate equal to the Federal Funds Interest Rate plus two
percent, divided by three hundred and sixty (360) for each day such amount is
overdue.</LI>
<U><LI>Payments</U>.  All payments on Accounts that are received by Servicer in
connection with its obligations under this Agreement will be processed and
credited as collected funds within one (1) Business Day and in accordance with
Regulation Z; <U>provided</U>, however, that, as permitted by Regulation Z,
Servicer may process and credit within five (5) days after receipt any payment
that does not conform to the payment requirements disclosed on the Account
periodic statement.  Servicer agrees that all payments received by Servicer will
be deemed to be held in trust for Buyer until settled in accordance with
<U>Section 3.02</U>.  Buyer shall have the right (at Buyer's sole cost, if any)
to conduct on-site audit of the payment processing process during normal
business hours; <U>provided</U>, however, that prior written notice of the audit
is provided to Servicer and such audit does not unreasonably interfere with
Servicer's normal operations.</LI>
<U><LI>Funds Received by Servicer After Conversion Date</U>.  Following the
Conversion Date, Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to forward,
or cause to be forwarded to Buyer (i)&nbsp;in the case of all funds received by
or credited to Servicer under the Accounts, within three (3) Business Days after
receipt by Servicer and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of all correspondence from
cardholders received with respect to the Accounts, within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt by Servicer.  Servicer shall provide to Buyer, via facsimile, a
daily settlement sheet which shall contain a summary of any such funds received
and forwarded.  In the event that Buyer receives funds or correspondence
relating to any account not included in the Account Portfolio Assets, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, within three (3) Business Days (in
the case of funds) or within ten (10) Business Days (in the case of
correspondence) after receipt, forward, or cause to be forwarded, to Servicer
all such funds and correspondence.  All such funds and correspondence shall be
sent by Servicer or Buyer, as applicable, by overnight mail or courier service
(in each case, at Buyer's expense).  The obligation to transmit funds shall
continue for a period of one year following the Conversion Date.  Effective on
the Conversion Date, (i)&nbsp;Servicer hereby appoints and empowers Buyer as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact solely to endorse any check or instrument made
payable to Servicer and submitted as payment on any outstanding balance of any
Account and (ii)&nbsp;Buyer hereby appoints and empowers Servicer as its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact solely to endorse any check or instrument made
payable to Buyer and submitted as payment on any outstanding balance of any
Account.</LI></OL>

<U><LI>Assignment</U>.  Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement
shall not be assigned or transferred by either party; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that Servicer may delegate all or part of its servicing
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate or any third party;
<U>provided</U> <U>further</U>, that no such delegation shall relieve Servicer

ineffective only to the extent invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable, and the
remainder of such provision and all other provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.</LI>
<U><LI>Entire Agreement; Amendments</U>.  This Agreement, together with the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto (which are hereby incorporated into and made a
part hereof), constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to
the subject matter herein.  This Agreement may be amended only by a written
document signed by each of the parties.  In the course of the planning and
coordination of this Agreement, written documents have been exchanged between
the parties.  Such written documents shall not be deemed to amend or supplement
this Agreement.  This Agreement and the rights and obligations created hereunder
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and no other person shall
acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.</LI>
<U><LI>Waivers</U>.  One party hereto may, with the prior written consent of the
other party hereto: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other actions of the other party under this Agreement; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement; (c) waive compliance with any of the conditions or covenants of the
other party contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive or modify performance of
any of the obligations of the other party under this Agreement.  Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of one party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by such party of compliance with any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or agreements contained
in this Agreement.  The waiver by one party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.</LI>
<U><LI>Governing Law and Waiver of Trial by Jury</U>.  This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York
without regard to its conflict of laws rules.  The parties further irrevocably
waive the right to trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding of any kind
or nature in any court to which it may be a party.</LI>
<U><LI>Dispute Resolution</U>.</LI>
<P>(a)&#9;All Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with this <U>Section
8.08</U>.  &quot;<U>Dispute</U>&quot; means any dispute, controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort,
statute or other legal or equitable theory (including without limitation, any
claim of fraud, misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement or any question of
validity or effect of this Agreement including this clause) or the breach or
termination thereof.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;The parties agree to communicate with each other to achieve informal
resolution of all Disputes that may arise under this Agreement.  However, if
such communication does not resolve such Dispute, the matter in dispute will be
subject to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in this Section 8.08.
The party that desires to initiate the dispute resolution shall notify the other
party in writing of the nature and details of the Dispute (the &quot;Dispute
Notice&quot;). Within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the Dispute
Notice, a face to face meeting of one or more principal officers of each party
shall be held at a mutually convenient time and location to negotiate a
resolution of the Dispute.  If negotiation does not resolve the matter, the
parties agree to submit the matter to mediation within forty (40) days from the
date of delivery of the Dispute Notice.  The mediation shall be administered in
accordance with American Arbitration Association's Commercial Mediation Rules.
The mediator will not have power to decide the Dispute, but will use mediation
techniques to assist the parties in reaching a resolution.  The costs of such
mediation shall be shared equally by the parties.  If the Dispute is not
resolved by negotiation or mediation within fifty (50) days of delivery of the
Dispute Notice, the parties agree to submit the matter in dispute to binding
arbitration which shall be conducted before JAMS/Endispute, Inc.
(&quot;JAMS&quot;) in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by
JAMS as in effect at the time of the commencement of the arbitration.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator acceptable to
the parties .  If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then (i) each
party shall choose one arbitrator and (ii) a third arbitrator shall be chosen by
the other two arbitrators; provided that each arbitrator chosen under (i) and
(ii) above shall not be an Affiliate of any party to such arbitration (the
&quot;Arbitrator(s)&quot;).  The Arbitrator(s) shall be bound by the terms of
this Agreement.  Any award made by the Arbitrator(s) shall be binding on the
parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, either party at any time may
require that a matter in dispute be submitted directly to arbitration,
irrespective of whether negotiation or mediation has been attempted or
completed.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority, taking into account the
parties' desire that any arbitration proceeding hereunder be reasonably
expedited and efficient, to permit the parties to conduct discovery.  Any such
discovery shall be (i)&nbsp;guided generally by and be no broader than permitted
under the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and (ii)&nbsp;subject
to the Arbitrator and the parties entering into a mutually acceptable
confidentiality agreement.</P>
<P>(f)&#9;The Arbitrator's or Arbitrators' decision and award in any such
arbitration shall be made and delivered within 120 days of the date on which
such arbitration proceedings commenced.</P>
<P>(g)&#9;The Arbitrator's or Arbitrators' decision shall be in writing and
shall be as brief as possible and will include the basis for the Arbitrator's
decision.  A record of the arbitration proceeding shall be kept.</P>
<P>(h)&#9;Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered into
any court having jurisdiction thereof.</P>
<P>(i)&#9;The Arbitrator(s) shall have the power but not the obligation to award
to the party it deems to have prevailed, all or a portion of the costs of the
arbitration (including, transcripts, room rental fees and fees and expenses of
the arbitrator and JAMS, and the reasonable legal fees, costs and disbursements
of the prevailing party thereto); <U>provided</U>, that if court proceedings to
stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the non-prevailing party in
such proceedings shall pay all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney's fees
incurred in connection with such court proceedings.</P>
<P>(j)&#9;The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this <U>Section 8.08</U>
shall not limit the right of any party to seek from a court of competent
jurisdiction any equitable relief with respect to the Dispute to which such
party may otherwise be entitled, including, without limitation, specific
performance or injunctive or other relief.</P>
<P>(k)&#9;The parties agree to participate in any arbitration in good faith.</P>
<U><LI>Books and Records</U>.  Until the Conversion Date, and for any period
required by applicable law, each party shall maintain books of account and
records, in accordance with standard accounting practices and procedures, of all
transactions arising in connection with its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement.</LI>
<U><LI>Expenses</U>.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, any costs,
expenses, or other charges incurred by either of the parties hereto shall be
borne by the party incurring such cost, expense or charge.</LI>
<U><LI>Relationship of the Parties</U>.  The parties hereto agree that in
performing their responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement, they are in the
position of independent contractors.  This Agreement is not intended to create,
nor does it create, and shall not be construed to create, a relationship of
partner or joint venture or any association for profit between Servicer and
Buyer.  Servicer and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement is being entered into
by Servicer as an incident to the Purchase Agreement for a limited transitional
period as an accommodation to Buyer and that Servicer does not intend to, and
shall not be required to act or serve as a fiduciary of Buyer, segregate Buyer's
funds, or satisfy regulatory or statutory requirements applicable to Buyer.</LI>
<U><LI>Counterparts</U>.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, but together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.</LI>
<U><LI>Force Majeure</U>.  Neither party to this Agreement shall be liable to
the other by reason of any failure in performance of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms if such failure arises out of a cause beyond the
control and without the fault or negligence of such party.  Such causes may
include but are not limited to acts of God, of the public enemy or of civil or
military authority, unavailability of energy resources, system or communication
failure, delay in transportation, fires, strikes, riots or war.  In the event of
any force majeure occurrence, the disabled party shall use its best efforts to
meet its obligations as set forth in this Agreement.</LI></OL>
