                  such services are described in such Alliance Agreement, and
                  the characteristics and technical specifications for such
                  services have been set forth in the applicable specifications
                  exhibit (e.g. comparable in substance and format to Exhibit B
                  of the TSA) attached thereto, as amended from time to time in
                  writing by mutual agreement of the parties ("Voice Services")
                  (collectively the "Williams Supplied Services"). SBC shall be
                  the Supplying Party and Williams shall be the Supplied Party
                  with respect to platform and related services provided
                  pursuant to the PSA (the "SBC Supplied Services"). With
                  respect to any Williams Supplied Services that are Off-Net,
                  SBC may request that Williams arrange for such Services on its
                  behalf, but is not under an obligation to do so, subject to
                  the procedure for Off-Net Direct Purchases set forth below.
                  With respect to all Layer 1 Services whether first considered
                  On-Net or Off-Net, SBC shall seek to obtain such Service or
                  product from Williams. If Williams informs SBC that the
                  requested Service or product cannot be provided On-Net, SBC
                  shall be permitted to seek such Off-Net Service or product
                  from any third party directly ("Off-Net Direct Purchases"),
                  provided that SBC shall deliver to Williams a quarterly report
                  detailing all Off-Net Direct Purchases by LATA pairs and
                  further provided that SBC and Williams will, to the extent
                  commercially practicable, make such Off-Net Service available
                  to the other [********* ********************************].

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, SBC and Williams shall
                  negotiate in good faith the applicable characteristics and
                  technical specifications of wave services or gigabit ethernet
                  (wide area) services at such time as Williams shall notify SBC
                  that (i) it is prepared to offer such services as the
                  Supplying Party to SBC and (ii) has the technical capability
                  to offer such services as required by SBC, and the parties
                  shall amend the applicable Alliance Agreement, including the
                  service specifications exhibit thereto, to reflect the
                  addition of wave services and gigabit ethernet (wide area)
                  services and such characteristics and technical
                  specifications.

                  Nothing in this Section 3.3.2 shall be construed to limit
                  either Party's rights or obligations as set forth in that
                  certain letter agreement between Williams Local Network, Inc.
                  and SBC Telecom, Inc. dated June 9, 2000.

                  Party fails to meet the required Quality of Service Standard

                  3.3.4. Notwithstanding Section 3.3.2, SBC may procure from
                  third parties Service that Williams would otherwise provide,
                  in order to achieve diversity of the Service under the
                  following requirements ("Diverse Services").

                  (i) with respect to Layer 1 Services, Williams is unable to
                  provide On-Net physical diversity as defined below; or

                  (ii) Carrier diversity is requested in writing by the Supplied
                  Party's customer.

                  In such event, SBC must disclose to Williams, on a quarterly
                  basis, when such diversity is required. SBC shall have no
                  obligation to provide Williams with any of the details of any
                  customer request for carrier or physical diversity, but shall
                  disclose in general terms the size, scale and location of the
                  diversity that SBC is seeking. Williams shall be entitled to
                  an audit of SBC's compliance with this Section 3.3.4 relating
                  to physical and carrier diversity, which audit shall be
                  carried out in accordance with the provisions of

         This information contained in this Amendment No. 1 is not for use or
disclosure outside SBC, Williams, their affiliated companies and their third
party representatives, except under written agreement by the contracting
Parties.

                  Article 8 below, except that (i) any such audit may be
                  performed not more frequently than quarterly, and not more
                  often than twice in any twelve month period, and (ii) SBC
                  shall not be required to retain documentation with respect to
                  its compliance with this Section 3.3.4 for more than one year.
                  In situations in which Williams is not entitled to be the
                  primary carrier, (e.g. uncompetitive QoS Standard, pricing),
                  SBC will consider Williams to fulfill diversity requirements
                  as the secondary provider.

                  For purposes of this Section 3.3.4, "physical diversity" has
                  the meaning set forth in Schedule A to this Agreement. In the
                  event that the Parties are negotiating applicable
                  characteristics and technical specifications for any Williams
                  Supplied Services or any products or services that the Parties
                  contemplate adding to the Williams Supplied Services, then the
                  Parties shall also negotiate in good faith the physical
                  diversity requirements for such product or service, and shall
                  include such diversity requirements in Schedule B to the TSA
                  or such other applicable specifications exhibit referred to in
                  Section 3.3.2 above.

                  The SBC Affiliate must stipulate at the time of order
                  placement individual design requirements pertaining to which
                  protected or unprotected circuits must be "physically diverse"
                  from one another. SBC shall be entitled to an audit of
                  Williams's compliance with this Schedule A relating to its
                  representations to SBC of the physical infrastructure related
                  to the physical diversity of two circuits, which audit shall
                  be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 8
                  of this Agreement, except that (i) any such audit may be
                  performed not more frequently than quarterly, and not more
                  often than twice in any twelve month period, and (ii) Williams
                  shall not be required to retain documentation with respect to
                  its compliance with these requirements for more than one year
                  after the expiration of the term of such circuits.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all events, (i) SBC would
                  use Williams Supplied Services at least equally to that of the
                  largest of the other vendors supplying Diverse Services in the
                  context of a particular request for Diverse Services; (ii) in
                  no case will the use of Diverse Services in any Services
                  Category (as defined below) in a calendar quarter exceed
                  [**************************** ********************] for all

AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO MASTER ALLIANCE AGREEMENT



                                   SCHEDULE A


For purposes of Section 3.3.4 of the Master Alliance Agreement, the term
"physical diversity" means: (a) with respect to two or more separate, distinct
circuits whether protected or unprotected, that the physical paths of such
circuits be at least twenty-five feet (25') from one another, provided that the
two paths may get closer than this limit without violating these requirements of
physical diversity if the section of close proximity is within a physical
Point-of-Presence (POP) or building containing that POP and each circuit is
independently hardened via the use of rigid conduit outside of the POP walls,
and further provided that, if the two (or more) circuits traverse the same POP,
each circuit maps through fully separate and distinct transmission, switching,
and routing equipment, such that it offers no single point of failure in the
network; and (b) with respect to transmission, switching, and routing equipment,
that they are completely independent of one another with no shared common
hardware or software components with the data or control planes.
Notwithstanding, these requirements for physical diversity should not be
construed to require separate network management systems such as Naviscore.
Termination of the two circuits on the same LD voice switch will not violate
these physical diversity requirements if the circuits are provisioned to
separate SPMs or line shelves.

In addition to the foregoing, physical diversity between two or more separate
and distinct circuits shall require all of the following:

         o        Segregated right-of-ways or paths for conduit containing fiber
                  cabling as described above;

         o        Segregated POP entrance facilities for conduit/fiber;

         o        Segregated fiber cabling as described above;

         o        Segregated transmission, switching, or routing equipment with
                  no commonality of equipment components; and

         o        Fully protected power systems within a single POP.

This definition of physical diversity does not apply to wave services, wide area
gigabit ethernet services or any other services that do not, as of September 23,
2002, constitute Williams Supplied Services. In the event that the Parties
negotiate applicable characteristics and technical specifications for any such
services, then the Parties shall also negotiate in good faith either an
amendment to Schedule A or to Schedule B of the TSA setting forth the physical
diversity requirements for such product or service.

         This definition for "physical diversity" shall be independent of the
industry definition of "path diversity for a single protected transmission
system" which primarily

stipulates only non-collapsed, diverse fiber route requirements, which is
considered a subset of the physical diversity definition.

         This same definition shall apply to the local components of the service
as well. SBC will not require Williams to provide physical diversity across long
haul circuits if the local transport circuits are not as diverse as the long
haul circuits.
