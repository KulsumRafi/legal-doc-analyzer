<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Hexcel Corporation Incentive Stock Plan (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined

terms used in this Agreement and set forth in the Plan shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, as the Plan may be amended from time to time, provided that any such amendment of the Plan must be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;X of the Plan. The
RSUs granted herein constitute an Award within the meaning of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Grantee shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in shares of the Company's common stock, $.01 par
value per share (the "Common
Stock") in respect of the RSUs until such RSUs have vested and been distributed to the Grantee in the form of shares of Common Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as provided in this Section&nbsp;2(b), the RSUs and any interest therein may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of,
except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, prior to the distribution of the Common Stock in respect of such RSUs and subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement.
Any attempt to transfer RSUs in contravention of this Section is void </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ab initio</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. RSUs shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall be permitted to transfer RSUs to members of his or her immediate family (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, children, grandchildren
or spouse), trusts for the benefit of such family members, and partnerships whose only partners are such family members; provided, however, that no consideration can be paid for the transfer of the
RSUs and the transferee of the RSUs shall be subject to all conditions applicable to the RSUs (including all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement) prior to transfer. </FONT></P>

Common Stock in respect of the RSUs, the Company shall issue to the Grantee or the Grantee's personal representative a stock certificate representing such shares of Common Stock, free of any
restrictions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>No Guarantee of Employment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Nothing set forth herein or in the Plan shall confer upon the Grantee any right of continued

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Notices</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or when
