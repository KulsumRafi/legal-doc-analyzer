EXECUTIVE&#146;S RIGHT TO ASSETS</FONT></H1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The rights of the Executive,  any  Beneficiary  of the  Executive,  or any other
person  claiming  through the Executive  under this  Agreement,  shall be solely
those  of an  unsecured  general  creditor  of  the  Bank.  The  Executive,  the
Beneficiary  of  the  Executive,  or  any  other  person  claiming  through  the
Executive,  shall  only have the right to receive  from the Bank those  payments
which are specified  under this  Agreement.  The  Executive  agrees that he, his
Beneficiary,  or any other person  claiming  through him shall have no rights or
interests  whatsoever in any asset of the Bank, including any insurance policies
or  contracts  which the Bank may  possess  or obtain  to  informally  fund this
Agreement.  Any  asset  used or  acquired  by the  Bank in  connection  with the
liabilities it has assumed under this Agreement,  except as expressly  provided,
shall not be deemed to be held under any trust for the benefit of the  Executive
or his Beneficiaries, nor shall it be considered security for the performance of
the obligations of the Bank. It shall be and remain, a general,  unpledged,  and
unrestricted asset of the Bank. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Bank shall have no obligation  to set aside,  earmark or entrust any fund or
money with which to pay its obligations under this Agreement. The Executive, his
Beneficiaries  or any successor in interest to him, shall be and remain simply a
general  creditor of the Bank in the same manner as any other creditor  having a
general  claim for  matured  and  unpaid  compensation.  The Bank  reserves  the
absolute  right,  at  its  sole  discretion,  to  either  fund  the  obligations
undertaken by the Agreement or to refrain from funding the same and to determine
the extent,  nature, and method of such informal funding.  Should the Bank elect
to fund  this  Agreement,  in whole or in part,  through  the  purchase  of life
insurance, mutual funds, disability policies or annuities, the Bank reserves the
absolute right, in its sole  discretion,  to terminate such funding at any time,
in whole or in part.  At no time shall the  Executive be deemed to have any lien
nor right,  title or interest in or to any specific funding investment or to any
assets of the Bank. If the Bank elects to invest in a life insurance, disability
or annuity  policy  upon the life of the  Executive,  then the  Executive  shall
assist the Bank by freely  submitting  to a physical  examination  and supplying
such  additional  information  necessary to obtain such  insurance or annuities.

modify or otherwise  encumber in advance any of the benefits payable  hereunder,
nor shall any of said  benefits  be subject to  seizure  for the  payment of any
debts,  judgments,  alimony or separate maintenance owed by the Executive or his
Beneficiary, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of bankruptcy,
