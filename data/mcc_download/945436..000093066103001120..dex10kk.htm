immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Commencement Date. The period during which Executive is employed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be referred to as the "<U>Employment Period</U>." During the Employment Period,
Executive shall serve as an executive officer of the Company and shall have such duties and responsibilities as are customarily assigned to individuals serving in such position and such other duties as the Company specifies from time to time.

"<U>Code</U>"), or any successor thereto, such Initial Service Option shall not be exercisable until the earlier of the date the Company will receive its deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code and the date that is nine years and ten months from
