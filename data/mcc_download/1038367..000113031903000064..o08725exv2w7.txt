         ("Detention Co.")
         ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------
         </TABLE>


     All of the issued and outstanding shares in each of Absolon Co., Crime
     Spree Co., Rough Rider Co., Limit Co. and Detention Co. (collectively, the
     "Prodcos"), which are single-purpose companies, are owned 100% by CPC or a
     subsidiary of CPC. Prior to Closing, CPC shall cause to be transferred 100%
     of the shares of the Prodcos to GFT Entertainment Inc, a clean company
     without any liabilities. On Closing, Peace Arch shall acquire 100% of the
     shares of GFT Entertainment Inc.


     B. Assigned Receivable Assets:

     B. 1 Federal and Ontario Tax credit receivables due to the ProdCos,
     estimated at CDN$ 280,000

anything to compromise the Loan prior to Closing and shall ensure a security
interest (approved by Peace Arch) is registered in favour of Peace Arch (or a
subsidiary) in the appropriate priority and registry upon Closing.

respect of proceeds of France exploitation of Crime Spree (the "Assigned French
Proceeds"). Provided Peace Arch has received actual cash from the Assigned
Receivable Assets in the amount of C$ 2,500,000, then with respect to any monies
received in excess of $ 2,500,000 from the Assigned Receivable Assets (the
"Excess") or the net profits received by any of the ProdCos ("Net Profits"),
Peace Arch shall cause such ProdCo to remit forthwith such Excess or Net Profits
to CPC until an amount equal to the Assigned French Proceeds actually received
has been recouped by CPC. Thereafter, any further Net Profits will be the
property of Peace Arch or its subsidiaries.

Arch's use of the word "Greenlight" or "GFT" in its corporate name and Peace
Arch's employment of GFT staff and shall grant the right to Peace Arch to
continue the ongoing business and development activities of GFT;

     Upon Closing, the Production Assets and Assigned Receivable Assets will be
conveyed to Peace Arch in consideration for the issuance of 8,333,333 Class B
Subordinate Voting treasury shares of Peace Arch, subject to applicable
securities regulations and stock exchange rules. To the extent possible, such
asset transfers will be done on a tax-free rollover basis. Prior to Closing, no
changes shall be made to any agreement which may affect the assets being
conveyed above except as contemplated herein without the written approval of
Peace Arch.

4.   At the Peace Arch AGM presently scheduled for January 20, 2003, the
     transactions will be considered for approval by the shareholders of Peace
     Arch. Upon shareholder approval of the transactions or upon Closing (to be
     determined at the AGM), the directors of Peace Arch shall resign, except to
     the extent that CPC and Watson desire to retain any of the existing
     directors as such, and the resigning directors shall be replaced by
     nominees of CPC and Watson, provided such nominees are acceptable to the
     securities regulatory authorities and stock exchanges having jurisdiction
     and qualify under the British Columbia Company Act (the "Act").

5.   On Closing, Gary Howsam shall, subject to being acceptable to the
     securities regulatory authorities and stock exchanges having jurisdiction
     and qualifying under the Act, become the most senior executive officer of
     Peace Arch with overall management authority, subject to and reporting to
     the Board of Directors of Peace Arch in accordance with the terms of his
     engagement agreement set out in Schedule "A" hereto.

6.   It is hereby agreed that the debt, liabilities and obligations of Peace
     Arch to Fremantle Media Enterprises Ltd. and Comerica Bank be resolved in
     accordance with the agreements set out and attached in Schedules "B" and
     "C" hereto, such agreements to be put in long-form agreements, if required,
     either before or after the Closing.

7.   The documentary and financial closing of the transactions contemplated
     hereby (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as possible following the
     shareholders of Peace Arch having approved the transactions at the annual
     general meeting (the "AGM"), it being acknowledged that such AGM is
     presently scheduled to take place on January 20, 2003, but in no event
     shall Closing take place later than January 31, 2003.

8.   Notwithstanding the actual date of Closing of the transaction, such
     transaction shall be effective as of December 20, 2002 (or as soon
     thereafter as allowed under GAAP), for all accounting purposes.

9.   This term sheet and the agreement between the parties in respect of the
     transactions contemplated hereby (the "Agreement"), its existence and its
     terms, are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties to any
     person, except to their respective directors, senior management and
     professional advisors on a "need-to-know" basis, provided in each case that
     such persons are under an equivalent duty of confidentiality, and except as
     may be required pursuant to any statutory or securities regulatory or stock
     exchange requirement, provided that CPC and Watson shall have an
     opportunity to review and comment upon any such required disclosure.

10.  Each of the parties shall bear its own expenses in connection with carrying
     out the terms of this Agreement.

11.  This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are conditional
     upon and subject to approval by Peace Arch's Shareholders, and the
     obtaining of any regulatory and stock exchange approvals, which in each
     case Peace Arch will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain.
     Subject to these conditions, this Agreement is final and binding on the
     parties hereto.

12.  This Agreement is written in the name of CPC on the understanding that CPC
     may form one or more subsidiaries to carry out its terms. Furthermore, the
     parties acknowledge that the structuring of the transaction contemplated in
     paragraph 3 will be adjusted so as to take into account the advice of the
     parties' advisors on such matters as tax, tax credits, securities,
     accounting, and legal matters. The parties shall act in good faith and on
     reasonable commercial grounds in this regard.

13.  Peace Arch shall ensure that, prior to Closing, neither it nor any of its
     subsidiaries make any material operating, financing or investing decisions
     without CPC's written approval, including without limitation, changes in
     personnel and issuance of stock options. Peace Arch represents and warrants
     to CPC that there are no threatened or pending lawsuits against it or its
     subsidiaries other than as disclosed in Schedule "D" hereto, that it has
     the full power and authority to enter into this transaction subject to the
     conditions set out


<PAGE>

     in 11. herein. These representations and warranties are for the sole
     benefit of CPC and any of them may be waived by CPC at any time.

14.  CPC shall ensure that, prior to Closing, none of the Prodcos make any
     material financing or investing decisions without Peace Arch's written
     approval. CPC represents and warrants to Peace Arch that each of the
     productions being undertaken by the Prodcos are all materially on budget,
     that there are no outstanding or threatened lawsuits against the Prodcos or
     the Films, that, other than disclosed herein, there are no material
     charge-holders, lien-holders or security interest holders against the
     Prodcos at this date, nor will there be on Closing and that it has the full
     power and authority to enter into this transaction and to convey the assets
     herein conveyed to Peace Arch. These representations and warranties are
     each given for the sole benefit of Peace Arch and any of them may be waived
     by Peace Arch at any time.

15.  Pending the Closing, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and settle
     the terms of a more formal agreement embodying the terms of this Term Sheet
     and other industry terms, conditions, representations, warranties and
     covenants standard to such a formal agreement, failing which this Term
     Sheet shall remain valid and binding on each of the parties, subject only
     to paragraph 11 above.

16.  This agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of British
     Columbia.

Terms agreed to and accepted this 18th  day of December, 2002
