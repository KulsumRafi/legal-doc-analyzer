<P ALIGN="LEFT">3. Executive acknowledges that the Company will have no adequate
remedy at law if Executive violates the terms of paragraph 2 above. In such
event, notwithstanding paragraph 6 below, the Company shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain in any court of competent
jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of
specific performance of paragraph 2 of this Agreement. If, in any such
proceeding, the court finds that the scope of protections afforded the Company
is too broad to be enforceable under relevant law, then it is the intent of the
parties that the court reduce the scope of the protections, but only to the
extent necessary to make the protections enforceable, and then to enforce the
protections as reduced in scope. </P>

specified term, and nothing herein is intended to, nor shall be construed as,
changing the nature of Executive&#146;s employment from an at-will relationship.

not otherwise address Executive&#146;s compensation or benefits, the duties and
responsibilities of his position, or any of the Company&#146;s other rights as
employer. </P>

enforced and governed under its laws, without regard to principles of conflict
of laws. </P>

relating to this Agreement, other than the Company&#146;s attempt to obtain
injunctive relief under paragraph 3 above, shall be settled exclusively by
arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the
award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
