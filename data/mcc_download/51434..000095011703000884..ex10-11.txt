statements and certificates and reports as to financial matters required to be
delivered to the Lenders hereunder shall (unless otherwise disclosed to the
Lenders in writing at the time of delivery thereof in the manner described in
subsection (b) below) be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that used in the
preparation of the latest financial statements furnished to the Lenders
hereunder (which, until the first financial statements are delivered under

All calculations made for the purposes of determining compliance with this
Agreement shall (except as otherwise expressly provided herein) be made by
application of generally accepted accounting

                                      -17-


principles applied on a basis consistent with that used in the preparation of
the latest annual or quarterly financial statements furnished to the Lenders
pursuant to Section 6.01 unless (i) the Company shall have objected to
determining such compliance on such basis at the time of delivery of such
financial statements or (ii) the Required Lenders shall so object in writing
within 30 days after delivery of such financial statements, in either of which
events such calculations shall be made on a basis consistent with those used in
the preparation of the latest financial statements as to which such objection
shall not have been made (which, if objection is made in respect of the first
financial statements delivered under Section 6.01, shall mean the financial
statements referred to in Section 3.02).

          (b) Descriptions of Material Variations. The Company shall deliver to
the Lenders at the same time as the delivery of any annual or quarterly
financial statement under Section 6.01 a description in reasonable detail of any
material variation between the application of accounting principles employed in
the preparation of such statement and the application of accounting principles
employed in the preparation of the next preceding annual or quarterly financial
statements as to which no objection has been made in accordance with the last
sentence of paragraph (a) above and reasonable estimates of the difference
between such statements arising as a consequence thereof.

          (c) Changes of Fiscal Years. To enable the ready and consistent
determination of compliance with the covenants set forth in Article VI, the
Company will not change the last day of its fiscal year from December 31 of each
year, or the last days of the first three fiscal quarters in each of its fiscal
years from March 31, June 30 and September 30 of each year, respectively,
without giving prior notice of such change to each Lender and the Administrative
Agent.

          SECTION 1.05. Currencies; Currency Equivalents. At any time, any
reference in the definition of the term "Agreed Foreign Currency" or in any
other provision of this Agreement to the Currency of any particular nation means
the lawful currency of such nation at such time whether or not the name of such
Currency is the same as it was on the date hereof. Except as provided in Section
2.09(b) and the last sentence of Section 2.17(a), for purposes of determining
(i) whether the amount of any Borrowing, together with all other Borrowings then
outstanding or to be borrowed at the same time as such Borrowing, would exceed
the aggregate amount of the Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of
the Commitments and (iii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
Borrowings, the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing that is
denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent
of the amount of the Foreign Currency of such Borrowing determined as of the
date of such Borrowing (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the
definition of the term "Borrowing"). Wherever in this Agreement in connection
with a Borrowing or Loan an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple
amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Loan is denominated in a
Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent
of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest 1,000 units of such Foreign
Currency).

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDITS

          SECTION 2.01. The Commitments; Borrowings by Approved Borrowers.

          (a) The Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender agrees to make Syndicated Loans in Dollars or in any Agreed
Foreign Currency to the Borrowers from time to time during the Availability
Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (a) such
Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's Commitment or (b) the
sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Competitive Loans exceeding the total Commitments. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Syndicated Loans.

          (b) Borrowings by Approved Borrowers. The Company may, at any time or
from time to time during the Availability Period, designate one or more Wholly
Owned Consolidated Subsidiaries as Borrowers hereunder by furnishing to the
Administrative Agent a letter (a "Designation Letter") in duplicate,
substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, duly completed and executed by the
Company and such Subsidiary. Upon approval by the Administrative Agent (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of such Subsidiary as an Approved
Borrower, which approval shall be evidenced by the Administrative Agent signing
and returning to the Company a copy of such Designation Letter, such Subsidiary
shall be an Approved Borrower. So long as all principal and interest on all
Loans of any Approved Borrower and all other amounts payable by such Approved
Borrower hereunder have been paid in full, the Company may terminate its status
as an Approved Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Administrative Agent a
letter (a "Termination Letter"), substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2, duly
completed and executed by the Company and such Approved Borrower. Any
Termination Letter furnished in accordance with this Section shall be effective
upon receipt by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Approved Borrower shall not
affect any obligation of such Approved Borrower theretofore incurred.

          SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings.

          (a) Obligations of Lenders. Each Syndicated Loan shall be made as part
of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Currency and Type made by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. Each
Competitive Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.04. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by
it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided
that the Commitments and Competitive Bids of the Lenders are several and no
Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as
required.

          (b) Type of Loans. Subject to Section 2.12, (i) each Syndicated
Borrowing shall be constituted entirely of ABR Loans or of Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in a single Currency as the respective Borrower may request in
accordance herewith, and (ii) each Competitive Borrowing shall be constituted
entirely of Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate Loans

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -19-


denominated in a single Currency as the respective Borrower may request in
accordance herewith. Each ABR Loan shall be denominated in Dollars. Each Lender
at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign
branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise
of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. At the
commencement of the Interest Period for any Syndicated Borrowing, such
Syndicated Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $15,000,000 or a larger
multiple of $1,000,000; provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate
amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Each
Competitive Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 or a
larger multiple of $1,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Class, Currency and
Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any
time be more than a total of fifteen Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowings
outstanding.

          (d) Limitations on Lengths of Interest Periods. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request, or
to elect to convert to or continue as a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the
Commitment Termination Date.

          SECTION 2.03. Requests for Syndicated Borrowings. To request a
Syndicated Borrowing, a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request by telephone (a) in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing
denominated in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, (b) in the case of a
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, not later
than 11:00 a.m., London time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing or (c) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Company (on its own behalf or, as applicable, on behalf of an Approved
Borrower). Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrower and the aggregate amount and Currency of the
     requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) in the case of a Syndicated Borrowing denominated in Dollars,
     whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency
     Borrowing;

          (iv) in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest
     Period therefor, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of
     the term "Interest Period" and permitted under Section 2.02(d); and

                                      -20-


          (v) the location and number of the account to which funds are to be
     disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.

If no election as to the Type of Syndicated Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Syndicated Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing unless an Agreed
Foreign Currency has been specified, in which case the requested Syndicated
Borrowing shall be a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such Agreed Foreign
Currency. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, (i) if the Currency specified for such
Borrowing is Dollars (or if no Currency has been so specified), the requested
Borrowing shall be made instead as an ABR Borrowing, and (ii) if the Currency
specified for such Borrowing is an Agreed Foreign Currency, the respective
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. If no election as to the Currency of a Syndicated Borrowing is
specified, then the requested Syndicated Borrowing shall be denominated in
Dollars. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04. Competitive Bid Procedure.

          (a) Requests for Bids by the Borrowers. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, from time to time during the Availability Period a
Borrower may request Competitive Bids and may (but shall not have any obligation
to) accept Competitive Bids and borrow Competitive Loans denominated in Dollars
or in any Foreign Currency; provided that the sum of the total Revolving Credit
Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans
at any time shall not exceed the total Commitments. To request Competitive Bids,
a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone,
in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, four Business Days (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing
denominated in a Foreign Currency, 11:00 a.m., London time, five Business Days)
before the date of the proposed Borrowing and, in the case of a Fixed Rate
Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time (or, in the case of a
Fixed Rate Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, 10:00 a.m., London
time), two Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided
that the Borrowers may in the aggregate submit up to (but not more than) three
Competitive Bid Requests on the same day, and a Competitive Bid Request shall
not be made within five Business Days after the date of any previous Competitive
Bid Request, unless any and all such previous Competitive Bid Requests shall
have been withdrawn or all Competitive Bids received in response thereto
rejected. Each such telephonic Competitive Bid Request shall be confirmed
promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Competitive Bid Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and
signed by the Company (on behalf of itself or, as applicable, an Approved
Borrower). Each such telephonic and written Competitive Bid Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrower and the aggregate amount and Currency of the
     requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

<PAGE>


                                      -21-


          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing or a
     Fixed Rate Borrowing;

          (iv) the Interest Period for such Borrowing, which shall be a period
     contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

          (v) the location and number of the account to which funds are to be
     disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.

Promptly following receipt of a Competitive Bid Request in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of the details
thereof by telecopy, inviting the Lenders to submit Competitive Bids.

          (b) Making of Bids by Lenders. Each Lender may (but shall not have any
obligation to) make one or more Competitive Bids in response to a Competitive
Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid by a Lender must be in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and must be received by the Administrative Agent by
telecopy, in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than
9:30 a.m, New York City time, three Business Days (or, in the case of a
Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, 9:30 a.m,
London time, four Business Days) before the proposed date of such Competitive
Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 9:30 a.m,
New York City time (or, in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing denominated in a
Foreign Currency, 9:30 a.m, London time), on the proposed date of such
Competitive Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the
form approved by the Administrative Agent may be rejected by the Administrative
Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Lender of such
rejection as promptly as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall specify (i) the
principal amount (which shall be $15,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000
and which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing
requested by the respective Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that such
Lender is willing to make, (ii) the Competitive Bid Rate or Competitive Bid
Rates at which such Lender is prepared to make such Loan or Loans (expressed as
a percentage rate per annum in the form of a decimal to no more than four
decimal places) and (iii) the Interest Period for each such Loan and the last
day thereof.

          (c) Notification of Bids by Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the respective Borrower by telecopy of the
Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount specified in each Competitive Bid
and the identity of the Lender that shall have made such Competitive Bid.

          (d) Acceptance of Bids by the Borrowers. Subject only to the
provisions of this paragraph, a Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive
Bid. Such Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed
by telecopy in a form approved by the Administrative Agent, whether and to what
extent such Borrower has decided to accept or reject each Competitive Bid, in
the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m, New
York City time, three Business Days (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing
denominated in a Foreign Currency, 2:00 p.m., London time, four Business Days)
before the date of the proposed Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a
Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m, New York City time (or, in the
case of a Fixed Rate

                                      -22-


Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, 10:30 a.m, London time), on the
proposed date of the Competitive Borrowing; provided, that (i) the failure of
such Borrower to give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of each
Competitive Bid, (ii) such Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a
particular Competitive Bid Rate if such Borrower rejects a Competitive Bid made
at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Competitive
Bids accepted by such Borrower shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
requested Competitive Borrowing specified in the related Competitive Bid
Request, (iv) to the extent necessary to comply with clause (iii) of this
proviso, such Borrower may accept Competitive Bids at the same Competitive Bid
Rate in part, which acceptance, in the case of multiple Competitive Bids at such
Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of
each such Competitive Bid, and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) of this
proviso, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such
Competitive Loan is in a principal amount of $15,000,000 or a larger multiple of
$1,000,000; provided further that if a Competitive Loan must be in an amount
less than $15,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (iv) of the first
proviso of this paragraph, such Competitive Loan may be in an amount of
$1,000,000 or any multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation
of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular
Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to such clause (iv) the amounts shall be rounded
to multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the Company. A notice given
by any Borrower pursuant to this paragraph shall be irrevocable.

          (e) Notification of Acceptances by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender by telecopy
whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if so, the amount and
Competitive Bid Rate so accepted), and each successful bidder will thereupon
become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make the
Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.

          (f) Bids by the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent
shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall
submit such Competitive Bid directly to the respective Borrower at least one
quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the other Lenders are required
to submit their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section.

          (g) Continuing Obligations of Lenders. The extension of any
Competitive Loan by any Lender shall not constitute utilization of such Lender's
Commitment hereunder, and such Lender shall remain obligated (as provided in
Section 2.17(c)) to make Loans in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the
aggregate Commitments under this Agreement, provided that in no event shall the
sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Competitive Loans at any time exceed the total Commitments.

          SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings.

          (a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by
it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the respective
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -23-


funds, to an account maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City
and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or
Competitive Bid Request.

          (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent
such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the respective Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal
Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections.

          (a) Elections by Borrowers for Syndicated Borrowings. Each Syndicated
Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the
Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, a Borrower may
elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to
continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all
as provided in this Section; provided, however, that (i) a Syndicated Borrowing
denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted to, a
Syndicated Borrowing in a different Currency, (ii) no Syndicated Eurocurrency
Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving
effect thereto, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures plus the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans would exceed the aggregate
Commitments, and (iii) a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a
Foreign Currency may not be converted to a Borrowing of a different Type. A
Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
among the Lenders holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans
constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This
Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or
continued.

          (b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section,
a Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone
by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
Company were requesting a Syndicated Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written

Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and
signed by the Company (on behalf of itself or, as applicable, on behalf of an
Approved Borrower).

          (c) Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and
written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:

               (i) the Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest
     Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
     respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated
     to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
     pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for
     each resulting Borrowing);

               (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
     Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars,
     the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency
     Borrowing; and

               (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the
     Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall
     be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"
     and permitted under Section 2.02(d).

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing (whether
denominated in Dollars or a Foreign Currency) but does not specify an Interest
Period, then the respective Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d) Notice by the Administrative Agent to Lenders. Promptly following
receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise
each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each
resulting Borrowing.

          (e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If a Borrower fails to
deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Syndicated
Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then,
unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is
denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall
be converted to an ABR Borrowing, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a
Foreign Currency, the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month's duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrowers, then,
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (A) no outstanding Syndicated
Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, (B) unless repaid, each Syndicated
Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor and (C) no outstanding
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may have an
Interest Period of more than one month's duration.

          SECTION 2.07. Changes of Commitments.

          (a) Scheduled Termination. Unless previously terminated, subject to
Section 2.20, the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall terminate on the
Commitment Termination Date.

          (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Company may at any time
terminate or from time to time reduce the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is $15,000,000 or a
larger multiple of $1,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce
the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the
Syndicated Loans in accordance with Section 2.09, the sum of the total Revolving
Credit Exposures plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive
Loans would exceed the total Commitments.

          (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Company shall
notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days
prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such
election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be
irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered
by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness
of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

          (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction. Any termination or reduction
of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments.

          (e) Increase of Commitments.

          (i) Requests for Increase by Company. The Company may at any time, by
notice to the Administrative Agent, propose that the aggregate amount of the
Commitments hereunder be increased (each such proposed increase being a
"Commitment Increase"), effective as of a date (the "Commitment Increase Date")
that shall be specified in such notice and that shall be prior to the Commitment
Termination Date; provided that

          (A) the Company may not propose more than one Commitment Increase
     during any calendar month,

          (B) the proposed Commitment Increase in respect of the Commitment of
     either (i) any Increasing Lender or (ii) any Assuming Lender for each
     Commitment Increase Date shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or
     a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, provided that the minimum
     amount of the Commitment of any Assuming Lender shall be $20,000,000,

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -26-


          (C) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments
     hereunder, and under the 5-Year Credit Agreement, at any time exceed
     $2,350,000,000,

          (D) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such
     Commitment Increase Date or shall result from the proposed Commitment
     Increase,

          (E) the representations and warranties contained in Article III shall
     be correct on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as
     of such date, and

          (F) immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase, no
     Lender shall hold more than 20% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments.

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of a proposed Commitment
Increase promptly upon its receipt of any notice from the Company with respect
to such proposed Commitment Increase. It shall be in each Lender's sole
discretion whether to increase its Commitment hereunder in connection with any
proposed Commitment Increase. No later than 10 Business Days (or such longer
period as the Company and the Administrative Agent shall agree) after its
receipt of the Company's notice proposing a Commitment Increase, each Lender
that is willing to increase its Commitment hereunder (each such Lender being an
"Increasing Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a notice in which
such Lender shall set forth the maximum increase in its Commitment to which such
Lender is willing to agree, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide
to the Company a copy of such Increasing Lender's notice.

          (ii) Acceptance of Commitment Increase by Company. If agreement is
reached prior to the relevant Commitment Increase Date with any Increasing
Lenders and Assuming Lenders, if any, as to a Commitment Increase (the amount of
which may be less than (subject to the limitation set forth in clause (i)(B) of
this Section 2.07(e)) but not greater than that amount specified in the
applicable notice from the Company), the Company shall deliver, no later than
three Business Days prior to such Commitment Increase Date, a notice thereof in
reasonable detail to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders, including any Assuming Lenders). The
Assuming Lenders, if any, shall become Lenders hereunder as of such Commitment
Increase Date and the Commitments of any Increasing Lenders and such Assuming
Lenders shall be increased as of such Commitment Increase Date; provided that:

          (x) the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 9:00
     a.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date a certificate of
     a duly authorized officer of the Company stating that each of the
     applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in this Section
     2.07(e) has been satisfied;

          (y) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Administrative Agent
     shall have received, on or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such
     Commitment Increase Date, an appropriate Assumption Agreement in
     substantially the form of Exhibit E, duly executed by such Assuming Lender
     and the Company and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent; and

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -27-


          (z) each Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Administrative
     Agent, on or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Commitment
     Increase Date, confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Administrative
     Agent as to its increased Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to
     the Company.

          (iii) Recordation into Register. Upon its receipt of confirmation from
a Lender that it is increasing its Commitment hereunder, together with the
certificate referred to in clause (ii)(x) above, the Administrative Agent shall
(A) record the information contained therein in the Register and (B) give prompt
notice thereof to the Company. Upon its receipt of an Assumption Agreement
executed by an Assuming Lender, together with the certificate referred to in
clause (ii)(x) above, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assumption
Agreement has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit E, (x)
accept such Assumption Agreement, (y) record the information contained therein
in the Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Company.

          (iv) Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase. In the
event that the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company
as to any agreement with respect to a Commitment Increase on or prior to the
relevant Commitment Increase Date and the actions provided for in clauses
(ii)(x) through (ii)(z) above shall have occurred by 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on such Commitment Increase Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify
the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) of the occurrence of such
Commitment Increase Date promptly on such date by facsimile transmission or
electronic messaging system. On the date of such increase, the Borrowers shall
each prepay their respective then outstanding Syndicated Loans (if any) in full,
and shall simultaneously borrow new Syndicated Loans hereunder in an amount
equal to such prepayment, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Syndicated
Loans of the respective Lenders to each Borrower are held ratably by the Lenders
in accordance with their respective Commitments (after giving effect to such
Commitment Increases).

          SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

          (a) Repayment. Subject to Section 2.19, each Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay the Loans as follows:

          (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders the
     outstanding principal amount of the Syndicated Loans on the Commitment
     Termination Date, and

          (ii) to the Administrative Agent for account of the respective Lender
     the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan of such Lender on
     the last day of the Interest Period therefor.

          (b) Manner of Payment. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any
Borrowings hereunder, the respective Borrower shall select the Borrowing or
Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment;
provided that each repayment of Borrowings shall be applied to repay any
outstanding ABR Borrowings before any other Borrowings. If a Borrower fails to

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -28-


make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid,
such payment shall be applied, first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of
such Borrower and, second, to other Borrowings of such Borrower in the order of
the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with
the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first), and for these
purposes, Competitive Loans shall be deemed to be in the same Class as
Syndicated Loans. Each payment of a Syndicated Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.

          (c) Maintenance of Loan Accounts by Lenders. Each Lender shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made
by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (d) Maintenance of Loan Accounts by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the
amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and
each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender's
share thereof.

          (e) Effect of Entries. The entries made in the accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence
of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that
the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts
or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of a Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (f) Promissory Notes. Any Lender may request that Loans made by it to
a Borrower be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, such Borrower shall
prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the
order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its
registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon
shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be
represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of
the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to
such payee and its registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.09. Prepayment of Loans.

          (a) Optional Prepayments. Each Borrower shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing made to it in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section; provided that no Borrower
shall have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior consent of
the Lender thereof.

          (b) Mandatory Prepayments.

          (i) Determination of Amount Outstanding. On each Quarterly Date and
     promptly upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Currency
     Valuation Notice (as defined below), the Administrative Agent shall
     determine the sum of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure plus the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Competitive Loans. For the
     purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan
     that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the
     Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan,
     determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the case of a Currency
     Valuation Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m.,
     New York City time, on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case
     of a Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, on the first Business
     Day after such Currency Valuation Notice is received. Upon making such
     determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders
     and the Company thereof.

          (ii) Prepayment. If, on the date of such determination such sum
     exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments as then in effect,
     the Borrowers shall, if requested by the Required Lenders (through the
     Administrative Agent), prepay the Syndicated Loans and Competitive Loans in
     such amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto the
     sum of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure plus the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of all Competitive Loans does not exceed the
     Commitments.

For purposes hereof, "Currency Valuation Notice" means a notice given by the
Required Lenders to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice is a
"Currency Valuation Notice" and requesting that the Administrative Agent
determine the sum of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure plus the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Competitive Loans. The Administrative Agent
shall not be required to make more than one valuation determination pursuant to
Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling three month period. Any prepayment
pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied, first, to Syndicated Loans
outstanding and second, to Competitive Loans outstanding.

          (c) Notices, Etc. Each Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent
by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any optional prepayment to be made by it
hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing
or of a Competitive Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time
(or, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, 11:00 a.m.,
London time), two Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the
case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a
notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.07, then such notice
of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following receipt of any such notice
relating to a Syndicated Borrowing or

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -30-


Competitive Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the relevant
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall
be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same
Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Syndicated
Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid
Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
required by Section 2.11 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section
2.08(b).

          SECTION 2.10. Fees.

          (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the earlier of the date such Commitment terminates and the Commitment
Termination Date; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving
Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall
continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit
Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but
excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit
Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable on each Quarterly Date and on
the earlier of the date the Commitments terminate and the Commitment Termination
Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided
that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (b) Administrative Agent Fees. The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative
Agent.

          (c) Payment of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the
dates due, in Dollars and immediately available funds, to the Administrative
Agent for distribution, in the case of facility fees, to the Lenders entitled
thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.11. Interest.

          (a) ABR Loans. The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

          (b) Eurocurrency Loans. The Loans constituting each Eurocurrency
Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of a
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for the
Interest Period for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate, or (ii) in the case
of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest
Period for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable
to such Loan.

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -31-


          (c) Fixed Rate Loans. Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.

          (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal
of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by a Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration,
by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case
of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such
Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

          (e) Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case
of Syndicated Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i)
interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on
demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than
a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Commitment Termination Date), accrued
interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars prior to the end of the
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on
the effective date of such conversion.

          (f) Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest in respect of Eurocurrency
Borrowings denominated in English Pounds Sterling shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) interest computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is
based on the base rate of Citibank shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year); interest shall in each case be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or
Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing (the Currency of such
Borrowing herein called the "Affected Currency"):

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate (in the case of a
     Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing) or the Eurocurrency Rate (in the case of
     a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing) for the Affected Currency for such
     Interest Period; or

          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
     in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing, any Lender that is
     required to make such Loan) that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate (in the
     case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing) or the Eurocurrency Rate (in
     the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing) for the Affected Currency
     for such Interest Period will not adequately and

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -32-


     fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or
     maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such
     Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Syndicated Borrowing to, or
the continuation of any Syndicated Borrowing as, a Syndicated Eurocurrency
Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be ineffective and, if the
Affected Currency is Dollars, such Syndicated Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall
be continued as, or converted to, an ABR Borrowing, (ii) if the Affected
Currency is Dollars and any Borrowing Request requests a Syndicated Eurocurrency
Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing, (iii) if the Affected Currency is a Foreign Currency, any Borrowing
Request that requests a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the
Affected Currency shall be ineffective and (iv) any request by a Borrower for a
Competitive Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be
ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by a Borrower for Competitive
Eurocurrency Borrowings denominated in the Affected Currency may be made to
Lenders that are not affected thereby, and (b) the provisions of this Section
shall not apply to any determination of the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or the
Eurocurrency Rate (as the case may be) for the Interest Period for any
Eurocurrency Borrowing if the applicable Eurocurrency Rate is available on the
Screen as contemplated by the first sentence of the definition of "Eurocurrency
Rate".

          SECTION 2.13. Increased Costs.

          (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or
     credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate); or

          (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans or Fixed Rate
     Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lenders of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan to any
Borrower (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether
of principal, interest or otherwise), then the respective Borrower will pay to
such Lender, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in
Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of

                                      -33-


this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such
Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change
in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of
such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time
to time the Company will pay to such Lender, in Dollars, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for
any such reduction suffered.

          (c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender setting forth
the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section, and setting forth calculations of such amount or amounts, shall be
delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
respective Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that no Borrower shall
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such
Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          (e) Competitive Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this
Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would
otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced
prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

          SECTION 2.14. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan of any Borrower
other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result
of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan
of any Borrower other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c)
the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan of any
Borrower on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section
2.09(c) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the failure by any Borrower
to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such
Loan, (e) the assignment of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
of any Borrower other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor as a
result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.18 or (f) any repayment
of all or any portion of any Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor as a result of a
request by the Company for a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.07(e) and
a resulting adjustment of outstanding Borrowings as between Lenders under
paragraph (iv) of said Section, then, in any such event,

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -34-


such Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event.

          In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender
attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined
by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such
Loan denominated in the Currency of such Loan for the period from the date of
such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have
resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate
payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such
Currency (in the case of a Syndicated Eurocurrency Loan) or the Eurocurrency
Rate for such Currency (in the case of a Competitive Eurocurrency Loan) for such
Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on
such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such
Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in such
Currency from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such
period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The respective
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.15. U.S. Taxes.

          (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. In addition, each
Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

          (c) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -35-


the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Foreign Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the United
States of America, or any treaty to which the United States of America is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement by any Borrower shall
deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments by such Borrower to be made without withholding or at
a reduced rate.

          SECTION 2.16. Foreign Taxes.

          (a) Payments to be Made Free and Clear of Foreign Taxes. All payments
on account of the principal of and interest on the Loans, fees and all other
amounts payable hereunder by any Approved Borrower organized under a Foreign
Jurisdiction to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
including amounts payable under paragraph (b) of this Section, shall be made
free and clear of and without reduction or liability for Foreign Taxes. Such
Approved Borrower will pay all Foreign Taxes applicable to it, without charge to
or offset against any amount due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, except for any such Foreign
Taxes (other than Foreign Taxes imposed on or in respect of any amount payable
by such Approved Borrower hereunder) the payment of which is being contested in
good faith and by proper proceedings and against which adequate reserves are
being maintained, so long as no claim for such Foreign Taxes is made on the
Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          (b) Indemnification by Approved Borrowers. Each Approved Borrower
organized under a Foreign Jurisdiction shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender against, and reimburse the Administrative Agent and each Lender
on demand for, any Foreign Taxes applicable to it and any loss, liability, claim
or expense, including interest, penalties and legal fees, that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender may incur at any time arising out of or in
connection with any failure of such Approved Borrower to make any payment of
Foreign Taxes when due.

          (c) Gross-Up for Foreign Taxes. In the event that any Approved
Borrower organized under a Foreign Jurisdiction is required by applicable law,
decree or regulation to deduct or withhold Foreign Taxes from any amounts
payable on, under or in respect of this Agreement or the Loans made to it, such
Approved Borrower shall (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law)
promptly pay the Person entitled to such amount such additional amounts as may
be required, after the deduction or withholding of Foreign Taxes, to enable such

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -36-


Person to receive from such Approved Borrower on the due date thereof, an amount
equal to the full amount stated to be payable to such Person under this
Agreement. Each Lender shall provide to such Approved Borrower such forms or
certificates as such Approved Borrower may reasonably request to establish such
Lender's entitlement to an exemption from or reduction of Foreign Taxes, but no
Lender shall be required to provide any form or certificate if it determines in
its discretion that the provision of such form or certificate could adversely
affect it or it is not legally entitled to provide such form or certificate.

          (d) Evidence of Payment of Foreign Taxes. Each Approved Borrower
organized under a Foreign Jurisdiction shall furnish to the Administrative
Agent, upon the request of any Lender (through the Administrative Agent),
together with sufficient certified copies for distribution to each Lender
requesting the same (identifying the Lenders that have so requested), original
official tax receipts (or certified copies thereof) in respect of each payment
of Foreign Taxes required under this Section made by such Approved Borrower or
such other information, documents and receipts that the Administrative Agent or
such Lender may reasonably require to establish to its satisfaction that full
and timely payment has been made of all Foreign Taxes required to be paid under
this Section within 30 days after the date such payment is made.

          SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs.

          (a) Payments by the Borrowers. Each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or
under Section 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Local
Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off,
counterclaim or other deduction. Any amounts received after such time on any
date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at
the Administrative Agent's Account, except that payments pursuant to Sections
2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by
it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that
is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder (including facility fees, payments required under Section 2.13, and
payments required under Section 2.14 relating to any Loan denominated in
Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated
in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under
Section 2.14, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) shall be made in
Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Borrower shall fail to pay any
principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by
mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if
such Loan is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in
Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the
last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest
Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such
redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if any
Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in
Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the
due

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -37-


date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount
equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and
such interest shall be payable on demand.

          (b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient
funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal then due to such parties.

          (c) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (i) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each
payment of a facility fee under Section 2.10 shall be made for account of the
Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments
under Section 2.07 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the
Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or,
in the case of payment of facility fees, pro rata according to the amounts of
their respective Revolving Credit Exposures); (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing
shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their
respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their
respective Loans (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii)
each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans by any Borrower
shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the
respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Borrower
held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans by any
Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with
the amounts of interest on such Loans of such Borrower then due and payable to
the respective Lenders.

          (d) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising
any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of
any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its
Syndicated Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion
received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion
shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans
of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated
Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph
shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -38-


against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

          (e) Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that the
respective Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders
the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

          (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender
shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section
2.05(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such
Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations
are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

          (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.13, 2.15 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would
not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any
such designation or assignment.

          (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.15 or 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans
hereunder, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to
such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an
assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -39-


have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its
Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a
waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

          SECTION 2.19. Term-Out Option. If the Commitment Termination Date
shall not have been extended pursuant to the terms of Section 2.20, the Company
may, by notice to the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify the
Lenders, not later than 15 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, extend
the Maturity Date for all Loans (other than any Competitive Loans) outstanding
at the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date to the first
anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date; provided that such extension
shall not be effective unless:

          (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on each of the
     date of the notice requesting such extension and on the Commitment
     Termination Date; and

          (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company in Part A of
     Article III (other than the last sentence of Section 3.02) shall be true
     and complete on and as of each of the date of the notice requesting the
     such extension and on the Commitment Termination Date with the same force
     and effect as if made on and as of such date.

Upon giving effect to such extension, the Commitments of the Lenders to make
Loans shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.

          SECTION 2.20. Extension of Commitment Termination Date.

          (a) Requests for Extension. The Company may, by notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than
60 days and not later than 45 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date then
in effect hereunder (the "Existing Commitment Termination Date"), request that
each Lender extend such Lender's Commitment Termination Date for an additional
364 days from the Existing Commitment Termination Date.

          (b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and
individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not
earlier than 45 days prior to the Existing Commitment Termination Date and not
later than the date (the "Notice Date") that is 30 days prior to the Existing
Commitment Termination Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such
Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so
extend its Commitment Termination Date (a "Non-Extending Lender") shall notify
the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the other Lenders) of such fact
promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice
Date)) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or
before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The
election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other
Lender to so agree. The

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -40-


Commitments of each Non-Extending Lender shall be terminated on the Existing
Commitment Termination Date unless such Non-Extending Lender is replaced
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.

          (c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Company of each Lender's determination under this Section 2.20
no later than the date 25 days prior to the Existing Commitment Termination Date
(or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).

          (d) Additional Commitment Lenders. The Company shall have the right on
or before the Existing Commitment Termination Date to replace each Non-Extending
Lender with, and add as "Lenders" under this Agreement in place thereof, one or
more additional lenders (each, an "Additional Commitment Lender") with the
approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into
an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the
Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall,
effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date, undertake a Commitment
(and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its
Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender's Commitment hereunder on such
date), provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not replace
any Non-Extending Lender with an Additional Commitment Lender not already a
Lender hereunder unless the Company shall first have offered to the existing
Lenders the right to increase their Commitments hereunder to replace the
Commitment of the Non-Extending Lender.

          (e) Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the
Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed so to extend their Commitment
Termination Date and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment
Lenders shall be not less than 51% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in
effect immediately prior to the Existing Commitment Termination Date, then,
effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date, the Commitment
Termination Date of each Lender that has agreed so to extend its Commitment
Termination Date and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to
the date falling 364 days after the Existing Commitment Termination Date (except
that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Commitment Date as so extended
shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender
shall thereupon become a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement.

          (f) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the extension of the Commitment Termination Date pursuant to this
Section 2.20 shall not be effective unless:

          (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing on the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto;

          (ii) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
     are true and correct on and as of the date of such extension and after
     giving effect thereto, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any
     such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of
     a specific date, as of such specific date); and

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -41-


          (iii) on or before the Commitment Termination Date of each
     Non-Extending Lender, (x) the Company shall have paid in full the principal
     of and interest on all of the Loans made by such Non-Extending Lender to
     the Company and to Approved Borrowers hereunder; and (y) the Company shall
     have paid in full all other amounts owing to such Lender hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Representations and Warranties. Each of the Company and the Approved
Borrowers, as applicable, represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

          SECTION 3.01. Corporate Existence. Each of the Company and its
Material Subsidiaries: (a) is a corporation duly organized and validly existing

Material Subsidiary that is not a corporation, is a partnership or other entity
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization); (b) has all requisite legal power, and has all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to own
its assets and carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be

the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2000 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flow and common shareholders'

earnings and cash flow of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the
nine-month period ended on said date, in each case heretofore furnished to each

financial condition of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at said
dates and the consolidated results of their operations for the fiscal year, and
nine-month period ended on said dates (subject, in the case of such financial
statements as at September 30, 2001, to normal year-end audit adjustments), all

Subsidiaries had on said dates any material contingent liabilities, liabilities
for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated
losses from any unfavorable commitments, except as referred to or reflected or
provided for in said balance sheets as at said dates. Since September 30, 2001,
there has been no event or condition that could result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

and proceedings by or before any

Governmental Authority, now pending or (to the knowledge of the Company)
threatened against the Company and/or any of its Material Subsidiaries will not,
in the opinion of the General Counsel of the Company, result in imposition of
liability or assessment against (including seizure of) property that would
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.04. No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in
a breach of, or require any consent under, the charter or by-laws of the
Company, or any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Authority, or any agreement or instrument to which
the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound or to which any of them is subject, or constitute a default under
any such agreement or instrument.

          SECTION 3.05. Corporate Action of the Company. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement; the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on its part; and this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
may be limited by equitable principles or by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors'
rights generally.

          SECTION 3.06. Approvals. No authorizations, approvals or consents of,
and no filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary
for the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or
for the validity or enforceability thereof.

          SECTION 3.07. Use of Loans. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in
the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental
or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin Stock and no part of the proceeds of
any Loan hereunder will be used to buy or carry, or to extend credit to others
to buy or carry, any Margin Stock.

          SECTION 3.08. ERISA. The Company and the ERISA Affiliates have
fulfilled their respective obligations under the minimum funding standards of
ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all
material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Code, and have not incurred any liability to the PBGC or any Plan or
Multiemployer Plan (other than to make contributions in the ordinary course of
business).

          SECTION 3.09. Taxes. United States Federal income tax returns of the
Company have been examined and closed through the fiscal year of the Company
ended December 31, 1994. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns required to
be filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or
pursuant to any assessment received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
except for those being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves
have been established in accordance with GAAP. The charges, accruals and
reserves on

                                      -43-


the books of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries in respect of taxes and
other governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Company, adequate. If the
Company is a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing consolidated
returns for United States Federal income tax purposes, it is the "common parent"
of such group.

          SECTION 3.10. Investment Company Act. None of the Company or any of
the Approved Borrowers is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by
an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

          SECTION 3.11. Public Utility Holding Company Act. None of the Company
or any of the Approved Borrowers is a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a
"holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          SECTION 3.12. Credit Agreements. Schedule II is a complete and correct
list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each credit agreement, loan
agreement, indenture, purchase agreement, guarantee or other arrangement
providing for or otherwise relating to any Indebtedness or any extension of
credit (or commitment for any extension of credit) to, or guarantee by, the
Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries the aggregate principal or face
amount of which equals or exceeds (or may equal or exceed) $150,000,000 and the
aggregate principal or face amount outstanding or which may become outstanding
under each such arrangement is correctly described in Schedule II.

          SECTION 3.13. Hazardous Materials and Environmental Matters.

          (a) Licenses and Permits, Etc. The Company and each of its Material
Subsidiaries have obtained all permits, licenses and other authorizations
required under all Environmental Laws, except to the extent failure to have any
such permit, license or authorization could not in the aggregate reduce by more
than 25% the annual tonnage capacity of the paper processing operations of the
Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its Material
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such
permits, licenses and authorizations, and are also in compliance with all other
limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements,
obligations, schedules and timetables contained in any applicable Environmental
Law or in any regulation, code, plan, order, decree, judgment, injunction,
notice or demand letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder,
except to the extent failure to comply could not in the aggregate reduce by more
than 25% the annual tonnage capacity of the paper processing operations of the
Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

          (b) Compliance Review. In the ordinary course of its business, the
Company conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business, operations and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the
course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs
(including any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or
closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating
expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental
protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or
contract, any related constraints on operating activities, including any
periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility

or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted
thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes
or hazardous substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third
parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis
of this review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated
liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental
Laws, are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.14. Full Disclosure. The Company has heretofore furnished to
each of the Lenders a true copy of (i) the Company's annual report to
shareholders for 2000 setting forth consolidated audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2000, (ii) the Company's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 and (iii) the Company's
report on Form 10-K/A, dated as of January 16, 2002, in each case, as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as disclosed in writing to the
Lenders, the annual, quarterly and other periodic reports most recently
delivered to the Lenders pursuant to this Section or Section 3.02 do not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

          Part B. Representations and Warranties of the Approved Borrowers. Each
Approved Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

          SECTION 3.15. Existence of Approved Borrowers. It (a) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation; (b) has all requisite power, and has all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to own its assets and
carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted; and (c) is
qualified to do business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure so
to qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.16. No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of its
Designation Letter, the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in
a breach of, or require any consent under, the charter or by-laws of such
Approved Borrower, or any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority, or any agreement or
instrument to which such Approved Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of them is bound or to which any of them is subject, or
constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument.

          SECTION 3.17. Corporate Action. Such Approved Borrower has all
necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under its Designation Letter and to perform its obligations hereunder; the
execution and delivery by such Approved Borrower of its Designation Letter and
the performance by such Approved Borrower hereunder and thereunder have been
duly authorized by all necessary action on its part; and its Designation Letter
when executed and delivered by such Approved Borrower, will constitute, the
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Approved Borrower, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

          SECTION 3.18. Approvals. No authorizations, approvals or consents of,
and no filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary
for the execution,

delivery or performance by such Approved Borrower of its Designation Letter or
for the validity or enforceability thereof.

          SECTION 3.19. Taxes on Payments of Approved Borrowers. Except as
disclosed to the Lenders in writing prior to the delivery of such Approved
Borrower's Designation Letter, there is no income, stamp or other tax of any
country, or of any taxing authority thereof or therein, imposed by or in the
nature of withholding or otherwise, which is imposed on any payment to be made
by such Approved Borrower pursuant hereto, or is imposed on or by virtue of the
execution, delivery or enforcement of its Designation Letter.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    GUARANTEE

          SECTION 4.01. Guarantee. The Guarantor hereby guarantees to each
Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns
the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the Lenders
to any Approved Borrower and all other amounts from time to time owing to the
Lenders or the Administrative Agent by any Approved Borrower under this
Agreement pursuant to its Designation Letter, in each case strictly in
accordance with the terms thereof (such obligations being herein collectively
called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Guarantor hereby further agrees that
if any Approved Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the
Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever,
and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due
(whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with
the terms of such extension or renewal.

          SECTION 4.02. Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the
Guarantor under Section 4.01 are absolute and unconditional irrespective of the
value, genuineness, validity, regularity, legality or enforceability of the
obligations of any Approved Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement
or instrument referred to herein or therein (including any Designation Letter),
or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security
for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor (including any immunity, sovereign or otherwise, to which any Approved
Borrower may be entitled), it being the intent of this Section that the
obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under
any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it
is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not
affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder:

          (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantor,
     the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be
     waived;

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -46-


          (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this
     Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
     therein shall be done or omitted; or

          (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
     accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified,
     supplemented, or amended in any respect, or any right under this Agreement
     or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be
     waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
     security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or
     otherwise dealt with.

The Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any
Approved Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other Person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

          SECTION 4.03. Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantor under
this Article IV shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Approved Borrower in respect of
the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any
holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise and the Guarantor
agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration.

          SECTION 4.04. Subrogation. The Guarantor hereby waives all rights of
subrogation or contribution, whether arising by operation of law (including any
such right arising under the Bankruptcy Code, as now or hereafter in effect) or
otherwise, by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV and further agrees that for the benefit of each of its creditors
(including each Lender and the Administrative Agent) that any such payment by it
of the Guaranteed Obligations of any Approved Borrower shall constitute a
contribution of capital by the Guarantor to such Approved Borrower or, if
evidenced by an instrument in form and substance (and containing terms of
subordination) satisfactory to the Required Lenders, indebtedness subordinated
in right of payment to the principal of and interest (including post-petition
interest) on the Loans owing by such Approved Borrower.

          SECTION 4.05. Remedies. The Guarantor agrees that, as between the
Guarantor and the Lenders, the obligations of any Approved Borrower under this
Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article
VII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in Article VII) for purposes of Section 4.01
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as
against any Approved Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or
such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable),
such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Approved Borrower)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for purposes of said
Section 4.01.

     Agent may reasonably request (on its own behalf or on behalf of any
     Lender).

     The Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at the time it
furnishes each set of financial statements pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b)
above, a certificate of a senior financial officer of the Company (i) to the

cause each of its Material Subsidiaries to: preserve and maintain its legal
existence and all of its material rights, privileges and franchises (provided
that nothing in this Section shall prohibit any transaction expressly permitted
under Section 6.06); comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority if failure to comply with
such requirements (i) will in the opinion of the General Counsel of the Company
result in imposition of liability or assessment against (including seizure of)
property in an aggregate amount (as to all such failures to comply) exceeding

imposed on it or on its income or profits or on any of its property prior to the

proper proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained;
maintain all of its properties used or useful in its business in good working
order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted; provided, however, that
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company may discontinue the maintenance of
a property if such discontinuance is, in the opinion of the Company, desirable
in the conduct of its business and is not likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect; and upon reasonable advance notice, permit representatives of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent, during normal business hours, to examine, copy and
make extracts from its books and records, to inspect its properties, and to
discuss its business and affairs with its officers, all to the extent reasonably

circumstances.

          SECTION 6.05. Use of Proceeds. The Company will, and will cause each
Approved Borrower to, use the proceeds of the Loans made to it hereunder solely
for its general corporate purposes (in compliance with all applicable legal and
regulatory requirements), including acquisition financing and commercial paper

lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, all or a substantial part of its business or assets, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired (excluding any inventory or other assets sold or

     or otherwise) to the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company;

          (c) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company may merge or
     consolidate with any other Person if (i) in the case of a merger or
     consolidation of the Company, any successor entity (if other than Company)
     assumes, in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, all of the
     Company's obligations under this Agreement (and, in that connection,
     delivers to the Administrative Agent such evidence of corporate
     authorization and opinions of counsel as are consistent with those
     delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5.01 on the Effective Date and
     are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent) and, in the case of a
     merger or consolidation of any Subsidiary, the surviving corporation is a
     Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) after giving effect thereto
     no Default would exist hereunder; and

          (d) in addition to the dispositions permitted pursuant to clauses (a)
     through (c) of this Section, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company

     Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in accordance with GAAP;

          (b) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', materialmen's, repairmen's

     materially detract from the value of the property subject thereto or
     interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Company or any
     of its Material Subsidiaries;

          (f) Liens on assets of Persons that become Subsidiaries of the Company

connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any
other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and

exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the
Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made
by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each
Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
paragraph). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

          (a) if to the Company, to it at Office of the Assistant Treasurer -
     Domestic, International Paper Company, 400 Atlantic Street, Stamford,
     Connecticut 06921, Attention: Rosemarie A. Loffredo (Telecopy No. (203)
     541-8263; Telephone No. (203) 541-8584);

          (b) if to the Administrative Agent, to Citibank, Two Penn's Way, Suite
     200, New Castle, Delaware 19720, Attention of Jason Trala (Telecopy No.
     (302) 894-6120; Telephone No. (302) 894-6086); and

          (c) if to a Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number) set
     forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto (or, in the case
of any such change by a Lender, by notice to the Company and the Administrative
Agent). All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt. Each Approved Borrower hereby agrees that any
notice or other communication provided for herein to be given by or to such
Approved Borrower may be given by or to the Company on behalf of such Approved
Borrower in the manner specified above and neither the Administrative Agent nor
any Lender shall be required to accept as effective any notice or other
communication purporting to have been issued directly by an Approved Borrower
(and not by the Company on behalf of such Approved Borrower).

          SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments.

          (a) No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Obligor
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not
be construed as a

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -61-


waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

          (b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by each Obligor and the Required Lenders or by each Obligor
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall

          (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent
     of such Lender,

          (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of
     interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written
     consent of each Lender affected thereby,

          (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount
     of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or
     reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
     scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent
     of each Lender affected thereby,

          (iv) alter the manner in which payments or prepayments of principal,
     interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders
     or Types or Classes of Loans, without the written consent of each Lender,
     or

          (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage in
     the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
     specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
     modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
     hereunder or release the Guarantor's obligations in respect of any Approved
     Borrower, without the written consent of each Lender;

and provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

          (a) Costs and Expenses. The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made
hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect thereof.

<PAGE>


                                      -62-


          (b) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or
alleged presence or release of hazardous materials on or from any property owned
or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any environmental
liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv)
any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Company fails to
pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

          (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, no Obligor shall assert, and hereby waives, any claim against
any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential
or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby, any Loan
or the use of the proceeds thereof.

          (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns.

          (a) Assignments Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Obligor may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any
Obligor without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                      -63-


          (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it); provided that

          (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of
     a Lender, each of the Company and the Administrative Agent must give their
     prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld or delayed),

          (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
     of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
     assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the
     assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date
     the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
     to the Administrative Agent) shall be not less than $10,000,000 or a larger
     multiple of $1,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative
     Agent otherwise consent,

          (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to
     rights in respect of outstanding Competitive Loans,

          (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that no Borrower shall
     be obligated to pay any such fee upon any such assignment), and

          (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;

provided further that any consent of the Company otherwise required under this
paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (f) or
(g) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Upon acceptance and recording
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
(a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"),
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the
Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all
or any part of any Loan that such Granting

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -64-


Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by
any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option
or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank
shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of
a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to
the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each
party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or
similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall
remain with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness
of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in
instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 9.04, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior
written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying
any processing fee therefor, (x) assign all or any portion of its interest in
any Loans to the Granting Bank and (y) pledge all or a portion of its interests
in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (consented to
by the Company and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit
support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance
of Loans (and assign to the Granting Bank and to any such financial institution
any such Loans upon a realization in respect of such pledge or in connection
with the performance by such financial institution of its liquidity or credit
support obligations) and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer
or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such
SPC, subject to the requirements of Section 9.12(b)(vi).

          (c) Maintenance of Register by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers,
shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d) Effectiveness of Assignments. Upon its receipt of a duly completed
Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept
such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -65-


contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes
of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
this paragraph.

          (e) Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent of any
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks
or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the respective Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section,
each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section.

          (f) Limitations on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.15 or 2.16 than
the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the respective Borrower's prior written consent. A
Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Borrowers are notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.15(e) as though it were a
Lender.

          (g) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          (h) No Assignments to the Borrowers or Affiliates. Anything in this
Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any
interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to any Borrower or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender.

          SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by any Obligor herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -66-


behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall
survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

          SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the
obligations of such Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held
by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.

          (a) Governing Law. This Agreement and each Designation Letter shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

          (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -67-


Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent
or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement against any Obligor or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

          (c) Waiver of Venue. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

          (d) Service of Process. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section

          SECTION 9.12. Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.

          (a) Treatment of Certain Information. Each Obligor acknowledges that
from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may
be offered or provided to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more
subsidiaries or affiliates of such Lender and each Obligor hereby authorizes
each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by the Company and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision
of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or
affiliate, it being understood that any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving
such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

          (b) Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party
to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this paragraph, to any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, (vii) with the consent of the
Company or (viii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this paragraph or (B) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Company. For the purposes of this paragraph, "Information" means
all information received from any Obligor relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or their business), other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by such Obligor; provided that, in the case of information
received from an Obligor after the date hereof, such information is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

          SECTION 9.13. European Monetary Union.

          (a) Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

          "EMU" means economic and monetary union as contemplated in the Treaty
     on European Union.

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -69-


          "EMU Legislation" means legislative measures of the European Council
     for the introduction of, changeover to or operation of a single or unified
     European currency (whether known as the euro or otherwise), being in part
     the implementation of the third stage of EMU.

          "Euros" means the single currency of Participating Member States of
     the European Union, which shall be an Agreed Foreign Currency and a Foreign
     Currency under this Agreement.

          "National Currency" means the Currency, other than the Euro, of a
     Participating Member State.

          "Participating Member State" means each state so described in any EMU
     Legislation.

          "Target Operating Day" means any day that is not (i) a Saturday or
     Sunday, (ii) Christmas Day or New Year's Day or (iii) any other day on
     which the Trans-European Real-time Gross Settlement Operating System (or
     any successor settlement system) is not operating (as determined by the
     Administrative Agent).

          "Treaty on European Union" means the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957,
     as amended by the Single European Act 1986 and the Maastricht Treaty (which
     was signed at Maastricht on February 7, 1992, and came into force on
     November 1, 1993), as amended from time to time.

          (b) Effectiveness of Provisions. The provisions of paragraphs (c)
through (h) of this Section shall be effective on the date hereof, provided
that, if and to the extent that any such provision relates to any state (or the
Currency of such state) that is not a Participating Member State on the date
hereof, such provision shall become effective in relation to such state (and
such Currency) at and from the date on which such state becomes a Participating
Member State.

          (c) Redenomination and Alternative Currencies. Each obligation under
this Agreement of a party to this Agreement which has been denominated in the
National Currency of a state that is not a Participating Member State on the
date hereof shall, effective upon the date on which such state becomes a
Participating Member State, be redenominated in Euros in accordance with EMU
Legislation; provided that, if and to the extent that any EMU Legislation
provides that an amount denominated either in Euros or in the National Currency
of a Participating Member State and payable within the Participating Member
State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either
in Euros or in such National Currency, any party to this Agreement shall be
entitled to pay or repay any such amount either in Euros or in such National
Currency.

          (d) Payments by the Administrative Agent Generally. With respect to
the payment of any amount denominated in Euros or in a National Currency, the
Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any Borrower or any of the Lenders
in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the
crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by
the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have

                            364-Day Credit Agreement




<PAGE>


                                      -70-


taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the
payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared
funds (in Euros or in such National Currency, as the case may be) to the account
of any Lender in the Principal Financial Center in the Participating Member
State which such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have
specified for such purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, "all relevant
steps" means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the
regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the
Administrative Agent may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing
or settling payments in Euros or such National Currency.

          (e) Certain Rate Determinations. For the purposes of determining the
date on which the Eurocurrency Rate is determined under this Agreement for the
Interest Period for any Borrowing denominated in Euros (or in any National
Currency), references in this Agreement to Business Days shall be deemed to be
references to Target Operating Days. In addition, if the Administrative Agent
determines, with respect to the Interest Period for any Borrowing denominated in
a National Currency, that there is no IBOR displayed on the Screen for deposits
denominated in such National Currency, the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest
Period shall be based upon IBOR displayed on the Screen for the offering of
deposits denominated in Euros.

          (f) Basis of Accrual. If the basis of accrual of interest or fees
expressed in this Agreement with respect to the Currency of any state that
becomes a Participating Member State shall be inconsistent with any convention
or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees
in respect of the Euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed
basis effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a
Participating Member State; provided that, with respect to any Borrowing
denominated in such Currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date,
such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor.

          (g) Rounding. Without prejudice and in addition to any method of
conversion or rounding prescribed by the EMU Legislation, each reference in this
Agreement to a minimum amount, or to a multiple of a specified amount, in a
National Currency to be paid to or by the Administrative Agent shall be replaced
by a reference to such reasonably comparable and convenient amount, or to a
multiple of such reasonably comparable and convenient amount, in Euros as the
Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify.

          (h) Other Consequential Changes. Without prejudice to the respective
liabilities of any Borrower to the Lenders and the Lenders to any Borrower under
or pursuant to this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section,
each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of
construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably
specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction of or
changeover to the Euro in Participating Member States.

          SECTION 9.14. Judgment Currency. This is an international loan
transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as
the case may be (the "Specified Currency"), and payment in New York City or the
country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Place"),
is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account
in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The
payment obligations of the Obligors under this Agreement shall not be discharged
or satisfied by

                            364-Day Credit Agreement

                                      -71-


an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to
the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking
procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified
Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another
currency (the "Second Currency"), the rate of exchange that shall be applied
shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second
Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is
rendered. The obligation of any Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (in this Section called an
"Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied
in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be
due hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with
normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the
Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due;
and such Obligor hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such
Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by
which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency
hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and
transferred.
