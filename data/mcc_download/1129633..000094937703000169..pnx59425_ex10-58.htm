be paid to your estate.

            (b) <i>Assignment by You</i>. You may not assign this Agreement without the Holding Company and Insurance
Company's consent. Also, except as required by law, your right to receive payments or benefits under this
Agreement may not be subject to execution, attachment, levy or similar process. Any attempt to effect any of
the preceding in violation of this Section 8[b], whether voluntary or involuntary, will be void.

            (c) <i>Assumption by any Successor Company</i>. The Holding Company and the Insurance Company will require
any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Holding Company or Insurance Company to unconditionally
assume this Agreement in writing and will provide a copy of the assumption to you. On such assumption, the
successor company will be treated for all purposes as the Holding Company or the Insurance Company (as the case
may be) under this Agreement.

<b>9. Disputes.</b>

            (a) <i>Employment Matter</i>. This Section 9 applies to any controversy or claim between you and any
member of the Group arising out of or relating to or concerning this Agreement or any aspect of your employment
with the Group or the termination of that employment (together, an "Employment Matter").

            (b) <b><i>Mandatory Arbitration</i>. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, any Employment Matter will
be finally settled by arbitration in Hartford County, Connecticut administered by the American Arbitration
Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect.</b> However, the rules will be

modified to provide that each arbitrator will agree to treat as confidential the evidence and other information
presented to the same extent as the information is required to be kept confidential under Section 7[h].

            (c) <i>Injunctions and Enforcement of Arbitration Awards</i>. You or the Group may bring an action or
special proceeding in any state or federal court located in Hartford County, Connecticut to compel arbitration
or to enforce any arbitration award under Section 9[b]. Also, the Group may bring such an action or proceeding,
in addition to its rights under Section 9[b] and whether or not an arbitration proceeding has been or is ever
initiated, to temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enforce any part of Section 7. You agree that (1) your
violating any part of Section 7 would cause damage to the Group that cannot be measured or repaired, (2) the
Group therefore is entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief restraining any
actual or threatened violation of that Section, (3) no bond will need to be posted for the Group to receive
such an injunction, order or other relief and (4) no proof will be required that monetary damages for
violations of that Section would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate.

            (d) <b><i>Jurisdiction and Choice of Forum</i>. You and the Group irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in Hartford County, Connecticut over any non-arbitral matter
relating to an Employment Matter, including any action or proceeding to compel arbitration or to enforce an
arbitration award.</b> Both you and the Group (1) acknowledge that the forum stated in this Section 9[d] has a
reasonable relation to this Agreement and to the relationship between you and the Group and that the submission
to the forum will apply even if the forum chooses to apply non-forum law, (2) waive, to the extent permitted by
law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding covered by
this Section 9[d] in the forum stated in this Section, (3) agree not to commence any such action or proceeding
in any forum other than the forum stated in this Section 9[d] and (4) agree that, to the extent permitted by
law, a final and non-appealable judgment in any such action or proceeding in any such court will be conclusive
and binding on you and the Group. However, nothing in this Agreement precludes you or the Group from bringing
any action or proceeding in any court for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Sections 10[b] and this
10[d].

            (e) <b><i>Waiver of Jury Trial</i>. To the extent permitted by law, you and the Group waive any and all
rights to a jury trial with respect to any matter.</b>

            (f) <b><i>Governing Law</i>. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of
the State of Connecticut applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within that state.</b>

            (g) Costs. To the extent permitted by law, the Holding Company will pay or reimburse any reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, you incur as a result of any Employment Matter. However, you
agree to repay any expenses paid or reimbursed by the Holding Company if it is determined pursuant to Section
9[b] that you brought or contested the Employment Matter in bad faith.

                  (1) References to [A] <i>Sections</i> are to sections of this Agreement unless otherwise
            stated and [B] any <i>contract</i> (including this Agreement) are to the contract as amended, modified,
            supplemented or replaced from time to time,

                  (2) The various <i>headings</i> in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and
            in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of any provisions or Sections of this
            Agreement.

                  (3) Unless the context requires otherwise, (A) words describing the singular number include
            the plural and <i>vice versa</i>, (B) words denoting any gender include all genders and (C) the
            words "<i>include</i>", "<i>includes</i>" and "<i>including</i>" will be deemed to be followed by the words
            "without limitation."

                  (4)   It is your and the Group's intention that this Agreement not be construed more strictly
            with regard to you or the Group.

            (b) <i>Withholding</i>. You and the Group will treat all payments to you under this Agreement as
compensation for services. Accordingly, the Group may withhold from any payment any taxes that are required to
be withheld under any law, rule or regulation.

            (c) <i>Allocation</i>. The obligations of the Holding Company and the Insurance Company under this
Agreement are several (and not joint). The Holding Company and the Insurance Company will allocate their
respective obligations under this Agreement in accordance with their customary practices, and the allocation
will be final and binding on you.

            (d) <i>Entire Agreement</i>. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you, on the one hand, and the
Holding Company and Insurance Company, on the other hand, with respect to the relationship contemplated by this
Agreement and supersedes any earlier agreement, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, no party has relied on or made any representation, warranty,
inducement, promise or understanding that is not in this Agreement.

            (e) <i>Severability</i>. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent
jurisdiction (or legally empowered agency) to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then (1) the
provision will be amended automatically to the minimum extent necessary to cure the illegality or invalidity
and permit enforcement and (2) the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected. In particular, if any
provision of Section 7 is so found to violate law or be unenforceable because it applies for longer than a
maximum permitted period or to greater than a maximum permitted area, it will be automatically amended to apply
for the maximum permitted period and maximum permitted area.

            (f) <i>No Set-off or Mitigation</i>. Your and the Holding Company's and the Insurance Company's respective
obligations under this Agreement will not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other right
you or any member of the Group may have against each other or anyone else. You do not need to seek other
employment or take any other action to mitigate any amounts owed to you under this Agreement, and those amounts
will not be reduced if you do obtain other employment (except as this Agreement specifically states).
