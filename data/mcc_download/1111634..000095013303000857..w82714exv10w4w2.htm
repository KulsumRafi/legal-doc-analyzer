<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall have executed and delivered to the other party each
agreement attached as an Exhibit hereto and shall have complied with all the
provisions thereof to be performed upon such execution. There shall have been
no material breach of this Agreement or the occurrence of an event which, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, would constitute a breach, and all
of the representations made by the parties in Section&nbsp;5 shall be true and
correct as of the Closing Date in every material respect. Failure by XO and
Grantee to make each and every payment required by Section&nbsp;6 of this Agreement
on or before the date such payment is due shall (without the giving of notice)
constitute a material breach of this Agreement by XO and Grantee.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <B>Representations.</B>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party represents and warrants to the other as follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Each party has full power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each
party has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part
of each party, which authorization shall include any affiliates of the parties
responsible for performing under this Agreement.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; This Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party,
enforceable against each party in accordance with its terms.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp; The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each party and the
performance by such party and its affiliates of the terms, covenants and
conditions contained herein will not violate the articles of incorporation or
by-laws of each party or affiliates, or any order of a court or arbitrator, and
will not conflict with and will not constitute a material breach of, or default
under, the provisions of any material contract by which either party and its
affiliates are bound.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; XO and Grantee hereby represent and warrant to Level 3 that the only
creditors of Grantee as of the date hereof are, and as of the Closing Date
shall be, Level 3, XO (and certain of its subsidiaries) and the lenders party
to XO&#146;s secured credit facilities.

credits granted or otherwise available to XO or Grantee may be used to pay the
foregoing amounts; (b)&nbsp;shall be nonrefundable; and (c)&nbsp;shall not be affected by
or subject to any set off, counterclaim, defense or abatement whatsoever. In
the event that Closing occurs, the foregoing payments (if and only if full
payment is made on or before the dates set forth above) shall constitute
payment in full of the Recurring Charge, relocation expenses, unscheduled
maintenance and repair costs, Impositions, interest, penalties or other charges
due and payable by Grantee under the IRU Agreement (and by XO under and
pursuant to that certain Amendment of Guaranty Agreement executed on or about
May&nbsp;9, 2000) as of the date hereof and through January&nbsp;1, 2003. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 hereof prior to the
Closing, the payments made by XO and Grantee under this Section&nbsp;6 shall be
retained by Level 3 and applied against amounts otherwise due and owing under
the IRU Agreement. In addition, each party shall immediately give effect to
the credits and other payment concessions and terms contained in Exhibits B and
D attached hereto as if the Closing had occurred (except that the credits
granted to XO shall not be used to pay amounts due from XO and Grantee as set
forth above). In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section&nbsp;7 hereof prior to the Closing, then all payments that would have
otherwise been due and owing from one party to the other which were not made as
a result of application of credits granted pursuant to Exhibits B and D shall
be made within 10&nbsp;days following such termination (so that the parties&#146;
respective rights and obligations are governed in accordance with various
agreements executed prior to the execution of this Agreement). In the event
that such payment is not made, each party shall be entitled to offset from its
payment obligations hereunder any amounts due and owing from the other party.
In addition, prior to the Closing or termination of this Agreement, no party
shall take any action with respect to any default or other violation of any
agreement being amended in an Exhibit hereto if such default or other violation
would be cured, released or otherwise become discharged if the Closing occurs.

approval of the other party, it being understood that assumption of this
Agreement as part of the plan approved in XO&#146;s bankruptcy proceeding shall not
be deemed an assignment thereof. After the Closing Date, this Agreement, and
each of the Exhibits attached hereto, shall be binding and enforceable on all
parties in interest, including without limitation any chapter 7 trustee in the
event of a conversion of XO&#146;s Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy proceeding to a Chapter&nbsp;7
bankruptcy proceeding.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; No waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent right or remedy under
this Agreement. The consent by one party to any act by the other party
requiring such consent as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed to
render unnecessary the obtaining of consent to any subsequent act for which
consent is required as provided by this Agreement, regardless of whether
similar to the act for which consent is given.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; The laws of the State of New York (without regard to rules governing
conflicts of law) shall govern the enforcement of this Agreement. Each party
hereby irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury in any proceeding to
enforce this Agreement.

respect to the subject matter hereof.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any
number of counterparts, each of which counterpart, when so executed and
delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same agreement. Facsimile signatures shall be
sufficient to bind the parties hereto.

consequential or punitive damages (including but not limited to any alleged
loss of revenue or profits, cost of capital, business interruption, cost of
replacement services, claims of customers for service interruptions or
transmission problems or loss of opportunity) whether foreseeable or not, that
may result from or be related to any performance or breach of this Agreement.

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp; If the Approval Order is obtained, nothing herein shall prevent a
party from commencing a separate action or actions for any breach of this
Agreement, and the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over XO&#146;s Chapter&nbsp;11
proceedings shall retain jurisdiction to hear any such action or actions.

remedies which may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of
this Agreement by each non-performing party. In the event of any action to
enforce this Agreement, the non-performing party hereby waives the defense that
there is an adequate remedy at law. In the event a dispute arises as to the
parties&#146; rights and obligations under this Agreement, the party who
substantially prevails in such dispute shall be entitled to be paid immediately
by the non-prevailing party the reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs incurred

Grantee&#146;s obligation to pay the Recurring Charges otherwise due under the IRU
Agreement, and (b)&nbsp;eliminate the IRU (or any other rights, including ownership
rights) that Grantee has or may have in and to the Grantee Conduit and certain

Grantor&#146;s good faith estimate of the Incremental Costs which will be payable by
Grantee if Grantee exercises the Tag-Along Right with respect to such Segment

its Tag-Along Right with respect to a portion of a Segment, Grantee shall have
no further Tag-Along Right respecting other conduits within such portion of

desires to retain fiber and requires the same fiber type as Grantee intends to
use, then Grantee may supply the fiber and Grantor shall use such fiber for
installation into the Grantee Conduit. If Grantor intends to retain fiber but
requires a different fiber type as Grantee intends to use, then Grantor shall

will be incurred in connection with the installation, and Grantee shall pay
