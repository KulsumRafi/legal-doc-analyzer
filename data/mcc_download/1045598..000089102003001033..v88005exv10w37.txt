<PAGE>

         (d)      The number of shares of "Registrable Securities then
                  outstanding" shall be determined by the number of shares of

2.   Initial Registration.

         The Company shall, subject to the limitations of Section 5, use its
best efforts to effect within ninety (90) days of satisfying one or both of the
Laurus Conditions (defined below) the registration under the Act of all
Registrable Securities then outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if
the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement
pursuant to this Section 2, a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer
of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company, including a majority of the directors designated or nominated by
Flying Food Group, LLC, or its affiliates (collectively, "FFG"), if any, it
would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its shareholders for such
registration statement (or any amendment thereto) to be filed and it is
therefore essential to defer the filing of such registration statement (or any
amendment thereto), the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a
period of not more than sixty (60) additional days; and (ii) the Company will
not be required to cause the registration statement to be declared effective,

Ltd. ("LAURUS") consents to the effectiveness of the registration statement or
(y) the Promissory Note in the original principal amount of $1,250,000, dated
June 18, 2002, between Laurus and the Company, is repaid in full (collectively
the "LAURUS CONDITIONS".)

<PAGE>

         If (but without any obligation to do so) the Company proposes to
register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the Company for
shareholders other than the Holders) any of its Common Stock under the Act in
connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other
than a registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in
a Company stock-based incentive plan), the Company shall, at each such time,
promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration. The Company shall
include in such registration, subject to the provisions of Sections 5, 8 and 9,
all the Registrable Securities then outstanding and specified in a written
request or requests made by Holders within (15) days after the date of the
written notice by the Company of such registration. A Holder's written request
may specify that all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities be
registered in the registration.

4.   Obligations of the Company.

         Whenever required under this Agreement to effect the registration of
any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably
possible:

                  Form S-1, Form S-3 or such other form, as required by the
                  applicable provision of this Agreement, as is appropriate to
                  register the resale of Registrable Securities by the selling
                  Holders;

         (b)      use its best efforts, subject to receipt of necessary
                  information from the selling Holders, to cause such

                  a Section 2 registration, within 90 days after the issuance of
                  the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) in the
                  case of a Section 3 or 11 registration, as promptly after
                  filing as practicable;

         (c)      prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
                  to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in
                  connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such
                  Registration Statement effective until (i) in the case of a
                  Section 2 registration, the earlier to occur of (A) such time
                  as no Holder named in the Registration Statement holds or has
                  the right to receive any of the Registrable Securities
                  registered therein or (B) such time as such Holders may sell
                  their Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the
                  Act or pursuant to any similar rules that may be promulgated
                  without volume limitations, and (ii) in the case of a Section
                  3 or 11 registration, such time as no Holder named in the
                  Registration Statement holds or has the right to receive any
                  of the Registrable Securities registered therein;

         (d)      furnish to the selling Holders with respect to the Registrable
                  Securities registered on the Registration Statement (and to
                  each underwriter, if any, of such Registrable Securities) such
                  number of copies of the Registration Statement and supplements
                  to the prospectus contained therein and such other documents
                  as the selling Holders or underwriter may reasonably request
                  in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of
                  all or any of the Registrable Securities by the selling
                  Holders;

                  Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such
                  other securities or "Blue Sky" laws of such jurisdictions as
                  shall be reasonably requested by the Holders, provided that
                  the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or
                  as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a
                  general consent to service of process in any such states or
                  jurisdictions;

         (f)      promptly notify the selling Holders of the time when such
                  Registration Statement has become effective or a supplement to
                  any prospectus forming a part of such Registration Statement
                  has been filed;

         (g)      promptly notify the selling Holders of any request by the SEC
                  after the Registration Statement has become effective for the

                  prospectus or for additional information;

         (h)      prepare and file with the SEC, promptly upon the request of
                  any selling Holder, any amendments or supplements to such
                  Registration Statement or prospectus which, in the reasonable
                  opinion of counsel for such selling Holder are required under
                  the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in connection
                  with the distribution of Registrable Securities by such
                  selling Holder;

         (i)      prepare and promptly file with the SEC and promptly notify the
                  selling Holders of the filing of such amendment or supplement
                  to the Registration Statement or prospectus as may be
                  necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the
                  time when a prospectus relating to such securities is required
                  to be delivered under the Act, any event shall have occurred
                  as the result of which any such prospectus or any other
                  prospectus as then in effect would include an untrue statement
                  of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
                  to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
                  in which they were made, not misleading;

                  Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any
                  proceeding for that purpose and promptly use its best efforts
                  to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its
                  withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

         (k)      if such registration includes an underwritten public offering
                  or upon written request by any selling Holder or group of
                  selling Holders whose Registrable Securities shall be included
                  in such Registration Statement with an aggregate market value
                  at the date of such request exceeding $500,000, furnish on the
                  effective date of the Registration Statement and, if such
                  registration includes an underwritten public offering, at the
                  closing provided for in the underwriting agreement: (i)
                  opinions, dated such respective date, of the counsel

                  matters as such underwriters and selling Holder or Holders may
                  reasonably request, in which letters such accountants shall
                  state (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) that

                  date of such registration;

         (o)      provide the selling Holders and any underwriters of
                  Registrable Securities a reasonable opportunity to perform due
                  diligence concerning the Company, including a reasonable

5.   Limitations; Agreements of Holders.

         (a)      it shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the
                  Company to take any action pursuant to this Agreement with
                  respect to any selling Holder that such selling Holder shall
                  furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the
                  Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of
                  disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably
                  requested by the Company in effecting the registration of its
                  Registrable Securities and to execute such documents in
                  connection with such registration as the Company may
                  reasonably request.

         (b)      the Company may at any time that it is eligible to do so,
                  prepare and file an amendment or supplement to the
                  Registration Statement or prospectus with the

                                        5

<PAGE>

                  SEC and promptly notify the selling Holders of the filing of
                  such amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
                  prospectus as the Company may desire in order to effect the
                  conversion of the Registration Statement from Form S-1 to Form
                  S-3, or vice versa;

         (c)      each Holder agrees that, if so requested by the Company, it
                  will not effect any offer or sale of shares pursuant to the
                  Registration Statement, or otherwise, or engage in any hedging
                  or other transaction intended to reduce or transfer the risk
                  of ownership for any period deemed necessary (i) by the
                  Company in connection with a notice provided pursuant to
                  Section 4(g) or 4(j) or a proposed supplement or amendment
                  pursuant to Section 4(h) or 4(i), or (ii) by the Company at
                  any other time that the Company determines, in its sole
                  discretion, that the existence of material nonpublic
                  information regarding the Company or other circumstances make
                  such activities inappropriate. Any period within the period
                  provided for in Section 4(c) during which the Company fails to
                  keep the Registration Statement effective and usable for
                  resales of the Registrable Securities, or requires pursuant to
                  this subsection that the Holders not effect sales of shares
                  pursuant to the Registration Statement, is hereafter referred
                  to as a "Suspension Period." A Suspension Period shall
                  commence on the date set forth in a written notice by the
                  Company to the Holders that the Registration Statement is no
                  longer usable for resales of shares or, in the case of a
                  suspension pursuant to this subsection the date specified in
                  the notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this
                  subsection, and shall end on the date when each holder of
                  shares covered by the Registration Statement either receives
                  the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
                  contemplated by herein or is advised in writing by the Company
                  that use of the prospectus or sales may be resumed. If the
                  event that any Suspension Period occurs, the effective period
                  under Section 4(c) shall be extended by an amount of time
                  equal to the Suspension Period.

         (d)      each Holder agrees that, if so requested by the Company, it
                  shall keep the fact of any notification pursuant to Section
                  4(g), 4(j) or 5(c) and the contents of any such notification
                  confidential.

6.   Liquidated Damages

                           (a)      The Company acknowledges and agrees that
                  Purchaser shall suffer damages and that it would not be
                  feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with
                  precision if the Company fails to fulfill certain of its
                  obligations hereunder. Accordingly, in the event of such
                  failure, the Company agrees to pay to Purchaser, as liquidated
                  damages, and not as a penalty, under the circumstances and to
                  the extent set forth below:

                                             (i)      if, pursuant to Section 2
                           hereof, the registration statement covering all of
                           the Registrable Securities then outstanding has not
                           been filed with the SEC on or prior to 90 days after
                           the issuance of the Warrant and the Series D
                           Preferred Stock;

                                        6

<PAGE>

                                             (ii)     if such registration
                           statement is not declared effective by the SEC on or
                           prior to 150 days after the issuance of the Notes
                           pursuant to the Purchase Agreement;

                                             (iii)    if the registration of the
                           Registrable Securities is not consummated on or
                           before the 30th Business Day after the date on which
                           the such registration statement is declared effective
                           by the SEC; or

                                             (iv)     if such registration
                           statement is filed and declared effective by the SEC,
                           but thereafter ceases to be effective at any time
                           prior to the time that the Registrable Securities are
                           sold by the Holders thereof subject to the
                           Registration Statement.

(each of the foregoing an "EVENT," and the date on which the Event occurs being
referred to herein as an "EVENT DATE").

         (b)      Upon the occurrence of any Event, the Company shall pay, as
                  liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, to Purchaser for
                  each weekly period beginning on the Event Date an amount equal
                  to the Liquidated Damages; provided, that such Liquidated
                  Damages, in each case, shall cease to accrue (subject to the
                  occurrence of another Event) on the date on which all Events
                  have been cured. The Company shall not be required to pay
                  Liquidated Damages for more than one Event at any given time.
                  An Event under clause (i) above shall be cured on the date
                  that the registration statement is filed with the SEC; and an
                  Event under clause (ii) above shall be cured on the date that
                  the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC;
                  and an Event under clause (iii) above shall be cured on the
                  date on which the registration statement is no longer subject
                  to an order suspending the effectiveness thereof or
                  proceedings relating thereto. The Liquidated Damages will be
                  determined by multiplying the applicable Liquidated Damages
                  rate by the principal amount of the Notes, multiplied by a
                  fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such
                  Liquidated Damages rate was applicable during such period
                  (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
                  30-day months) and the denominator of which is 360.

         (c)      The Company shall notify Purchaser of the occurrence of an
                  Event within five Business Days after each Event Date. The
                  Company shall pay the liquidated damages due by transferring
                  to Purchaser, by 12:00 noon, Chicago time, immediately
                  available funds in sums sufficient to pay the Liquidated
                  Damages then due. The Liquidated Damages due shall be payable
                  in the same manner as interest payments on the Notes on each
                  interest payment date to Purchaser to be made on such date as
                  set forth in the Notes.

         (d)      For purposes of this Section 6, "Liquidated Damages" means,
                  with respect to any Event, an amount equal to the interest
                  that shall accrue on the Notes over and above the stated
                  interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days
                  immediately following the Event Date, increasing by an
                  additional 0.25% per

                                        7

<PAGE>

                  annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period;
                  provided, that the increase in the stated interest shall not
                  exceed 1.00% per annum in the aggregate.

7.   Expenses of Initial and Company Registration.

         All expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) and
the fees and disbursements of one special counsel to the selling Holders
incurred in connection with registrations in which any Holders participate
pursuant to Sections 2, 3 or 11 hereof, including, without limitation, all
registration, filing and qualification fees, printing and accounting fees, and
the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company shall be borne by the
Company.

8.   Underwriting Requirements.

         The Company shall not be required under Sections 3 or 11 to include any
of the Holders' securities in an underwritten offering of the Company's
securities unless such Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed
upon between the Company and the underwriters selected by the Company, assuming
usual and customary underwriting terms. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, in the case of an underwritten offering in which Registrable
Securities are to be included pursuant to Section 3, if the managing underwriter
shall advise the Company in writing that the total number of securities,
including Registrable Securities, requested by shareholders to be included in
such offering exceeds the amount of securities, other than securities to be sold
by the Company, that marketing factors allow, then the Company shall be required
to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including
Registrable Securities, which the managing underwriter believes marketing
factors allow the securities so included to be reduced as follows: (i) all
securities which are not Registrable Securities, securities held by Laurus, or
its affiliates, or securities covered by the Registration Rights Agreement dated
August 15, 1997 (the "REGISTRATION AGREEMENT") shall be excluded from the
offering to the extent limitation on the number of shares included in the
underwriting is required, and (ii) if further limitation on the number of shares
to be included in the underwriting is required, then the number of shares that
may be included in the underwriting held by Holders of Registrable Securities
shall be reduced pro rata based on the total number of securities held by such
persons; provided that, in no event shall the number of securities requested to
be registered by Holders of Registrable Securities be reduced below 20% of the
aggregate shares to be offered in the registration unless such Holders request
that securities constituting less than 20% of the aggregate shares to be offered
in the registration be registered on such Registration Statement, in which
event, all such securities shall be included.

9.   Indemnification.

         In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a Registration
Statement under this Agreement:

         (a)      To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and
                  hold harmless each Holder, the partners, officers, agents,
                  employees and directors of each Holder, any underwriter (as
                  defined in the Act) for such Holder and each person, if any,
                  who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of
                  the Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
                  (the "1934 ACT"), against any

                                        8

<PAGE>

                  losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to
                  which they may become subject under the Act, the 1934 Act or
                  other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims,
                  damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise
                  out of or are based upon any of the following statements,
                  omissions or violations (collectively, a "VIOLATION"): (i) any
                  untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
                  fact contained in such Registration Statement, including any
                  preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein
                  or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or
                  alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
                  be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein
                  not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by
                  the Company of the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities law
                  or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934
                  Act or any state securities law; and the Company will
                  reimburse each such Holder, partner, officer, agent, employee
                  or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal
                  or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection
                  with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
                  liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity
                  agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to
                  amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
                  liability or action if such settlement is effected without the
                  consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable in any
                  such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
                  action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a
                  Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
                  written information furnished expressly for use in connection
                  with such registration by, or on behalf of, any such Holder,
                  underwriter or controlling person.

         (b)      To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder severally
                  and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
                  each of its officers, directors, agents or employees, each
                  person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of
                  the Act, any underwriter and any other Holder selling
                  securities in such Registration Statement or any of its
                  partners, agents, employees, directors or officers or any
                  person who controls such Holder, against any losses, claims,
                  damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company
                  or any such director, partner, agent, employee, officer,
                  controlling person, or underwriter, or other such Holder or
                  director, officer, partner, agent, employee or controlling
                  person may become subject, under the Act, the 1934 Act or
                  other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims,
                  damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise
                  out of or are based upon any violation, in each case to the
                  extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in
                  reliance upon and in conformity with written information
                  furnished by, or on behalf of, such Holder expressly for use
                  in connection with such registration; and each such Holder
                  will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
                  by the Company or any such partner, agent, employee, director,
                  officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Holder, in
                  connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
                  claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that
                  the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(b) shall
                  not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any

                                        9

<PAGE>

                  such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
                  settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder,
                  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
                  provided, further, that each selling Holder shall be liable,
                  under this Section 9(b) for only that amount of losses,
                  claims, damages and liabilities as does not exceed the net
                  proceeds to such selling Holder as a result of such
                  registration.

         (c)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
                  Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action
                  (including any governmental action), such indemnified party
                  will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
                  indemnifying party under this Section 9, deliver to the
                  indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement
                  thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
                  participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so
                  desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
                  notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
                  satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
                  indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
                  counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the
                  indemnifying party, if, in the opinion of counsel for the
                  indemnifying party, representation of such indemnified party
                  by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be
                  inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
                  between such indemnified party and any other party represented
                  by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver
                  written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable
                  period of time of the commencement of any such action shall
                  relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
                  indemnified party under this Section 9 to the extent
                  materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action,
                  but the omission so to deliver written notice to the
                  indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that
                  it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this
                  Section 9.

         (d)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is held
                  by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
                  indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim,
                  damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying
                  party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
                  hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
                  such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability,
                  claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate
                  to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the
                  one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in
                  connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in
                  such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any
                  other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
                  the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be
                  determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
                  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
                  omission to state a material fact relates to information
                  supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party
                  and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
                  information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such
                  statement or omissions.

         (e)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
                  provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in
                  the underwriting agreement entered

                                       10

<PAGE>

                  into in connection with the underwritten public offering are
                  in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in
                  the underwriting agreement shall control.

10.  Reports Under the Act.

         With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of SEC Rule
144 promulgated under the Act and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that
may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public
without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company
agrees to:

         (a)      make and keep public information available, as those terms are
                  understood and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times;

         (b)      take such action as is necessary to enable the Holders to
                  utilize Form S-3 for the sale of their Registrable Securities;

         (c)      file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
                  documents required of the Company under the Act and the 1934
                  Act; and

         (d)      furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any
                  Registrable Securities, forthwith upon written request (i) a
                  written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the
                  reporting requirements of SEC Rule 144, the Act and the 1934
                  Act, or as to its qualification as a registrant whose
                  securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time
                  after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual
                  or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and
                  documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other
                  information as may be reasonably requested in availing any
                  Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC which permits the
                  selling of any such securities without registration or
                  pursuant to such form.

11.  Form S-3 Registration.

         In case the Company shall receive from the Holders of at least
twenty-five percent (25%) in interest of the Registrable Securities, a written
request or requests that the Company effect a registration on Form S-3 and any
related qualification or compliance with respect to Registrable Securities, the
Company will:

         (a)      promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and
                  any related qualification or compliance, to all other Holders;
                  and

         (b)      as soon as practicable, effect such registration and all such
                  reasonable qualifications and compliances as may be so
                  requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and
                  distribution of all or such portion of such Holder's or
                  Holders' Registrable Securities as are specified in such
                  request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable
                  Securities of any other Holder or Holders joining in such
                  request as are specified in a written request given within
                  twenty (20) days after receipt of written notice from the
                  Company; provided, however,

                  that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
                  registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this
                  Section 11: (i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering
                  by the Holders; (ii) if the Holders, together with the Holders
                  of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion
                  in such registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities
                  and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to
                  the public of less than $500,000; (iii) if the Company shall
                  furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the President
                  of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the
                  Board of Directors of the Company, including a majority of the
                  directors designated by FFG, if any, such registration would
                  be materially detrimental to the Company, and the Board of
                  Directors of the Company, including a majority of the
                  Directors designated by the FFG, if any, concludes as a result
                  that it is essential to defer the filling of such registration
                  statement at such time, then the Company shall have the right
                  to defer such filing of the registration statement for a
                  period of not more than sixty (60) days after receipt of the
                  request of the Holder or Holders under this Section 11;
                  provided, however, that the Company shall not utilize this
                  right more than once in any 12-month period; or (iv) in any
                  particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required
                  to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to
                  service of process in effecting such registration,
                  qualification or compliance.

the termination of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and such obligations shall instead terminate as set forth in Section
