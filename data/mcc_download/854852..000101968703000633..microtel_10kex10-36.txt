A        Venture has entered or shall enter into an Agreement for the Purchase

C        There exists certain intra-group indebtedness which is due owing or
         incurred by the Guarantor to the Parent and which is evidenced on
         certain intra group accounting arrangements.

D        The parties hereto have entered into this Deed to regulate the basic
         upon which all or any part of the Intra Group Indebtedness (as
         hereinafter defined) may be discharged.

IT IS AGREED THAT:

1        INTERPRETATION

1.1      In this Deed, except where the context otherwise requires, each of the

<PAGE>

         (a)      the Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with
                  the terms; and

         (b)      Venture has unconditionally released the Guarantor from all
                  and any of its obligations to Venture pursuant to the
                  Guarantee; and

         (c)      all and any monies and/or liabilities which are now or shall
                  become due, owing or incurred by the Guarantor and/or the
                  Company to Venture on any account whatsoever (including
                  without limitation under the Agreement and/or the Guarantee)
                  have been satisfied in full unconditionally and cannot be
                  subsequently avoided or reduced (whether or not by or in
                  pursuance of any provision of law or legal process).

3        UNDERTAKING OF THE PARENT

3.1      Subject to Clause 4 below, the Parent irrevocably warrants and
         undertakes in favour of Venture that it shall not without the prior
         written consent of Venture accept repayment of all or any part of the

         satisfied.

4        PERMITTED REPAYMENTS

         from time to time is in excess of two hundred thousand pounds sterling
         ((pound)200,000) (the "Threshold"), nothing in Clauses 2.1 and/or 3.1
         shall prevent the Guarantor making, nor the Parent accepting repayment
         of all and any sums in excess of the Threshold.
