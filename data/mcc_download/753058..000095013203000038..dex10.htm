completed and signed forms pass through the central cashier&#146;s department of the Polish Post Office every month. There the data are checked and transferred by hand into the financial systems that the Post Office uses to settle the various social
security payments. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The demand for fast, error-free processing
has long outpaced the capacity and possibilities of the departments that are responsible for the processing work. Something has to change. The entire system needs to be overhauled. Or the inspection work needs to be automated. </FONT></P><P

With their optical character recognition systems they have already created a sensation by taking only a few minutes to read in without error hundreds of census forms that had been filled in by hand &#150; a job that would have taken days for a human
to complete. Their RecoStar systems effortlessly select the right data from different forms, Interpret them and store them away. Their high-end equipment even features two character recognition devices that operate in competition with each other and
then agree on the best interpretation. At the moment the RecoStar in Bydgoszcz processes 400,000 forms per day, scans them, seeks out key data, processes them in the system and archives them. More than 85% of these forms are read without error. The
remainder still require a human eye. The Polish Post Office is convinced. As are banks, universities, insurance companies and tax authorities all over the world. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

will also allow future generations to fulfil their ambitions and needs. This conviction fits within a long-term perspective. The company&#146;s 125-year history &#150; but certainly also its current business practice &#150; demonstrates that
Oc&eacute; takes its responsibilities in this area extremely seriously. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"

again under pressure in all major markets in which Oc&eacute; is active. At the start of the year under review a modest recovery in the economy was still expected for the second half of the year. That expectation did not materialise. In its report
of December 2002 the <SMALL>OECD</SMALL> predicted that in 2003 there would be a very limited growth in the Gross Domestic Product of Oc&eacute;&#146;s most important markets, varying from 1.5% (Germany) to 2.6% (United States). A recovery is not
foreseen by the <SMALL>OECD</SMALL> before the end of 2003. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">In
view of this not very favourable outlook, the willingness to invest by the customers is not expected to increase over the short term, which also means that sales of machines will not recover in full. Oc&eacute;&#146;s order portfolio at the
beginning of 2003 still does not show any clear improvement either. In 2002 sales of machines accounted for approximately 30% of Oc&eacute;&#146;s revenues. As time passes, however, the decline in machine sales also starts to impact on the service
revenues that are generated by the machines that have been installed in the market. However, the (postponed) need for replacement investments continues to exist and the quality and possibilities of the new Oc&eacute; machines and systems that were
recently launched will certainly provide support for sales. Oc&eacute; therefore anticipates that it will at least be able to maintain its position in the market. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

(paper) documents and the requirements they have to meet are changing. Whereas previously it was a matter of copying and then distributing, documents are now distributed first in digital form (mostly via e-mail), then retrieved, looked at and
printed out if and when required. Printing-on-demand and personalised documents are taking the place of big print-runs and generic documents. In order to be able to work efficiently, customers are increasingly asking for a complete integration of
paper and digital document flows. As a result demand is shifting away from stand-alone machines towards complex systems for the management of documents. This process is being accelerated by the continued growth in the production of information. At
the same time the use of colour is becoming an increasingly indispensable element in document flows. Despite the steadily growing document flow, the demand for machines, both colour and black-and-white, appears to be cyclical. </FONT></P><P

Network printers and multi-functional machines are replacing stand-alone copiers. Printing technology is developing more and more into a commodity: its costs are coming down, print quality is getting better and affordable colour technology &#150; of
a high quality &#150; is available. So that they can continue to stand out from other offerings, systems are being tailored more and more to meet the specific customer demands in a segment. Modular and scaleable systems provide the solution to this.

However, the rate of turnover of assets will increase as a result of the significant reduction in assets, thanks in particular to the outsourcing of the lease portfolio. <SMALL>ROA</SMALL> is the product of operating income as a percentage of sales
and the turnover of the total assets (operating income/sales x sales/total assets). As described in previous annual reports, achieving a 12% <SMALL>ROA</SMALL> means seeking an operating result as a percentage of sales of 10 or more and a turnover
of total assets of at least 1.2. In a situation in which the lease activities have been completely outsourced and in which the other planned strategic and operational actions have been implemented, the above ratios will alter and amount to around 6%

financial activities is formed by the interest from financial leases. The costs comprise the costs of financing the lease portfolio and the administrative and selling expenses. Where the financial activities are financed from interest-bearing
capital, it has been assumed that this has been done fully on a fixed-interest basis. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

applied which corresponds to that of external captive lease companies with similar activities. After expiry of the lease contracts the machines, provided they have not been written off in full, are transferred to the commercial activities at their
residual book value. For the financing of the financial activities a ratio of 0.15 between the equity and the balance sheet total is used. This ratio is likewise derived from captive companies in the financial services industry which publish their
own annual accounts. The remaining part of the equity is allocated to the commercial activities. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

accounted for separately. In the case of an operational lease contract machines are rented to customers for durations of, normally, one to three years. The rental instalments from these contracts are included in the revenue for the reporting period
in which they fall due. The rental instalments cover the cost of use, servicing and interest. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

The production of information and documentation continues to grow. Documents are increasingly distributed in digital form, and are only printed out later. High volumes are still printed centrally or are contracted out to commercial print shops.

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><B>Facility Services</B> A clear tendency exists within big corporations to concentrate on their core activities and to contract out their non-mainstream activities to specialists. Repro departments,
for example, are contracted out to partners who can also manage complex document processes in an efficient and effective way. This guarantees the flexibility needed to handle constantly changing user requirements, such as printing in colour and
document management. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Oc&eacute; has already built up a strong

Expectations for this market are high, despite the poor economic climate. Businesses feel the need to structure and use their know-how and documents in an efficient way. In addition, trends such as decentralised printing and printing-on-demand help
to give digital documents an increasingly important role compared to paper documents. In a number of countries it is in fact already compulsory for certain government documents to be archived in digital form. </FONT></P><P

documents and the related requirements that are set for document flows are changing. Though more documents are being produced, these are printed out less often and are increasingly being printed in decentralised locations. The total print volume is
growing slightly. Scanning and digital archiving are becoming ever more important. The share of colour is growing, and with it the importance of inkjet printers. At the end of 2002, therefore, Oc&eacute; launched the Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TCS</SMALL>
400 wide format colour printer. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The position held by Oc&eacute;

SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">In the markets in which Oc&eacute; is active with its Technical Document Systems two distinct trends are emerging: colour and decentralisation. Although printing in design engineering offices is still done predominantly in
black-and-white, the use of colour is advancing strongly. To ensure they are prepared for this, more and more customers are asking for colour machines, which means that inkjet printers are rapidly gaining ground in the low volume segment. At the end
of November 2002 Oc&eacute; responded to this by introducing a colour machine, the Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TCS</SMALL> 400, specifically focused on meeting these needs. The Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TCS</SMALL> 400 is a wide format colour printer that is destined
in particular for use in construction companies and architectural and engineering offices. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Due to a change in the way that documents are distributed, decentralisation of the print volume is increasing. In former days documents were generally printed first and then distributed, but
today&#146;s practice first involves their (digital) distribution, after which the image is viewed and/or printed as and when required. Within an organisation this therefore creates a higher demand for smaller machines. Especially the Oc&eacute;
<SMALL>TDS</SMALL> 400 and the Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TDS</SMALL> 600 fit well within this application profile. The Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TDS</SMALL> 400 and the Oc&eacute; <SMALL>TDS</SMALL> 600 are wide format production systems for the printing, copying,
scanning and finishing of technical documents. Thanks to internet printing and scanning is possible at any location. The flow of documents in this segment of the market is changing in character because parallel design processes are today often
chosen (due to the gain in speed). That involves much consultation between designers and an intensive use of the digital infrastructure. This is achieved by means of data lines with a higher transmission capacity, the use of cheaper storage media,
increasing the speed of internet access and by means of specific applications that facilitate such interactive teamwork. Oc&eacute; can see good opportunities for playing an important role in these processes via its document management software in
combination with printers. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Oc&eacute; has converted its

of state-of-the-art <I>piezo</I> inkjet printers under the name Arizona. Another of its major products is the prominent and very widely used Raster Imaging Process software of Onyx Graphics. The integration of the acquired operations progressed
favourably during 2002, despite the fact that this integration process and the realignment of the business group called for a great deal of management time and attention. In the market for Display Graphics Systems, which is fragmented in terms of
both suppliers and customers, Oc&eacute; has made a clear-cut choice to concentrate on the mid-volume and higher volume segments. Within the total <SMALL>DGS</SMALL> market the company is now one of the four biggest 44 players. Through the
acquisition of <SMALL>GPID</SMALL>, Oc&eacute; has strengthened its position substantially, for example in the fast-growing job printer market. This market is demanding for ever bigger print capacity. The fastest machine of <SMALL>ODGS</SMALL>, the
Oc&eacute; Arizona 500, is able to process around 50 square metres per hour. But Oc&eacute; is also one of the main suppliers serving other large-scale users of wide format colour printers, such as sign shops, silk-screen printers, photo processing
laboSratories and constructors of exhibition stands. As part of its endeavours to offer complete solutions Oc&eacute; will also continue its presence in the low volume sector by offering machines for outdoor applications. In this segment, however,
it will only sell third-party machines. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The basic position for
Oc&eacute; in the market for Display Graphics Systems is favourable, thanks to the strength of the brand, the company&#146;s world-wide presence and its own distribution channels and service activities. Based on these strengths the company will work
further to improve profitability, amongst other things via organisational changes, and to secure growth through an expansion of the range. Oc&eacute; is working on the further development of mid-volume machines for outdoor applications, featuring
such variants as <I>flatbed and roll-to-roll</I> machines. In the case of roll-to-roll the printed material is rolled up again after printing and is then processed in subsequent stages, for instance so that it can be used in a billboard application.
In the case of a flatbed it is possible to print direct on the ultimate carrier material. A new flatbed machine, the Oc&eacute; <SMALL>T</SMALL>220, will be launched in the first quarter of 2003. </FONT></P><P

certain overlap exists with the activities of Technical Document Systems. This overlap is used to create synergy effects between the two business groups in providing their shared customers with support in the development of wide format full colour
applications. Thanks to its broad range for the very high production segment of the market and a series of in-house technologies, supplemented in due course by the company&#146;s own inkjet technology, Oc&eacute; will be able to build a strong
position in Display Graphics Systems and a clear profile as compared to its main competing suppliers. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

COLOR="#000000">The analysis of Oc&eacute;&#146;s balance sheet is somewhat complicated due to the fact that both commercial activities and financing activities take place within the company. The latter activities relate chiefly to the provision of
finance to customers (financial leases). The breakdown showing the economic consequences of these activities is given on page 28 of this report. It is important to emphasise that the cash flow before financing activities (the free cash flow) from
the commercial activities has been positive over the past five years. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"
COLOR="#000000">Oc&eacute;&#146;s balance sheet is relatively &#145;long&#146; if measured by the rate of turnover of the assets. In 2002 this rate amounted to 1.07. This was despite the ongoing and successful emphasis on reducing inventories and
debtors. The main cause is the size of the financial lease portfolio which comprises about one-third of the total assets. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The strong balance-sheet position and also the sale of the lease portfolio that has already been started will make it possible for Oc&eacute; to invest in
high-yield activities, which will bring the return on assets to the desired level. Oc&eacute; will always adopt a conservative approach in this respect and will not invest in activities or invest such amounts which may endanger the company&#146;s
continuity if the expected synergy does not materialise. As regards this conservative approach the past should also serve as an example for the future. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

COLOR="#000000">The proceeds from the sale of the total lease portfolio could be used to repay all loans and deferred tax liabilities. Although every option will be considered, the optimisation of the capital structure pleads against using financial
resources in this way. The possibilities of acquiring businesses or activities are constantly looked at and it is certain that acquisitions will take place in the years ahead, provided that they ultimately bring an increase in shareholders&#146;
value and bring the return on total assets (<SMALL>ROA</SMALL>) to 12% or higher. Oc&eacute; seeks to keep equity at a level of about one-third of total assets, and preferably at a level of around 40%.The percentage will depend very much, however,
on the activities that are invested in and on the level of non-interest-bearing liabilities. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

pace with, what are in most cases, bigger competitors. That process has taken place continuously, from the disposal of its own sheet metalworking plant many years ago up to and including the outsourcing of the lease activities during the year under

other knowledge centres. In product development, cooperation with technology and system specialists has become the normal procedure. Oc&eacute; works together with all the big names in the area of printer technology and software and increasingly
places development assignments in the hands of these specialists, yet without relinquishing overall control. One of the components whose development is, in principle, not contracted out to third parties is the user interface. That part of the
Oc&eacute; product is regarded as a strategic component. In this way it is possible for Oc&eacute;, also by using parallel development procedures, to bring new products incorporating the most advanced technology to market in good time. </FONT></P><P

parts and components in the machines: a mere 5% of the production work is performed in Oc&eacute;&#146;s factories. Machine parts, components and in a number of cases complete sub-assemblies for machines are sourced from suppliers, who are not only
carefully selected but are in most cases also intensively involved in the development of the relevant components. In principle Oc&eacute; limits itself to supplying the specifications, after which the partner is responsible for an optimum price/
quality ratio and for ensuring the shortest possible time to production on an industrial scale. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

countries outside Western Europe, where the size of the sales market is still limited, Oc&eacute; works together closely with local dealers, in a number of cases on the basis of exclusivity. In this way Oc&eacute; usually achieves excellent results

employers for university graduates in general in the Netherlands; for technical specialists in particular a top-five position will be sought. In other countries, especially in Germany, Oc&eacute; likewise aims to create a clearly positive profile in
the labour market. Oc&eacute; will focus, even more than in the past, on recruiting the best employees and on structurally offering development opportunities in directions which are crucial for the future of the company and which bring out each

2002. The specialists of Oc&eacute; Facility Services, who are literally at home in hundreds of offices all over the globe, identify a remarkable fact. On the modern equipment that they operate for their customers a lot of printing is done and even
more copying: but as yet little use is made of the scanning function. Despite the fact that modern Oc&eacute; equipment makes it possible to digitize a complete report in just a few minutes, after which it is stored electronically or can be
distributed at lighting speed via the network. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><B>[PHOTO]

environmental damage and the development and dissemination of environmentally friendly technologies. In both areas Oc&eacute; is well advanced. In its major manufacturing sites Oc&eacute; has since 1997 had an environmental care system, which has an
<SMALL>ISO</SMALL> 14001 certification and which also comprises a consistent assessment of risks. This leads to preventive actions to keep the risks within acceptable limits and monitor them constantly. The entire process of product development,
manufacturing, possible re-use and the processing of waste and residual materials is subjected to a lifecycle analysis. New products are developed and produced as much as possible according to the <I>design for re-use </I>principle. That means that
as from the initial design stage a choice is made for safe materials, for maximum possibilities for the re-use of materials and components, for safe processes and for the safe processing of residual and waste materials by recognised recyclers. A not
inconsiderable environmental benefit is achieved because Oc&eacute; incorporates a number of basic technologies, such as the CopyPress technology, in particularly durable machine components that can be used again in new machines. </FONT></P><P

of environmental performance indicators which are analysed each year and published in the Netherlands in an annual report. The environmentally friendly methods that Oc&eacute; applies are also exchanged with and explained to other companies. The use
of environmental performance indicators is a good way of establishing and quantifying the difference between the existing and the desired situation. That also means that an environmentally aware company like Oc&eacute; is always alert to the
improvements that must be continuously sought. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

but takes priority over the choice processes. For many years a materials policy has been in force to guarantee the safety of materials and processes for people and the environment. The working conditions of employees are intensively screened. Apart
from technical measures much attention is also paid to managing the organisational risks, the aim being to improve the state of mind and well-being of employees. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

to a range of local activities in which no reference is made to the brand at all. In the Netherlands this has been the case virtually ever since the company&#146;s foundation. Oc&eacute;&#146;s support for the arts is reflected in the Netherlands,
for example, by its annual purchases of works by young artists. In 2002 Oc&eacute; helped to make possible an exhibition in the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, devoted, very appropriately, to the &#145;art of copying&#146; of Pieter Brueghel the
Younger. The world of sport can also count on the company&#146;s support. In 2003 Oc&eacute; is one of the main sponsors of the Special Olympics in Ireland, a sports event for athletes with mental limitations from all over the world. </FONT></P><P

for by the growth in revenues from software and services. As service activities are handled by the operating companies, these companies proved over the past period to be less affected by the slowdown in growth than the production locations. The year
2002 was characterised by good results in the operating companies and by under-utilisation in the production locations; ultimately this yielded an overall result that, given the prevailing market conditions, can be described as good. </FONT></P><P

currency. The biggest possible proportion of the costs is also incurred in that local currency. As the production and development of new products mainly takes place in the Eurozone, with some of the purchasing costs being denominated in other
currencies, a foreign exchange risk arises in respect of the flows of goods from the Eurozone to countries outside the Eurozone. At Oc&eacute; these net currency flows are the subject of an active foreign exchange management policy. This is
implemented in close consultation with the Board of Executive Directors. To control the effects of short-term exchange rate fluctuations on the margin, these positions are hedged up to a maximum of 80% (principally the <SMALL>US</SMALL> dollar,
pound sterling and Japanese yen). For several years now it has been company policy always to manage the 12-months position of the <SMALL>US</SMALL> dollar and the pound sterling on a roll-over basis, with hedging being applied up to a maximum of
80%. At balance sheet date the contract value of the forward foreign exchange contracts was &#128; 210 million. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
