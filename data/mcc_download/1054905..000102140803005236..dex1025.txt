       EMPLOYEE:               DR ALEXANDER A. DOBBIE

2.     Your Job Title is:      VICE-PRESIDENT, OCTEL CORP. and
                               MANAGING DIRECTOR - PETROLEUM SPECIALTIES
                               BUSINESS UNIT

       Reporting to :          PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

3.     Your Normal Place of Work will be:

       You will initially be employed at our Ellesmere Port site, but as a term
       of your employment you may also be required to work at or from any other
       of the Company's establishments. You may also be transferred or seconded
       between establishments when necessary as required by business needs.
       Whilst your Contract of Employment provides for such transfer or
       secondment the Company will give careful and sympathetic consideration to
       your personal circumstances and career interests.

4.     REMUNERATION

       i)     Your basic salary will be (Pounds)175,000 per annum paid monthly
              in advance by credit transfer. This will be reviewed on 1st
              January 2004, Ist March 2005 and every March thereafter.

       ii)    You will be entitled to participate in the Senior Management Bonus
              Plan In your case, the target pay-out would be 40 % of basic
              salary, subject to Company and personal performance. The Plan
              normally runs from 1/st/ January to 31/st/ December.

5.     HOURS OF WORK

       The normal hours of work are 38 hours per week exclusive of lunch breaks.

       The Company reserves the right to vary starting and finishing times
       either on a temporary or continuous basis. Any permanent departure from
       the normal working week will be notified in writing. However, irregular
       variations in working hours undertaken in response to operational needs
       will not be formally notified.

       For senior managers, it is recognised that the nature of their roles will
       involve occasionally working extended hours, either during the working
       week or at weekends. This is accepted as a normal part of the working
       life of a global business and does not warrant either extra payment or
       time off in lieu. Where a specific business reason requires working on a
       public holiday, time off in lieu on a day to day basis may be granted by
       a member of the Octel Management Board.

       The company recognises that you have commitments to other businesses as a
       result of your recent activities and it agrees that you can continue with
       these activities for up to 2 days per month provided, of course, that
       such activities are compatible with, and do result in a conflict of
       interest with, your responsibilities as an officer of the company.

                                                                               2

<PAGE>

6.     COMPANY CAR

       You will be provided with a fully expensed Company car (Lexus LS430 or
       equivalent) including private fuel. You may take a cash equivalent in
       lieu of a car. Currently the allowance is (Pounds)13,650 per annum. Will
       you please advise Wendy Thomas in Human Resources of your preferred
       option.

7.     HOLIDAYS

       For a full year your holiday entitlement is 25 days per annum. The
       holiday year runs from 1st March to the last day in February the
       following year.

       Service Related Holidays

       You shall be entitled to additional holiday entitlement dependent upon
       completed years of continuous service with the Company on the last day of
       February prior to the holiday year concerned with the following scale:

       Completed Years' Service                          Additional Holidays

                  5                                             1 day
                 10                                             1 day
                 15                                             1 day

       You must arrange the timing of your holidays with your manager so that
       adequate manning cover can be maintained. The minimum holiday that may be
       taken at any time shall normally be one full day. However, you may be
       permitted to take up to 10 half day holidays in any year, or to depart
       from the normal pattern of holidays described above, provided your
       manager is satisfied that such arrangement is in no way detrimental to
       operational needs or to the reasonable opportunity for other staff to
       take a holiday.

       The Company may, if necessary, nominate up to 1 day out of each year's
       entitlement when holiday must be taken. This may be on a general or
       departmental basis and advance notice will be given wherever possible.
       Any holiday entitlement outstanding at the end of the holiday year will
       normally be forfeited. However, in exceptional circumstances approval to
       carry over part (5 days maximum) of the entitlement from one holiday year
       to the next may be granted by the appropriate Octel Management Board
       Member, on the recommendation of the Department Manager and HR
       Department. During the months of January and February each year, staff
       may bring forward up to 5 days entitlement from the ensuing holiday year,
       by agreement with their manager.

8.     NOTICE

       The Company has the right to terminate your employment by giving you
       twelve months notice in writing. This will not apply in the event of
       gross misconduct. You are required to give the Company six months notice
       in writing of termination of employment. Written notice of termination
       addressed to your manager, may be given on any day and will begin from
       the start of the following day. Failure to give proper notice constitutes
       a breach of contractual obligations.

       The Company will normally require dismissed employees to terminate
       forthwith and may give pay in lieu of notice. Staff may, however, be
       summarily dismissed (i.e. without pay in lieu of notice) when the Company
       is satisfied that an individual is guilty of gross misconduct.

       Should the need arise for redundancies to be declared, the Company
       reserves the right to implement a system for selection based upon
       principles other than 'last-in, first-out'.

       In the event of a takeover or merger of the company, you will have an
       option to terminate your contract by giving one month's notice of
       termination, provided this termination is notified by

                                                                               3

<PAGE>

       you within 6 months of the takeover or merger date. If you take up this
       option, you will be entitled to compensation for loss of office from the
       company equivalent to your contractual entitlement (12 months salary,
       benefits and on target bonus, plus immediate vesting of any outstanding
       options) as if the company had terminated your contract.

9.     HEALTHCARE BENEFITS

       You will be entitled to the following healthcare benefits:

       Group Accident Insurance

       You will be covered by the Company's Group Accident Insurance. The
       Company's Insurance Department will be writing to you giving details of
       the Scheme.

       Octel Healthcare Scheme

       You are entitled to membership for your spouse, yourself and your
       children up to the age of 18 (or 21 if in full time education) at Company
       cost. This is a taxable benefit.

10.    SICKNESS ABSENCE

       The Company's scheme entitles you to payment of salary in respect of any
       period of up to one month's absence from work because of certified
       sickness or incapacity.

11.    MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS

       Employees may be required to submit to medical examinations, including
       biological sampling, which are either statutorily required, or are
       considered by the Company's Medical Officer to be necessary in connection
       with their duties.

       Any other investigations will be conducted on a purely voluntary basis.

       Should an employee, at any time, have been in contact with a person
       suffering from an infectious disease, they should consult the Company's
       Medical Officer before returning to work.

12.    PENSION

       Your pension options are detailed in a letter from Alan Hanslip dated
       17/th/ September 2002 (restated in appendix 1).

13.    INVENTIONS

       If at any time whilst employed by the Company a member of staff should
       invent, discover or devise individually or jointly with another person(s)
       any invention, design or improvement (collectively called 'the
       invention'), then the Company's and Employee's rights to such
       invention(s) are governed by current patent legislation.

       The legislation provides for employee inventions whether patentable or
       not, made in the course of an individual's normal duties to belong to the
       Company. In such cases the employee must promptly disclose the invention
       to the Company. Inventions not connected with an employee's work or
       duties belong exclusively to the employee. A further provision generally
       entitles employees to compensation when an invention they have made and
       which belongs to the Company is patented and that patent is of
       outstanding benefit to the Company.

                                                                               4

<PAGE>

       The Company's Patents Committee, in reviewing the particulars of
       employees' inventions, will take due account of the statutory provisions
       relating to inventions, Patents and Trade Marks. If you need further
       guidance on this section please consult your manager.

14.    SECRECY

       You must not make use of or disclose (either during the period of your
       employment by the Company or at any later date) any information
       concerning the business of the Company, which for the purpose of this
       paragraph means and includes any company or partnership subsidiary to or
       associated with it, or any of its customers except as may be necessary in
       the proper execution of your duties on behalf of the Company or with the
       prior written consent of the Company or to the extent that such
       information may be generally available to the public.

15.    PERSONAL DATA

       Octel needs to keep information about you for purposes connected with
       your employment. The sort of information we will hold includes
       information for payroll purposes, references, contact names and addresses
       and other personal details relating to your career with us. Some of this
       information may also be processed by other organisations on our behalf.

       We believe these uses are consistent with the principles of the Data
       Protection Act 1998. The information we hold will be for our management
       and administrative use only but we may, from time to time, need to
       disclose some information we hold about you to relevant third parties (eg
       The Inland Revenue). We may also transfer information about you to
       another Octel company/location (which may be outside of the European
       Economic Area) solely for purposes connected with your career or the
       management of our business. You agree to us keeping the information for
       these purposes throughout your employment and following its termination.

       You also agree to us keeping information about your health for the
       purposes of compliance with our health and safety and occupational health
       obligations; considering how your health affects your ability to do your
       job and, if you are or become disabled, whether you require any
       reasonable adjustments to be made to assist you at work; or in relation
       to the administration of insurance, pension, sick pay and any other
       related benefits in force from time to time.

       You agree to us holding details of any unspent convictions that may
       affect your suitability for employment in addition to any other personal
       data we require to ensure compliance with our Equal Opportunities Policy
       (eg race and/or ethnic origin).

       You will be awarded 3000 zero cost options upon your appointment. These
       shares will vest in 3 years and remain available for 10 years from your
       joining date with Octel.

       The details of the normal executive option scheme are detailed in the
       letter from Alan Hanslip dated 17/th/ September 2002 (restated in
       appendix 2)

17.    ACCOMMODATION ALLOWANCE

                                                                               6

                         Appendix 1 - Pension provision

Pension provision is a complex subject, particularly when cover above the
Pensions Cap is involved. Octel operates two basic (inland revenue approved)
pension schemes; a defined benefit (DB) scheme and a Group Personal Pension
(GPP) which is a defined contribution (DC) plan.

The DB plan was closed some years ago but we do retain the ability to admit new
members in exceptional circumstances and we would be prepared to enable you to
join. The plan provides 1/57/th/ per year of service and has generous early
retirement factors after age 50. We will accept transfers in. On top, we have
two DC plans for executives which provide a top up with a target (but obviously
no guarantee of 1/40/th/ when added to the DB plan). The plan up to the Cap
(currently (Pounds)97,200 pa) is approved (ie tax efficient) and a FURB is
provided above the Cap.

As an alternative, you could join the GPP in which you would pay 5% up to the
Cap and the company would provide 12.5% on top. Above the Cap the company will
fund the same as for the FURB ie 20 % of total salary above the Cap.

Thirdly, if you have your own personal pension plan the company will contribute
20% of your total salary or provide you with a similar salary supplement in lieu
of any pension provision. In all cases the amount which can be put into any
approved plan will, in your case, be approximately 30% of the Cap.

We have an independent financial advisor who knows our schemes well and provides
advice to senior Octel people at company cost. I strongly advise you to contact
him to discuss the pension options as they relate to your personal
circumstances. His name is Ian Glen, of Yorkshire Investment Group, telephone:
0113 222 9000. We will cover his fees. As you can see from the above we will
also be as flexible as we can in providing pension cover within the overall cost
parameters.

                                                                               7

<PAGE>

                         Appendix 2 -Stock Option Plans

We operate an annual stock plan which is awarded at Board discretion each spring
(after the annual results). Although discretionary, the Board has never
seriously considered not offering an annual award since the Spin in May 1998.

Our stock plan is a US type with a mixture of zero cost performance options and
fair market value time restricted options. The methodology is the classic US
Black-Scholes process and typically it would mean for you an annual grant of
zero cost performance options worth 15 % of salary and fair market value options
worth 38 % of salary. There is no absolute target, as such.

The vesting process is quite simple. In both cases the options vest after 3
years and are available up to 10 years from grant. The Compensation Committee of
the Board control the process, set the performance targets and agree the
outcomes.

                                                                               8
