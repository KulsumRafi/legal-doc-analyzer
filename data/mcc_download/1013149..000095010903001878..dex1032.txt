This Amendment is entered into as of March 17, 2003 by and between ICT Group,

Whereas, Company and Employee have entered into that certain employment
agreement dated July 7, 1997, as amended on May 14, 2001 (hereinafter the
"Employment Agreement"); and

Whereas, in consideration of the continued employment of Employee, and deeming
it to be in Company's best interest, Company and Employee now wish to amend a
certain provision of the Employment Agreement.

Now, therefore in consideration of the covenants and promise contained herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Company and Employee hereby agree as
follows:

     1.   Section 6 (a), Post-Termination Payments: Section 6 (a) of the
          Employment Agreement, as amended previously, is hereby amended by
          deleting Section 6 (a) in its entirety and replacing it with a new
          Section 6 (a) to read as follows: "(a) If Employee is terminated by
          Company pursuant to Paragraph 10 hereof, Company shall pay to Employee
          a monthly severance payment in an amount equal to Employee's monthly
          salary at the time of termination for either (i) twelve (12) months if
          Employee has less than ten (10) years of uninterrupted service with
          Company as of the effective date of employment termination or (ii)
          eighteen (18) months if Employee has ten (10) years or more of
          uninterrupted service with Company as of the effective date of
          employment termination, provided that Employee executes at the time of
          Employee's termination of employment a General Release satisfactory to
          Company of any and all claims which Employee may have arising out of
          or relating to Employee's employment with and/or termination of
          employment with Company. In addition, if Employee is terminated for
          any reason other than for Cause under Paragraph 9 or for an Inability
          under Paragraph 7 which is other than a disability, and on the
          effective date of such termination Employee is covered under Company's
          group health plan, Company shall maintain Employee in its group health
          plan on the same basis as if Employee had remained employed by Company
          during the Severance Period, for the duration of the Severance Period
          or until Employee becomes employed under another group health
          insurance plan, whichever occurs first."
     2.   Section 13, Restrictive Covenants, Trade Secrets, Etc. Section 13 of
          the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by inserting, immediately
          after the phrase "For a period of one (1) year" in the first sentence
          thereof, the following language: "(or for a period of 18 months if the
          Employee is entitled to 18 months of severance payments pursuant to
          Section 6 (a) of this Agreement)."
