<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Tom:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">As you are aware, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s and Moody&#146;s Investors Service recently
downgraded the credit ratings of the PG&#038;E National Energy Group (the &#147;Company&#148;)
and two of its subsidiaries to below investment grade. While disappointing,
these downgrades are in keeping with the rating agencies&#146; larger overall review
of the energy sector. In response to the downgrades and the challenging market
conditions affecting our sector of the energy industry, the Company has
embarked upon a major cost reduction effort with the goal of achieving a
reduction of at least $40&nbsp;million in annual operating expenses.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In order to encourage you to continue your contribution to the success of the
Company amidst these challenging and disruptive business conditions, you are
being provided with a retention award subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this letter (the &#147;Letter&#148;) and the PG&#038;E National Energy Group
Management Retention Program (the &#147;Program&#148;).
