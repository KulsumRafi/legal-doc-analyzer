as patent licensee and which is more onerous than an obligation of corresponding category on the part of Licensee under this agreement, then any exercise of the option by Licensee shall operate so

applicable, any value added tax thereon) due to MRC. If MRC shall give notice to Licensee within 30&nbsp;days of the receipt of any such statement that it does not accept the same such statement
