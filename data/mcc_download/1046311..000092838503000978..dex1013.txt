PAGE 1 - EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

<PAGE>

          five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of the
          Company's then outstanding securities; or

               Company with or involving any other corporation, other than a

               voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior
               thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding

          part of a purchasing group which consummates the Change in Control
          transaction. The Participant shall be deemed "part of a purchasing
          group" for purposes of the preceding sentence if the Participant is an

               company or group which is otherwise not significant, as
               determined prior to the Change in Control by a majority of the
               nonemployee continuing Directors.

          For purposes of this Section, the terms "Person" and "Beneficial
Owner" shall have the meanings given those terms in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 13d-3 under that Act.

Account an amount equal to (a) less (b), where:

               (a)  Equals total base salary (up to fifteen percent (15%)
          total) deferred under this Plan and the Company's 401(k) plan, times
          the Participant's Match Rate; and

               (b)  Equals the match to the Company's 401(k) plan which is
          allocated to such Participant's account in the 401(k) plan, after all
          necessary adjustments have been made to reflect any applicable
          nondiscrimination rules.

          The amount credited to the Matching Contribution Account shall be as
of the date designated by the Administrative Committee.

          The Employer may make contributions in such amount and at such times
as recommended by the Administrative Committee and approved by the Compensation
Committee of the Board, or as the Board, in its sole discretion, shall
determine. Such amount shall be credited to the Participant's Discretionary
Contribution Account as of the date designated by the Administrative Committee.

4.6       Transfer Contribution

          Any Eligible Participant who has one or more account balance in the
Company's Deferred Compensation Plan or in the Company's Nonqualified Retirement
Savings and Investment shall have their balances in such plans transferred to
this Plan as of the date or dates selected by the Committee. Such transfers to
this Plan shall include the vested and nonvested portions of the Participant's
balances in such Plans, and such amounts shall be appropriately allocated among
the Participant's Termination Account and Matching Contribution Account,
respectively.

4.7       Vesting of Accounts

          Each Participant shall be vested in the amounts credited to such
Participant's Account as follows:

          Contribution Account shall be vested at the rate of twenty percent
          (20%) for each completed Year of Service; except, a Participant shall
          become one hundred percent (100%) vested at death or Disability. In
          addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board, or the Board, may,
          in its sole discretion, accelerate all or any portion of a
          Participant's Matching Contribution Account at any time and from time
          to time.

               (c)  Discretionary Contributions. A Participant's Discretionary

<PAGE>

4.8       Statement of Accounts

          From time to time, but not less frequently than annually, the
Administrative Committee shall provide to each Participant a benefit statement
setting forth the balance of the Accounts maintained for the Participant.

                       ARTICLE V--INVESTMENT AND EARNINGS

5.1       Plan Investments

          A Participant shall complete a portfolio allocation form electing from
among a series of hypothetical investment options designated by the
Administrative Committee into which the Participant's Elected Deferred
Compensation, Transfer Contribution and all Employer contributions shall be
credited. In addition to the hypothetical investment options designated by the
committee, the Moody's Plus Rate of Return shall also be available as a
hypothetical investment for all active Participants and any Participant who
terminates after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more Years of Service. For
Participants who terminate before age fifty-five (55) and ten (10) Years of
Service, the Moody's Rate of Return shall be available. In the event a
Participant terminates employment prior to age fifty-five (55) or prior to
having completed ten (10) or more Years of Service and does not terminate with
the approval of the Board, then from and after such termination, the Moody's
Rate of Return shall not be an available hypothetical investment option as to
such Participant.

          The performance of the Participant's Accounts shall be measured based
upon the investment options selected. The Participant's Accounts shall be
credited with such hypothetical crediting rates calculated after any applicable
investment managers' expenses have been deducted but before any
insurance-related or other expenses have been deducted. Investment options may
be changed monthly by following such procedures as may be determined by the
Administrative Committee. A revised or changed investment allocation shall be
effective on the first business day of the next month following the
Participant's request for a change.

5.2       Crediting Investment Gains and Losses

          Participant Accounts shall be credited daily with investment gains and
losses as if such Account(s) were invested in one (1) or more of the Plan's
investment options, as selected by the Participant, less administrative charges
applied against the particular investment options.

                            ARTICLE VI--PLAN BENEFITS

6.1       Commencement and Distribution Options

               (a)  Commencement. Benefits shall commence based upon an election
          made by the Participant. Participants may elect to commence benefits
          upon termination or a January selected by the Participant. Such date
          may not be later than January following the Participant's sixty-fifth
          (65th) birthday.

               (b)  Form of Payment. Benefits payable due to the Participant's
          election or the death of the Participant may be made in one (1) or a
          combination of the following forms:

PAGE 8 - EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

<PAGE>

                    (i)   Lump Sum. One (1) lump-sum payment.

                    (ii)  Installment Payments. Annual installment payments
               amortized over a period of up to twenty (20) years, as elected by
               the Participant. The first installment payment shall be paid as
               soon as is administratively feasible after the Participant's
               elected date or death. Subsequent installments shall be paid at
               the beginning of each subsequent Plan Year based on the remaining
               Account balance as of the immediately preceding December 31, as
               adjusted for gains and losses, and the remaining number of
               installment payments. Adjustments for investment gains and losses
               shall continue on unpaid Account balances.

                    (iii) If a Participant has made no election, benefit
               payments shall be paid in a lump sum upon termination.

               (c)  Change in Form and Time of Payment. A Participant's
          election as to the form and time of distribution shall be irrevocable,
          except that a Participant may file a new form and time of payment
          election which shall supersede his most recent prior election provided
          the election is made at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of
          scheduled benefit commencement or death. An election filed within the
          sixty (60) days preceding scheduled benefit commencement or death
          shall be null and void and the next preceding timely election filed by
          the Participant shall be controlling.

6.2       Death Benefits

               (a)  Pre-Benefit Commencement. A Beneficiary shall receive
          all of the Participant's Account balances in the form elected by the
          Participant pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Plan.

               (b)  Post-Benefit Commencement. If a Participant dies following
          the commencement of benefit payments, the Employer shall continue to
          pay to the Beneficiary any remaining installment payments that would
          have been paid to the Participant had the Participant survived.

                    If a Participant dies after all Account balances have been
          completely distributed, no death benefit shall be payable to the
          Beneficiary under the Plan.

               (c)  Investment Direction. The Beneficiary shall succeed to the
          Participant's right to direct investments pursuant to Section 5.1 of
          the Plan following the Participant's death.

               (d)  Subsequent Beneficiaries. If a Beneficiary who is receiving
          payments dies before all payments have been paid, any subsequent
          Beneficiary (as determined and provided for in Article VII) shall be
          paid any remaining Account balances in a lump sum as soon as practical
          after the death of the first Beneficiary.

6.3       Disability Benefits

          Upon a finding that a Participant has suffered a Disability, the
Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the Participant's
current Deferral Election or make distributions notably from the Participant's
Accounts in an amount reasonably necessary to meet the Participant's needs
resulting from the Disability. Such distribution shall not exceed the
Participant's vested balance in the Participant's Accounts and shall be paid in
a single lump sum.

PAGE 9 - EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

<PAGE>

6.4       Hardship Distribution

          Upon finding that a Participant or Beneficiary has suffered a
Financial Hardship, the Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion,
make distributions from the Participant's Account prior to the time specified
for payment of benefits under the Plan. The Hardship Distribution shall be made
ratably from all Accounts. The amount of such distribution shall be limited to
the amount reasonably necessary to meet the Participant's or Beneficiary's
requirements during the Financial Hardship.

          Applications for a Hardship Distribution and determinations thereon by
the Administrative Committee shall be in writing, and a Participant or
Beneficiary may be required to furnish written proof of the Financial Hardship,
as determined by the Administrative Committee in its sole discretion.

          Upon receiving a Hardship Distribution, a Participant's Deferral
Election shall cease and such Participant shall not participate in the Plan
until the first day of the Plan Year following twelve (12) months from the date
of the Hardship Distribution.

6.5       Accelerated Distribution

          Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, at any time a
Participant shall be entitled to receive, upon written request to the
Administrative Committee, a lump-sum distribution equal to ninety percent (90%)
(ninety-four percent (94%) if requested within thirty-six (36) months of a
Change in Control) of the vested balance of his Accounts on the last day of the
month immediately preceding the date on which the Administrative Committee
receives the written request. The remaining balance of such Accounts plus any
nonvested amounts shall be forfeited by the Participant. Notwithstanding any
provision in the Plan to the contrary, a distribution pursuant to this Section
6.5 shall be made as soon as administratively feasible but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after the request is received by the Administrative
Committee. Such Participant's Deferral Election shall cease at the time the
request is filed with the Administrative Committee and such Participant shall
not be eligible to make a new Deferral Election until the first day of the Plan
Year following a period of twelve (12) months from the date of distribution.

6.6       Small Benefit

          Notwithstanding any election made by the Participant, if, on the
Participant's date of termination or date of death, the vested balance of his
Accounts is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), such Account shall be
paid to the Participant or Beneficiary in a single lump sum.

6.7       Withholding and Payroll Taxes

          The Employer shall withhold from Plan payments and, in the case of
Social Security and Medicare taxes, shall withhold from Elected Deferred
Compensation, any taxes required to be withheld under federal, state or local
law. Such taxes shall be withheld from the Plan payments to the maximum extent
possible with any excess being withheld from the Participant's nondeferred base
salary or bonus to the maximum extent possible , and then from the Participant's
Elected Deferred Compensation. Each Participant shall bear the ultimate
responsibility for payment of all taxes owed under this Plan.

PAGE 10 - EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

<PAGE>

6.8       Payment to Guardian

          If a Plan benefit is payable to a minor or a person declared
incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of his
property, the Administrative Committee may direct payment to the guardian,
conservator, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such
minor, incompetent or incapacitated person. The Administrative Committee may
require proof of minority, incompetency, incapacity, conservatorship or
guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution. Such distribution
shall completely discharge the Administrative Committee from all liability with
respect to such benefit.

                      ARTICLE VII--BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

7.1       Beneficiary Designation

          Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate one
(1) or more persons or entity as Beneficiary (both primary as well as secondary)
to whom benefits under this Plan shall be paid in the event of Participant's
death prior to complete distribution of the Participant's vested Account
balance. Each Beneficiary designation shall be in a written form prescribed by
the Administrative Committee and shall be effective only when filed with the
Administrative Committee during the Participant's lifetime.

          For married Participants living in a community property state, the
Participant's spouse shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) interest in any
benefit due the Participant unless such spouse waives the right to receive such
benefit by executing a written consent acknowledging the effect of the
Beneficiary designation, or it is established that such consent cannot be
obtained because the spouse cannot be located.

          If the Participant's validly designated Beneficiary survives the
Participant but dies prior to the complete distribution of the Participant's
benefits, the remaining benefits will be paid to the deceased Beneficiary's
estate in accordance with Section 6.2(d).

7.2       Changing Beneficiary

          Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a Participant living
outside a community property state without the consent of the previously named
Beneficiary by the filing of a new Beneficiary designation with the
Administrative Committee.

          A married Participant living in a community property state may change
Beneficiary designation by filing a new Beneficiary designation with the
Administrative Committee with the consent of the Participant's spouse as
provided for in Section 7.1 above. The filing of a new designation shall
supercede all designations previously filed.

7.3       No Beneficiary Designation

          If any Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary in the manner
provided above, if the designation is void, or if the Beneficiary dies before
the Participant, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the person in the first
of the following classes in which there is a survivor:

               (a)  The Participant's surviving spouse;

PAGE 11 - EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

<PAGE>

               (b)  The Participant's children in equal shares, except that if
          any of the children predecease the Participant with surviving issue,
          then such issue shall take by right of representation;

               (c)  The Participant's estate.

7.4       Effect of Payment

          Payment to the Beneficiary shall completely discharge the Employer's
obligations under this Plan.

account of such person's service on the Administrative Committee, except in the
case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.5       Election of Committee After Change in Control

          After a Change in Control, vacancies on the Administrative Committee

                            ARTICLE XI--MISCELLANEOUS

11.1      Unfunded Plan

          This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily to provide deferred
compensation benefits for a select group of "management or highly-compensated
employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and therefore is
exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA.

11.2      Unsecured General Creditor

          Participants and Beneficiaries shall be unsecured general creditors,
with no secured or preferential right to any assets of the Company or any other
party for payment of benefits under this Plan. Any property held by any Employer
for the purpose of generating the cash flow for benefit payments shall remain
its general, unpledged and unrestricted assets. The obligation of the Employer
under the Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the
future.

11.3      Trust Fund

          At its discretion, the Company may establish one (1) or more trusts,
with such trustees as the Board may approve, for the purpose of providing for
the payment of benefits owed under the Plan. Although such a trust may be
irrevocable, its assets must be held for payment to Employer's general creditors
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. To the extent any benefits provided
under the Plan with respect to an Employer's Participants are paid from any such
trust, that Employer shall have no further obligation to pay such benefits. If
not paid from the trust, such benefits shall remain the obligation solely of
such Employer.

11.4      Nonassignability

          Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to
commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise
encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the
amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof. Such payments, and all
rights thereto are expressly declared to be unassignable and nontransferable. No
