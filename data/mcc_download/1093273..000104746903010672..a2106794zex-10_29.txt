          dollars.

          2.1.3.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
          Lender shall be obligated to make its Rateable Portion of any Advance
          (and the Borrower shall not request any Advance to be made) to the
          extent that on any relevant Borrowing Date, after giving effect to any
          Advance requested: (i) the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's
          Rateable Portion of all Loans under the Credit Facility would exceed
          its Lender's Commitment at such time; or (ii) the aggregate principal
          amount of all Loans under the Credit Facility would exceed the
          Aggregate Commitment at such time.

          2.1.4.    The Credit Facility is to be used for general corporate
          purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including for purposes
          of financing Permitted Acquisitions, Capital Expenditures and working
          capital needs.

          2.1.5.    At no time shall the aggregate amount of all Loans
          outstanding under the Credit Facility exceed the Aggregate Commitment.

2.2.      REVOLVING NATURE OF OPERATING FACILITY

                 The Borrower may, until the Termination Date, increase or
decrease the Obligations under the Credit Facility by making drawdowns,
repayments and further drawdowns up to the Aggregate Commitment from time to
time. The Aggregate Commitment and each of the Lender's Commitments shall be
reduced to nil on the Termination Date, and the Borrower shall repay to the
Agent for the account of the Lenders on the Termination Date all amounts then
outstanding under the Credit Facility. In the event that the Aggregate
Commitment is reduced pursuant to Schedule 1.1.61 on May 1, 2003, the Borrower
shall repay to the Agent for the account of Bank of Montreal on May 1, 2003, the

                 The Borrower may from time to time (without premium or penalty)
on any Banking Day repay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, Loans or
portions thereof under the Credit Facility, provided that any such repayment (i)
if Bank of Montreal is the only Lender hereunder (a) shall be in an amount of at
least $100,000 and any greater amount shall be an integral multiple of $10,000
and (b) shall be effected on the same Banking Day on which notice in writing is
provided to the Agent if received

prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago time) or on the next succeeding Banking Day if not
received by such time, in either case, such notice, once given, shall be
irrevocable and binding upon the Borrower, or (ii) if Bank of Montreal is not
the only Lender hereunder, (x) shall be in an amount of at least $1,000,000 and
any greater amount shall be an integral multiple of $100,000, and (y) shall only
be effected on at least three Banking Days' notice in writing to the Agent which
notice, once given, shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Borrower, and
(iii) any repayment of a Libor Loan other than on the Maturity Date applicable
thereto, pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) of this section 2.3, shall be
subject to the payment of the expenses payable pursuant to section 3.8. Any
repayments made under this section 2.3 shall not reduce any Lender's Commitment
or the Aggregate Commitment.

2.4.      MANDATORY REPAYMENT FROM PUBLIC OFFERINGS

          2.4.1.    Subject to section 2.4.2, all net cash proceeds (after
          giving effect to underwriters' commissions, discounts and payment of
          offering-related expenses, including (without limitation)
          underwriters' fees and expenses, Securities Commission filing fees,
          stock exchange listing fees and fees and disbursements of counsel to
          the Borrower and, if paid by the Borrower, underwriters), up to the
          lesser of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) the amount of all Obligations then
          outstanding, of each public offering of debt or equity completed by
          the Borrower (excluding the proceeds of the Borrower's first public
          markets transaction in 2002) shall be paid to the Agent for the
          account of the Lenders for application against such of the
          Obligation's outstanding under the Credit Facility as shall reasonably
          be determined by the Borrower; provided, however, such proceeds shall
          not be applied to any L/C Loans or, at the Borrower's option, Libor
          Loans, until the Maturity Date applicable thereto and, until such
          application, the proceeds allocated for such purpose shall be held by
          the Agent for the account of the Lenders and invested on behalf of the
          Borrower in an interest-bearing investment (or investments) as
          security for the repayment of future indebtedness of the Borrower
          under such L/C Loan or Libor Loan, with interest earned thereon, if
          any, to be paid to the Borrower on repayment of such Loans. The amount
          of such application so made shall be permanent and irrevocable and
          each Lender's Commitment shall be reduced rateably.

          2.4.2.    On any Banking Day which is at least 45 days prior to the
          closing of any such offering, the Borrower may in writing request the
          consent of the Lenders for it to retain all or part of such proceeds
          in lieu of remitting such proceeds to the Agent for the account of the
          Lenders otherwise required pursuant to section 2.4.1. The decision of
          each Lender in this regard shall be made in its sole discretion. The
          Agent shall forthwith provide a copy of such request to each Lender.
          Each Lender shall notify the Agent as to whether it consents to such
          request within 15 days of receipt thereof. If any Lender does not
          provide such notice within such time, such Lender shall be deemed to
          have not consented to such request. On the earlier of (i) the Banking
          Day next following the date on which the Agent is in receipt of
          notices from all Lenders; and (ii) the second Banking Day following
          the last day for receipt by the Agent of such notices, the Agent shall
          give written notice to the Borrower and each of the Lenders, with
          respect to each Lender, whether such Lender has consented to the
          request. If all the Lenders consent to any such request, the proceeds
          from the offering in respect of which such request was made shall be
          retained by the Borrower and not remitted to the Agent for the account
          of the Lenders. If any Lender (for purposes of this section 2.4.2,
          each a "Non-Consenting Lender") does not so consent (or is deemed to
          not so consent), the Borrower may elect to have one or more substitute
          Lenders (arranged by the Borrower at its expense) assume the Lender's
          Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to section 12.9.4
          (other than clause (a) thereof). Such assignment shall be made without
          recourse to, warranty by (except as to title) or expense to the
          assigning Lender except with respect to past acts of such Lender. If
          the full amount of the Lender's

<Page>

                                     - 23 -

          Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender is not so assumed, the
          Borrower shall pay to the Agent such Non-Consenting Lender's remaining
          Rateable Portion of the Borrower's net cash proceeds referred to in
          section 2.4.1 for the account of the Non-Consenting Lender, for
          application against the unassumed portion of the Non-Consenting
          Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loans outstanding under the Credit
          Facility; provided, however, such payment shall not be applied to any
          L/C Loans or, at the Borrower's option, Libor Loans, until the
          Maturity Date applicable thereto and, until such application, the
          proceeds allocated for such purpose shall be held by the Agent for the
          account of the Lenders and invested on behalf of the Borrower in an
          interest-bearing investment (or investments) as security for the
          repayment of future indebtedness of the Borrower under such L/C Loan
          or Libor Loan, with interest earned thereon, if any, to be paid to the
          Borrower on repayment of such Loans. The amount of such application so
          made shall be permanent and irrevocable and upon all such Loans
          outstanding having been prepaid in accordance with the foregoing, the
          Lender's Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender which has not been
          assigned pursuant to section 12.9.4 shall be cancelled and reduced by
          the amount of the principal prepayment hereunder (or commitment
          reduction).

2.5.      VOLUNTARY REDUCTION IN AGGREGATE COMMITMENT

                 The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time, by giving at least two Banking Days' notice to the Agent which notice,
once given, shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Borrower, to reduce the
then applicable Aggregate Commitment to a lower amount which is not less than
the principal amount of all Obligations then outstanding under the Credit
Facility. Such notice shall specify the amount of the reduction, which shall be
in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. The amount of any such reduction so made
by the Borrower shall be permanent and irrevocable and each Lender's Commitment
shall be reduced rateably.

2.6.      EXTENSION OF CREDIT FACILITY

                 On any Banking Day which is at least 60 days prior to the
Termination Date, the Borrower may request that the Termination Date be extended
to the date which is 364 days after the date on which its extension request
delivered hereunder is accepted by the Lenders pursuant to this section 2.6. The
decision of each Lender in this regard shall be made in its sole discretion. The
Agent shall forthwith provide a copy of such extension request to each Lender.
Each Lender shall notify the Agent as to whether it consents to the extension
request within 30 days of receipt of a copy from the Agent. If any Lender does
not provide such notice within such time, such Lender shall be deemed to have
refused such extension. On the earlier of (i) the Banking Day next following the
date on which the Agent is in receipt of notices from all Lenders; and (ii) the
second Banking Day following the last day for receipt by the Agent of such
notices, the Agent shall give written notice to the Borrower and to each of the
Lenders advising, with respect to each Lender, whether such Lender has consented
to the extension. If all of the Lenders consent to any such request, the
Termination Date shall be extended to the date which is 364 days thereafter. If
any Lender (for purposes of this section 2.6, each a "Non-Consenting Lender")
elects not to so extend the Termination Date (or is deemed to not so elect), the
Borrower may elect to have one or more substitute Lenders (arranged by the
Borrower at its expense) assume the Lender's Commitment of such Non-Consenting
Lender pursuant to section 12.9.4 (other than clause (a) thereof). Such
assignment shall be made without recourse to, warranty by (except as to title)
or expense to the assigning Lender except with respect to past acts of such
Lender. If the full amount of the Lender's Commitment of the Non-Consenting
Lender is not so assumed, the Borrower may elect to prepay the Non-Consenting
Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility on,
in respect of any (a) Base Rate Loan, any day; (b) Libor Loans, the applicable
Interest Period end dates or such other date provided the Borrower pays all
amounts payable in connection with such prepayment pursuant to section 3.8;

<Page>

                                     - 24 -

and (c) L/C Loans, the applicable Maturity Dates. Upon all such Loans
outstanding having been prepaid in accordance with the foregoing, the Lender's
Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall be cancelled and reduced to zero.
If (x) the Termination Date has been extended pursuant hereto, and (y) there
remains any Non-Consenting Lender whose Lender's Commitment has not been assumed
or whose Rateable Portion of the Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility
have not been prepaid, the Lender's Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender
shall be cancelled and reduced to zero on the old Termination Date and such
Non-Consenting Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loans outstanding under the
Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, shall be repaid in full, in
each case, on the old Termination Date.

2.7.      INCREASE IN AGGREGATE COMMITMENT

                 On a Banking Day which is at least 60 days prior to the
Termination Date, the Borrower may request that the Aggregate Commitment be
increased in an amount of at least $10,000,000 and any greater amount shall be
an integral multiple of $1,000,000. The decision of each Lender in this regard
shall be made at its sole discretion. The Agent shall forthwith provide a copy
of such increase request to each Lender. Each Lender shall notify the Agent as
to whether it consents to the increase request within 15 days of receipt of a
copy from the Agent, the amount of such increase such consenting Lender agrees
to underwrite (up to its Rateable Portion) and, if such Lender is willing to
underwrite an amount in excess of its Rateable Portion of the requested
increase, the amount of such excess. If any Lender does not provide such notice
within such time, such Lender shall be deemed to have refused such increase. On
the earlier of (i) the Banking Day next following the date on which the Agent is
in receipt of notices from all Lenders; and (ii) the second Banking Day
following the last day for receipt by the Agent of such notices, the Agent shall
give written notice to the Borrower and to each of the Lenders advising, with
respect to each Lender, whether such Lender has consented to the increase and
the amount of such increase such consenting Lender has agreed to underwrite. The
Agent shall have the sole discretion to allocate to Lenders willing to
underwrite more than their Rateable Portion of the requested increase any
amounts that other Lenders are not willing to underwrite. If Lenders consent to
increase the Aggregate Commitment by the amount requested, subject as
hereinafter provided, the Aggregate Commitment shall be increased by the amount
set forth in the request in proportion to each Lender's Rateable Portion if all
Lenders agree to the full amount of the requested increase, or otherwise in such
proportion as may be determined by the Agent in its sole discretion. Prior to
any increase in the Aggregate Commitment becoming effective, the parties hereto
shall enter into an agreement amending the terms of this Agreement (and any
agreement delivered pursuant hereto) to give effect to such increase and to
incorporate such changes as the Lenders and Borrower may agree. If the Borrower
and all Lenders are unable to agree to such changes (each disagreeable Lender
for purposes of this section 2.7, a "Non-Consenting Lender"), or if any Lender
(for purposes of this section 2.7, each also a "Non-Consenting Lender") does not
consent (or is deemed to not so consent) to the full amount of the increase
request as aforesaid, the Borrower may elect to have one or more substitute
Lenders (arranged by the Borrower at its expense) assume the Lender's Commitment
of such Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to section 12.9.4 (other than clause (a)
thereof). Such assignment shall be made without recourse to, warranty by (except
as to title) or expense to the assigning Lender except with respect to past acts
of such Lender. If the full amount of the Lender's Commitment of the
Non-Consenting Lender is not so assumed, the Borrower, at its option, shall
either (a) withdraw its request for such increase and pay all the Agent's and
Lenders' reasonable costs and expenses incurred to consider such request, or (b)
pay to the Agent for the account of the Non-Consenting Lender, in an amount
equal to, and for application against, the unassumed portion of the
Non-Consenting Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loans outstanding under the
Credit Facility; provided, however, such payment shall not be applied to any L/C
Loans or, at the Borrower's option, Libor Loans, until the Maturity Date
applicable thereto and, until such application, the proceeds allocated for such
purpose shall be held by the Agent for the account of the Lenders and invested
on

                                     - 25 -

behalf of the Borrower in an interest-bearing investment (or investments) as
security for the repayment of future indebtedness of the Borrower under such L/C
Loan or Libor Loan, with interest earned thereon, if any, to be paid to the
Borrower on repayment of such Loans. The amount of such prepayment so made shall
be permanent and irrevocable and upon all such Loans outstanding having been
prepaid in accordance with the foregoing, the Lender's Commitment of such
Non-Consenting Lender shall be cancelled and reduced to zero. The Borrower shall
not be entitled to make more than one request for an increase in the Aggregate
Commitment in any Fiscal Quarter and any request made but withdrawn after the
Agent provides the Lender with a copy of the request pursuant to clause (a) of
this section 2.7 shall constitute a request for such purposes.

                                   ARTICLE 3.
               GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY

3.1.      ADVANCES

          3.1.1.    Each request by the Borrower for an Advance under the Credit
          Facility shall be made by the delivery of a duly completed and
          executed Borrowing Notice to the Agent at its Branch of Account:

                 3.1.1.1.  in the case of Advances by way of Base Rate Loans on
                 any proposed Borrowing Date, (i) if Bank of Montreal is the
                 only Lender hereunder and the amount of such Advance is less
                 than $1,000,000, not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on
                 such proposed Borrowing Date (provided, if the Borrowing Notice
                 is not received by Bank of Montreal by such time, the Advance
                 will be made on the next succeeding Banking Day), or (ii) if
                 the amount of such Advance is $1,000,000 or more, or if Bank of
                 Montreal is not the only Lender hereunder, not later than 10:00
                 a.m. (Chicago time) on the first Banking Day prior to the
                 proposed Borrowing Date; and

                 3.1.1.2.  in the case of Advances by way of L/C Loans or Libor
                 Loans, not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the third
                 Banking Day prior to the proposed Borrowing Date.

          3.1.2.    Any notice in respect of a proposed Advance shall be
          irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

          3.1.3.    If Bank of Montreal is the only Lender hereunder, all
          Advances (other than Advances by way of Letters of Credit) shall be in
          an amount of at least $100,000 and any greater amount shall be an
          integral multiple of $10,000, otherwise such Advances shall be in an
          amount of at least $1,000,000 and any greater amount shall be an
          integral multiple of $100,000.

3.2.      SELECTION OF INTEREST PERIODS

                 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof:

          3.2.1.    the Borrower may not select any Interest Period in respect
          of a Loan under the Credit Facility with a Maturity Date which is
          later than the Termination Date; and

          3.2.2.    the number of Interest Periods in effect at any time shall
          not exceed ten in the aggregate.

<Page>

                                     - 26 -

3.3.      ROLLOVER AND CONVERSION

          3.3.1.    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
          provided that no declaration has been made by the Agent under section
          9.2, the Borrower may from time to time request that a Loan or any
          portion thereof be rolled over or converted to another form of Loan in
          accordance with the provisions hereof.

          3.3.2.    The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the account of the
          Lenders the full Libor Loan on the Maturity Date of the Interest
          Period applicable thereto, in accordance with the provisions hereof
          governing repayment and prepayment, unless such Loan shall be rolled
          over or converted to another form of Loan on such Maturity Date in
          accordance with the provisions hereof.

          3.3.3.    Each request by the Borrower for a Rollover or Conversion
          shall be made by the delivery of a duly completed and executed
          Borrowing Notice to the Agent at the Branch of Account, and the
          provisions of section 3.1 shall apply to the Rollover or Conversion as
          if such Rollover or Conversion were an Advance, except that the
          Borrower shall not be required to make (and shall not otherwise be
          deemed to have made, renewed or repeated) any representation or
          warranty in connection with any Rollover or Conversion.

          3.3.4.    Each Rollover or Conversion of a Libor Loan shall be made
          effective as of the Maturity Date of the Interest Period applicable
          thereto.

          3.3.5.    If the Borrower does not deliver a Borrowing Notice at or
          before the time required by section 3.1.1 and, in the case of a Libor
          Loan, fails to pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders the
          principal amount thereof on the Maturity Date of the relevant Interest
          Period, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Conversion of
          such Loan to a Base Rate Loan, and all of the provisions hereof
          applicable to Base Rate Loans shall apply thereto.

          3.3.6.    A Rollover or Conversion shall not constitute a repayment of
          the relevant Loan but shall result in a change in the basis of
          calculation of interest or fees (as the case may be) for such Loan, in
          accordance with the provisions hereof.

3.4.      PAYMENTS GENERALLY

                 All payments in respect of the Credit Facility (in respect of
principal, interest, fees or otherwise) shall be made by the Borrower to the
Agent no later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the due date thereof to the
account specified therefor by the Agent at its Branch of Account or to such
other accounts in the United States of America as may be specified by the Agent
to the Borrower from time to time. Any payments received after such time shall
be considered for all purposes as having been made on the next following Banking
Day unless the Agent otherwise agrees in writing. All payments shall be made by
way of immediately available funds.

3.5.      DISTURBANCE OF LIBOR MARKET

                 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if at any time
prior to the commencement of an Interest Period in respect of any proposed Libor
Loan, any Lender determines in good faith (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding), and provides a certificate to the Agent with respect to
such determination, that with respect to such Libor Loan:

<Page>

                                     - 27 -

          3.5.1.    Libor will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
          such Lender of funding such Libor Loan for the relevant Interest
          Period, or

          3.5.2.    deposits in U.S. dollars are not available to such Lender in
          the London interbank market in sufficient amounts in the ordinary
          course of business, or

          3.5.3.    by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank
          market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining Libor
          for the relevant Interest Period;

then the Agent shall forthwith give notice of such determination to the Borrower
and each of the other Lenders, and from and after the date of commencement of
such Interest Period and for so long as such conditions shall continue to exist,
the Borrower shall not have the right to obtain such Libor Loan from such
Lender, and the Borrowing Notice received by the Agent in respect of such Libor
Loan shall, in respect of the Rateable Portion of such Lender, be deemed to be a
request of the Borrower for a Base Rate Loan under the Credit Facility.

3.6.      CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

                 If the introduction of or any change in any Applicable Law
relating to any Lenders, or any change in the interpretation or application
thereof by any Governmental Body or compliance by any Lenders with any request
or direction of any Governmental Body:

          3.6.1.    subjects such Lender to, or causes the withdrawal or
          termination of a previously granted exemption with respect to, any
          Taxes or changes the basis of taxation of payments due to such Lender
          or increases any existing Taxes on payments of the Obligations (other
          than, in each case, Excluded Taxes);

          3.6.2.    imposes, modifies or deems applicable any incremental
          reserve, liquidity, cash margin, capital, special deposit, deposit
          insurance or assessment, or any other regulatory or similar
          requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account
          of, or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds for loans by, such
          Lender;

          3.6.3.    imposes any Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes) on reserves or
          deemed reserves in respect of the undrawn portion of such Lender's
          Rateable Portion of the Credit Facility;

          3.6.4.    imposes on such Lender or requires there to be maintained by
          such Lender any capital adequacy or additional capital requirement
          (including, without limitation, a requirement which affects such
          Lender's allocation of capital resources to its obligations) in
          respect of such Lender's obligations hereunder or imposes any other
          condition or requirement with respect to the maintenance by such
          Lender of a contingent liability with respect to any Letter of Credit
          issued by it hereunder; or

          3.6.5.    imposes on such Lender any other condition or requirement
          with respect to this Agreement or the Credit Facility (other than
          Excluded Taxes);

and such occurrence has the effect of:

          3.6.6.    increasing the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or
          making, maintaining or funding the Credit Facility, any Advance, any
          Loan or any portion thereof;

<Page>

                                     - 28 -

          3.6.7.    reducing the amount of the Obligations;

          3.6.8.    directly or indirectly reducing the effective return to such
          Lender under this Agreement or on its overall capital as a result of
          entering into this Agreement or as a result of any of the transactions
          or obligations contemplated by this Agreement (other than a reduction
          resulting from the imposition of an Excluded Tax, including, without
          limitation a higher rate of income tax or capital tax being imposed on
          such Lender's overall income or assets); or

          3.6.9.    causing such Lender to make any payment or to forego any
          interest, fees or other return on or calculated by reference to any
          sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder;

then such Lender shall, within 90 days of such Lender actually becoming aware of
such increased cost, provide notice thereof to the Agent (with such notice being
accompanied by a certificate of the Lender stating that the Lender is entitled
to claim an amount under this section 3.6 in accordance with the terms hereof,
setting forth the amount necessary to compensate such Lender, a detailed
explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the request of compensation and
a description of the methodology used by the Lender calculating such amounts),
and the Agent shall in each case forthwith advise the Borrower accordingly and
provide a copy of such certificate to the Borrower, and the Borrower shall,
within 30 days of receipt of such certificate from such Lender, pay to the Agent
for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to fully compensate
such Lender for the increased cost set out in such certificate whether as a lump
sum(s) or as an increase in the Applicable Margin, as appropriate; provided,
however, that a Lender claiming additional amounts under this section 3.6 agrees
to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different applicable lending office if the making
of such a designation would avoid the need for, or materially reduce the amount
of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise commercially disadvantageous to
such Lender. If a Lender is not able to obviate its requirement for compensation
under this section 3.6 by designating a different applicable lending office, the
Borrower may elect within such 30-day period to have one or more substitute
Lenders (arranged by the Borrower at its expense) assume, and the Lender shall
promptly after receipt of notice of such election assign, its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to such other
Person chosen by the Borrower in accordance with section 12.9.4 (other than
clause (a) thereof) and provided that all principal, interest and other amounts
owing hereunder are paid in full to such Lender, and all of the Lenders' costs
and expenses are reimbursed for such assignment, if such assignment would allow
the Borrower, either at that time or in the reasonably foreseeable future, to
avoid having to pay such amounts. Such assignment shall be made without recourse
to, warranty by (except as to title) or expense to the assigning Lender except
with respect to past acts of such Lender. No claim for compensation may be made
by a Lender under this section 3.6 unless such Lender is also claiming such
compensation from a majority of its most creditworthy customers with credit
facilities and loans outstanding thereunder similar to the Credit Facility and
Loans outstanding hereunder against whom it is entitled to make such claim. The
above-referenced certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted
to the Borrower by the Agent on behalf of such Lender, shall be PRIMA FACIE
evidence of the amount of compensation required to be paid hereunder by the
Borrower to the Agent for the account of such Lender.

3.7.      ILLEGALITY

                 If the introduction of or change to any present or future
Applicable Law, or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by
any Governmental Body, shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
any Loan or any relevant portion thereof or to give effect to its obligations in
respect of such Loan as contemplated hereby, such Lender may, by notice to the
Borrower and to the

<Page>

                                     - 29 -

Agent, declare that its obligations hereunder in respect of such Loan shall be
terminated, and thereupon, subject as hereinafter provided in this section 3.7,
the Borrower shall prepay to such Lender forthwith (or at the end of such period
to which the Lender shall in its discretion have agreed) all of the Obligations
to such Lender in respect of such Loan including all amounts payable in
connection with such prepayment pursuant to section 3.8. If there are any types
of Loans hereunder that are not so affected, the Borrower may by notice in
writing to the Agent convert the Loans which are affected into one of the types
of Loans that are not so affected. Any repayments made under this section 3.7
shall not reduce any Lender's Commitment or Aggregate Commitment; provided,
however, at its option, the Borrower may permanently and irrevocably reduce or
terminate (as the case may be) the Lender's Commitment of any such Lender on the
giving of such notice (and, for greater certainty, no other Lender shall be
responsible therefor) and the Aggregate Commitment shall be reduced by the
amount and at the time of any prepayment so made.

3.8.      INDEMNITY

          3.8.1.    The Borrower shall indemnify each of the Agent and the
          Lenders and its officers, directors and employees (each, an
          "Indemnified Person") and shall hold each of them harmless from and
          against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and
          reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
          legal fees on a solicitor and his own client basis) (in each case, a
          "Claim") that may be incurred by or asserted as a result of a claim by
          any third party or awarded in favour of a third party against any of
          them, in each case, arising out of, related to, or in connection with,
          or by reason of (a) the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any
          Acquisition undertaken by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or
          (c) any Environmental Law, including (i) the assertion of any Lien
          thereunder, (ii) the presence of any Hazardous Substance affecting any
          Real Property or any adjacent real estate, or (iii) the Release by the
          Borrower or a Subsidiary of any Hazardous Substance into the
          environment. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section
          3.8.1, the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
          Person under this section 3.8.1 for any Claim to the extent that such
          Claim is attributable to:

                 3.8.1.1.  the gross negligence, fraud, wilful misconduct or
                 wilful illegal acts of any Indemnified Person;

                 3.8.1.2.  the failure on the part of any Indemnified Person to
                 perform any of its material covenants or obligations contained
                 in any Loan Document to which it is a party, or a
                 representation or warranty made by any Indemnified Person under
                 the Loan Documents to which it is a party or in any certificate
                 or other document delivered by any Indemnified Person pursuant
                 hereto or in connection with any Loan Document being found to
                 be false or incorrect in any material respect so as to make it
                 materially misleading when made;

                 3.8.1.3.  any Claim of any Lender against any defaulting Lender
                 or any Claim of any Indemnified Person for expenses which such
                 Indemnified Person is obligated to bear hereunder;

                 3.8.1.4.  any Claim to the extent arising from the act of
                 offering, selling, disposing or transferring by any Indemnified
                 Person of all or part of its interest in the Loan Documents,
                 other than to the extent resulting from the Borrower compelling
                 such transfer to a substitute Lender under sections 2.4, 2.6 or
                 2.7;

<Page>

                                     - 30 -

                 3.8.1.5.  to the extent resulting from the failure of the Agent
                 to distribute, in accordance with the terms of any Loan
                 Document, any amounts received and to be distributed by it
                 thereunder, to the extent the Borrower has satisfied all of its
                 obligations in connection therewith; or

                 3.8.1.6.  any Claim of the Agent arising from the act or
                 process of syndicating or selling interests in respect of any
                 of the Loans or Loan Documents, except to the extent such Claim
                 arises from any information provided or failed to be provided
                 by the Borrower to any Indemnified Person.

          3.8.2.    In addition to any other indemnity contained herein or in
          any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for
          all losses, damages, liabilities and reasonable costs and
          out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, any such loss,
          damage, liability, reasonable cost or out-of-pocket expense sustained
          by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment in
          whole or in part of deposits or funds borrowed or acquired by it to
          make its Rateable Portion of any Libor Loan), which such Lender may
          sustain or incur: (i) if for any reason a utilization does not occur
          on a date specified therefor in any Borrowing Notice, (ii) if the
          Borrower fails to give any notice required to be given by it
          hereunder, in the manner and at the time specified herein, (iii) if
          for any reason any payment of any Libor Loan, or any portion thereof,
          occurs on a date which is not a Maturity Date in respect thereof, or
          (iv) as a consequence of any other default by the Borrower to repay
          any Obligations when required by the terms of this Agreement; provided
          that each Lender shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
          mitigate its loss, damage, liability, cost and expense attributable to
          such events and the Borrower's obligation to make payments hereunder
          will be reduced by the amount earned by each Lender in mitigating its
          loss, damage, liability, cost or expense. A certificate of the
          relevant Lender setting forth the amounts necessary to indemnify such
          Lender in respect of such losses, damages, liabilities, reasonable
          costs or out-of-pocket expenses shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the
          amounts owing under this section 3.8.2.

          3.8.3.    The Borrower's obligations and indemnification under this
          section 3.8 shall survive the payment and satisfaction of all
          Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. The Agent and the
          Lenders shall hold the benefit of this indemnity in trust for those
          indemnified parties who are not parties to this Agreement.

3.9.             PROCEEDINGS IN RESPECT OF CLAIMS

          3.9.1.    If a Claim is made against an Indemnified Person as to which
          the Borrower may have an indemnification obligation under section
          3.8.1, such Indemnified Person shall notify the Borrower of the Claim;
          provided that the failure to provide such notice promptly shall not
          release the Borrower from any of its obligations to indemnify unless
          (and only to the extent) such failure shall prevent the Borrower from
          contesting, or materially and adversely affects the ability of the
          Borrower to conduct a contest of, such Claim.

          3.9.2.    The Indemnified Person shall be entitled, in its discretion,
          to require the Borrower to prosecute, at the Borrower's own cost and
          expense, the entire defence of such Indemnified Person against any
          Claim by a third party for which such Indemnified Person is
          indemnified under section 3.8.1. In addition, upon delivery by the
          Borrower to such Indemnified Person of a written acknowledgement of
          the Borrower's obligations to indemnify such Indemnified Person in
          accordance with the terms of this Agreement in respect of such Claim,
          the Borrower shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in,
          and, to the extent that the Borrower desires, to

<Page>

                                     - 31 -

          assume and control the defence thereof through its own counsel (who
          shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnified
          Person); provided, however, that if the Borrower is controlling any
          proceedings, the Borrower shall keep such Indemnified Person fully
          apprised of the status of such proceedings and shall provide such
          Indemnified Person with all information with respect to such
          proceedings as such Indemnified Person shall reasonably request. The
          Borrower must indicate its election to assume such defence by written
          notice to the Indemnified Person within 30 days following receipt of
          Indemnified Person's notice of the Claim, or in the case of a third
          party Claim which requires a shorter time for response then within
          such shorter period as specified in the Indemnified Person's notice of
          Claim, provided that such Indemnified Person has given the Borrower
          notice thereof. The Indemnified Person may participate at its own
          expense and with its own counsel (provided that all Indemnified
          Parties shall use the same counsel) in any proceeding conducted by the
          Borrower in accordance with the foregoing; provided the Borrower shall
          in any event remain liable hereunder in respect of the Claim. The
          Borrower shall not be entitled to assume and control (but may, at its
          own expense, participate in) the defence of any such Claim if and to
          the extent that:

                 3.9.2.1.  in the reasonable opinion of such Indemnified Person
                 acting in good faith,

                         3.9.2.1.1.  such proceeding involves any risk of
                         imposition of criminal liability on such Indemnified
                         Person; or

                         3.9.2.1.2.  such proceeding involves any risk of
                         impairment to the reputation of the Indemnified Person
                         in any material respect; or

                         3.9.2.1.3.  the control of such action, suit or
                         proceeding would involve an actual or potential
                         conflict of interest, such that it is advisable for
                         such Indemnified Person to be represented by separate
                         counsel; or

                 3.9.2.2.  such proceeding involves Claims not fully indemnified
                 by the Borrower which the Borrower and the Indemnified Person
                 have been unable to sever from the indemnified Claim(s).


          Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this Section 3.9.2, in any of
          the circumstances set out in Sections 3.9.2.1 or 3.9.2.2, the
          Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assume the defence of such
          Claim with counsel selected by it (provided that all Indemnified
          Parties shall use the same counsel) and the reasonable fees and
          out-of-pocket expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Borrower;
          provided, that the Borrower shall in any event remain liable hereunder
          in respect of the indemnified Claim.

          3.9.3.    Except in the circumstances described in section 3.9.2.1.3,
          the Borrower may enter into any settlement or other compromise with
          respect to any Claim in respect of which it has an indemnity payment
          obligation under section 3.8.1 without the prior written consent of
          the Indemnified Person, except in the case of a settlement involving
          an admission of liability of such Indemnified Person, in which case
          the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person shall be obtained,
          provided that if such Indemnified Person withholds its consent to such
          settlement and the required admission of liability of such Indemnified
          Person is not in favour of a Governmental Body other than a court,
          would not give rise to the imposition of any penalty or sanction
          against the Indemnified Person by any Governmental Body, is not in
          respect of any criminal liability and would not otherwise impair the
          reputation of the Indemnified Person in any material respect, the

<Page>

                                     - 32 -

          maximum amount of liability of the Borrower to the Indemnified Person
          with respect to such Claim shall not exceed the amount of the proposed
          settlement rejected by such Indemnified Person. Unless an Event of
          Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no Indemnified Person
          shall enter into any settlement or other compromise with respect to
          any Claim for which the Borrower has in writing agreed to fully
          indemnify under section 3.8.1 without the prior written consent of the
          Borrower, which consent may be withheld in the Borrower's sole
          discretion, unless such Indemnified Person waives its right to be
          indemnified under section 3.8.1, with respect to such Claim.

          3.9.4.    Each Indemnified Person shall supply the Borrower with such
          information and documents reasonably requested by the Borrower as are
          necessary or advisable for the Borrower to participate in any action,
          suit or proceeding to the extent permitted above, and the Borrower
          shall reimburse the Indemnified Person for the reasonable costs and
          out-of-pocket expenses of supplying such information and documents,
          all within a reasonable period of time following the Borrower's
          request therefor.

          3.9.5.    Upon payment in full of any Claim pursuant to section 3.8.1
          to or on behalf of an Indemnified Person, the Borrower, without any
          further action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such
          Indemnified Person may have relating thereto (other than claims in
          respect of insurance policies maintained by such Indemnified Person at
          its own expense). Each Indemnified Person agrees, at the Borrower's
          reasonable request and expense, to give such further assurances or
          agreements and to otherwise cooperate with the Borrower to enable the
          Borrower to vigorously pursue such claims.

          3.9.6.    Any amount payable to an Indemnified Person pursuant to
          section 3.8 shall be paid to such Indemnified Person within 30 days of
          the receipt (or deemed receipt) by the Borrower of a written request
          therefor from such Indemnified Person, accompanied by a written
          statement describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity
          and the computation of the amount so payable; provided that payment of
          an indemnity in respect of a third party Claim need not be made until
          payment is due, whether by compromise, settlement, court proceedings,
          arbitration or otherwise, from the Indemnified Person in respect of
          such third party Claim.

3.9.      EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

                 The Agent shall maintain and keep, at its Branch of Account,
accounts showing the amount of all Loans advanced by each of the Lenders, from
time to time and the dates thereof and the interest, fees and other charges
accrued thereon or applicable thereto from time to time, and all payments of
principal (including prepayments), interest and fees and other payments made by
the Borrower to the Agent from time to time under the Credit Facility. Such
accounts maintained by the Agent on behalf of itself and each of the Lenders
shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the matters recorded therein.

3.10.     SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS

                 The obligations of each Lender under this Agreement are
several. No Lender shall be responsible for any failure or alleged failure on
the part of any other Lender to duly perform its obligations under the terms of
this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor shall the obligations of the Borrower
to any Lender be diminished or affected by any failure or alleged failure on the
part of any other Lender to duly perform its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement or any Loan Document.

                                   ARTICLE 4.
                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.1.      PROCEDURES RELATING TO LETTERS OF CREDIT

          4.1.1.    Each Letter of Credit shall be issued by the L/C Lender in
          its name as an L/C Loan.

          4.1.2.    Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Borrower may
          not request the issuance of any Letter of Credit having a term which
          would extend beyond the Termination Date.

          4.1.3.    At no time shall the aggregate amount of all Letters of
          Credit outstanding under the Credit Facility exceed the L/C Limit.

4.2.      REIMBURSEMENT

          4.2.1.    The Borrower unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes the
          L/C Lender to pay the amount of any demand made on the L/C Lender
          under and in accordance with the terms of any Letter of Credit on
          request without requiring proof of the Borrower's agreement that the
          amount so demanded was due and notwithstanding that the Borrower may
          dispute the validity of any such demand or payment.

          4.2.2.    The Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Lender on request for
          any amounts paid by it from time to time as contemplated by section
          4.2.1 and, without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower shall
          indemnify and save the L/C Lender harmless on demand from and against
          any and all other losses (including lost profits), costs, damages,
          expenses, claims, demands or liabilities which it may suffer or incur
          arising in any manner whatsoever in connection with the making of any
          such payments as contemplated by section 4.2.1 (including, without
          limitation, in connection with proceedings to restrain the L/C Lender
          from making, or to compel the L/C Lender to make, any such payment).

4.3.      L/C LENDER NOT LIABLE

          4.3.1.    The L/C Lender shall not have any responsibility or
          liability for, or duty to inquire into, the authorization, execution,
          signature, endorsement, correctness, genuineness or legal effect of
          any certificate or other document presented to the L/C Lender pursuant
          to any Letter of Credit other than to ensure that any request for
          payment under a Letter of Credit is in compliance with the terms
          thereof and the Borrower fully and unconditionally assumes all risks
          with respect to the same and, without limiting the generality of the
          foregoing, all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary of
          any Letter of Credit with respect to the use by any beneficiary of any
          Letter of Credit provided the L/C Lender complied with the terms of
          such Letter of Credit. The L/C Lender shall not be responsible:

                 4.3.1.1.  for the validity of certificates or other documents
                 delivered under or in connection with any Letter of Credit that
                 appear on their face to be in order, even if such certificates
                 or other documents should in fact prove to be invalid,
                 fraudulent or forged provided the L/C Lender complied with the
                 terms of such Letter of Credit;

                 4.3.1.2.  for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
                 transmission or delivery of any messages by mail, cable,
                 telegraph, telefax or otherwise, whether or not they are in
                 code;

<Page>

                 4.3.1.3.  for errors in translation or for errors in
                 interpretation of technical terms or for errors in the
                 calculation of amounts demanded under any Letter of Credit;

                 4.3.1.4.  for any failure or inability of the L/C Lender or any
                 other Person to make payment under any Letter of Credit as a
                 result of any Applicable Law or by reason of any control or
                 restriction rightfully or wrongfully exercised by any Person
                 asserting or exercising governmental or paramount powers; or

                 4.3.1.5.  for any other consequences arising in respect of a
                 failure by the L/C Lender to honour a Letter of Credit due to
                 causes beyond the control of the L/C Lender;

          and none of the above shall affect or impair any of the rights or
          powers of the Lenders hereunder or the obligations of the Borrower
          under section 4.2.2. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
          foregoing provisions, it is agreed that any payment made by the L/C
          Lender in good faith under and in accordance with the terms of a
          Letter of Credit shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not
          result in any liability of the Agent or any of the Lenders to the
          Borrower and shall not lessen the obligations of the Borrower under
          section 4.2.2.

          4.3.2.    Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 4.3, the
          Borrower shall not be responsible for, and the L/C Lender shall not be
          relieved of responsibility for, any wilful misconduct, gross
          negligence, fraud or illegal acts of the L/C Lender or the failure of
          the L/C Lender to comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit.

4.4.      LETTER OF CREDIT FEES

                 The Borrower shall pay the Letter of Credit Fee to the L/C
Lender in advance in quarterly instalments (except that the first such
instalment shall be in respect of the period from the date the Letter of Credit
is issued to the last day of the then current Fiscal Quarter) for the period
from and including the date of issuance of the Letter of Credit to and including
the stated expiry date thereof, on an amount equal to the stated amount of the
Letter of Credit, with the first such payment due and payable on the date of
issuance of the applicable Letter of Credit. Upon a change to the Letter of
Credit Fee for any Fiscal Quarter, occurring as a result of an adjustment to the
Applicable Margin for Libor Loans for such Fiscal Quarter, the Letter of Credit
Fee shall be retroactively adjusted to the first day of the then current Fiscal
Quarter (or, in the case of the first instalment in respect of the applicable
Letter of Credit Fee, to the date of issuance of the Letter of Credit). Where
there has been an adjustment to the Applicable Margin for Libor Loans, then on
the date on which the next instalment in respect of the Letter of Credit Fee is
due and payable or if no such fee is payable, within 10 Business Days of the
receipt of notice from one party to the other requesting payment, or refund of
an overpayment, of a Letter of Credit Fee: (i) the L/C Lender shall pay to the
Borrower an amount equal to any overpayment by the Borrower in respect of the
Letter of Credit Fee for the then current Fiscal Quarter, or (ii) the Borrower
shall pay to the L/C Lender an amount equal to any underpayment by the Borrower
in respect of the Letter of Credit Fee for the then current Fiscal Quarter, as
the case may be. If the Letter of Credit is drawn, in whole or in part, is
withdrawn or otherwise ceases to have effect (other than due to an Event of
Default) prior to its stated expiry date, the L/C Lender shall reimburse the
Borrower for any overpaid Letter of Credit Fee within 30 days of such
occurrence. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of
such early expiry, the amount of such overpaid Letter of Credit Fee shall be
paid by the L/C Lender to the Agent to be applied thereby in accordance with
section 9.3.

4.5.      OVERDUE AMOUNTS

                 Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, if the
Borrower shall fail to reimburse the L/C Lender in respect of any payments made
by the L/C Lender under a Letter of Credit as contemplated in section 4.2.2, the
L/C Lender may at any time thereafter notify the Agent (which shall thereupon
deliver a similar notice to each of the Lenders which has a Lender's Commitment)
of such failure and such notification shall be deemed to have been delivery of a
Borrowing Notice in the amount of such payments on and subject to the terms
hereof. Each Lender that has a Lender's Commitment shall forthwith credit the
account of the L/C Lender with such Lender's Rateable Portion of such payments,
the amount of such payments shall be deemed to constitute a Base Rate Loan made
by the Lenders under the Credit Facility and which is outstanding, and, without
limiting the terms and conditions applicable to such Base Rate Loan, shall be
due and payable when a Base Rate Loan is due and payable in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

4.6.      ACCELERATION

                 Upon the Agent making a declaration under section 9.2, the
maximum amount of the contingent liability of the L/C Lender under any Letter of
Credit which is then outstanding shall immediately become due and payable
notwithstanding that the L/C Lender has not at such date been required to make
payment under any such Letter of Credit. Any such amount deposited with the L/C
Lender shall be held by the L/C Lender and invested on behalf of the Borrower in
an interest-bearing investment (or investments) as security for the repayment of
future indebtedness of the Borrower to the L/C Lender in respect of Letters of
Credit which are drawn down pending the expiry of all outstanding Letters of
Credit.

4.7.      CONFLICT

                 Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the L/C Lender's
customary letter of credit terms and procedures from time to time in effect and
shall be in a form acceptable to the L/C Lender. The Borrower shall execute and
deliver such standard form applications, agreements, indemnities, bonds and
other assurances as the L/C Lender may reasonably require from time to time with
respect to Letters of Credit (each, a "Letter of Credit Agreement"). A Letter of
Credit shall in no event contain provisions requiring the L/C Lender to satisfy
itself, prior to payment thereunder, as to any conditions for a drawing
thereunder other than the presentation of prescribed documents. If the
provisions set forth in the L/C Lender's customary letter of credit
documentation set forth terms beyond or inconsistent with that set forth herein,
the provisions of this Agreement in respect thereof shall prevail.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any inconsistency between the terms
of a Letter of Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits as most recently published by the International
Chamber of Commerce (the "ICP") or The International Standby Practices as most
recently approved by the International Chamber of Commerce Banking Commission
(the "ISP"), then the terms of the UCP or ISP, as applicable, shall prevail to
the extent of the inconsistency.

          5.1.2.    Libor Loans shall bear interest at Libor plus the Applicable
          Margin.

5.2.      CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST

          5.2.1.    Interest on Base Rate Loans shall accrue from day to day,
          both before and after default, demand, maturity and judgment, shall be
          calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and on
          the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and shall
          be payable to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in U.S. dollars
          in arrears on the first Banking Day of each month. For greater
          certainty, where the rate applicable to a Base Rate Loan is changed,
          interest shall be charged for the day on which such change is
          effective on the basis of the new rate.

          5.2.2.    Interest on Libor Loans shall accrue from day to day, both
          before and after default, demand, maturity and judgement, shall be

          the basis of a year of 360 days, and shall be payable to the Agent for
          the account of the Lenders, in arrears on the last day of the relevant
          Interest Period.

5.3.      STAND-BY FEE

                 The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders on the third Banking Day following the end of each Fiscal Quarter, in
arrears, a stand-by fee on the amount, if any, by which the Aggregate Commitment
exceeds the amount of the Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility on each
day in such Fiscal Quarter equal to the rate per annum set out in Schedule 1.1.8
corresponding to the ratio of Total Funded Debt to EBITDA as calculated at the
beginning of such Fiscal Quarter (and based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be).

5.4.      PAYMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES

                 Whether or not the Borrower takes advantage of the Credit
Facility, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for itself and, if applicable,
each of the Lenders, on demand the following costs and expenses:

          5.4.1.    all reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent
          in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of the
          Loan Documents, any actual or proposed amendment or modification
          hereof or thereof or any waiver hereunder or thereunder and all
          instruments supplemental or ancillary thereto and all reasonable
          documented due diligence expenses incurred in connection therewith;

          5.4.2.    all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection

          5.4.3.    all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and Lenders
          in connection with the defence, establishment, protection or
          enforcement of any of the rights or remedies of the Agent or any of
          the Lenders under the Loan Documents including, without limitation,
          all costs and expenses of establishing the validity and enforceability
          of, or of collection of amounts owing under, any of the Loan Documents
          and all reasonable costs and expenses of any receiver or
          receiver-manager appointed by the Agent or any of the Lenders or by a
          court in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents;

<Page>

                                     - 37 -

including, without limitation, all of the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Agent, the Lenders and any such receiver or receiver-manager, on
a solicitor and his own client basis, incurred in connection therewith, and all
proper and reasonable compensation paid to any counsel, accountant or other
expert retained or employed by the Agent pursuant hereto and including all
sales, goods and services or value-added taxes payable by any of them on all
such costs, expenses and compensation.

5.5.      INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS

                 If any Obligations are not paid when due or an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, all amounts owing or deemed to be owing
hereunder, whether in respect of principal, interest, fees, expenses or
otherwise, both before and after judgment, and in the case of expenses from the
dates such expenses are invoiced to the Borrower, shall bear interest at a rate
per annum determined on a daily basis that is equal to the Base Rate plus (in
each case) 2% per annum, in each case calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days or 366 days, as the case may be.
Such interest shall accrue from day to day, be payable in arrears on demand and
shall be compounded monthly on the last Banking Day of each calendar month.

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

6.1.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                 The Borrower represents and warrants to the Agent on behalf of
the Lenders as follows:

          6.1.1.    INCORPORATION AND STATUS. Each of the Borrower and the
          Material Subsidiaries is duly incorporated, formed or organized, as
          the case may be, and validly existing under the laws of its
          jurisdiction of incorporation, formation or organization, as the case
          may be, and has the power and capacity to own its properties and
          assets and to carry on its business as presently carried on by it or
          as contemplated hereunder to be carried on by it. As of May 1, 2002,
          the Borrower did not carry on any material business other than its
          ownership of the Subsidiaries and the other investments set out in
          section 6.1.26. As of May 1, 2002, none of the Material Subsidiaries
          carried on any business other than the Core Line of Business and other
          than the ownership or operation of casinos, hotels, resorts, card
          clubs, sports bars, restaurants and theatres, all of which activities
          are associated with or ancillary or related to the Core Line of
          Business, and the ownership and management of a portfolio of real
          estate properties held for development or sale. As of May 1, 2002 the
          Borrower and each Material Subsidiary held all Material
          Authorizations, all of which were in good standing on such date;

          6.1.2.    POWER AND CAPACITY. Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors
          has the power and capacity to enter into each of the Loan Documents to
          which it is a party and to do all acts and things as are required or
          contemplated hereunder or thereunder to be done, observed and
          performed by it;

          6.1.3.    DUE AUTHORIZATION. Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors
          has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery
          and performance of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party;

          6.1.4.    REGISTRATION STATEMENT. At May 1, 2002, the Registration
          Statement complied in all material respects with the applicable
          provisions of the Securities Acts and does not contain an

<Page>

                                     - 38 -

          untrue statement of a material fact and does not omit to state any
          material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
          make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
          circumstances under which they were made;

          6.1.5.    NO UNANIMOUS SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT. There is no unanimous
          shareholder agreement with respect to any Material Subsidiary that is
          not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Borrower which
          restricts, in whole or in part, the powers of the directors of the
          Material Subsidiary to manage or supervise the business and affairs of
          the Material Subsidiary;

          6.1.6.    NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution and delivery of each of the
          Loan Documents and the performance by each of the Borrower and the
          Guarantors of its obligations thereunder (i) do not and will not
          contravene, breach or result in any default under (a) the articles,
          by-laws, constating documents or other organizational documents of the
          Borrower or any Guarantor, (b) any Material Authorization or
          Applicable Law, or (c) any material mortgage, lease, agreement or
          other legally binding instrument to which the Borrower or a Material
          Subsidiary was, as of May 1, 2002, a party or by which the Borrower or
          Material Subsidiary or any of its properties or assets were bound as
          of such date, (ii) will not oblige the Borrower or any Material
          Subsidiary to grant any Lien to any Person other than the Lenders, and
          (iii) will not result in or permit the acceleration of the maturity of
          any material indebtedness, liability or obligation of the Borrower or
          any Material Subsidiary under any mortgage, lease, agreement or other
          legally binding instrument of or affecting the Borrower or any
          Material Subsidiary;

          6.1.7.    NO CONSENTS REQUIRED. Other than filings with the Securities
          Commission, no Material Authorization is required in connection with
          the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Loan Documents by
          the Borrower or any Guarantor;

          6.1.8.    ENFORCEABILITY. Each of the Loan Documents constitutes, or
          upon execution and delivery will constitute, a valid and binding
          obligation of the Borrower and each Guarantor which is a party to it
          enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject only to
          the qualifications set out in the opinion of Borrower's counsel
          delivered pursuant to section 8.1.4.5;

          6.1.9.    TITLE. Subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and except as
          otherwise disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Agent, the
          Borrower and (where applicable) each Material Subsidiary is the
          absolute beneficial owner of and has good and marketable title in fee
          simple to, or has a good and marketable leasehold interest to, all of
          the real property, in each case, necessary to permit the operation of
          its Core Line of Business in the ordinary course where the failure to
          so own or lease such real property could reasonably be expected to
          have a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "Real Property"). As
          of May 1, 2002, Schedule 6.1.9 of the Disclosure Letter contained an
          accurate and complete list of the municipal addresses of all Real
          Property owned or leased by the Borrower and each Material Subsidiary.
          As of May 1, 2002, the Borrower and (where applicable) each Material
          Subsidiary was the beneficial owner, lessee or licensee, as the case
          may be, of all of its other real and personal property and has good
          title thereto, or other applicable interest therein, free and clear of
          any Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, in each case, necessary
          to permit the operation of its Core Line of Business in the ordinary
          course where the failure to have any such interest in such property
          could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

          6.1.10.   ZONING AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO REAL PROPERTY. All
          buildings and other structures located on the Real Property and the
          operation and maintenance thereof, as operated and maintained on May
          1, 2002, were in compliance on May 1, 2002, in all material respects,

<Page>

                                     - 39 -

          with all Applicable Laws relating to zoning and land use; none of such
          buildings or other structures encroaches upon any land not owned or
          leased by the Borrower or a Material Subsidiary; there are no
          restrictive covenants or Applicable Laws which in any way restrict or
          prohibit the use of such Real Property, buildings or structures for
          the purposes for which they were being used on May 1, 2002; on May 1,
          2002 there were no expropriation or similar proceedings, actual or
          threatened, of which the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary has
          received notice against any of such Real Property or any part thereof,
          in all cases, where the existence and continuance of any such
          non-compliance, encroachment, restriction or proceeding could
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

          6.1.11.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                 6.1.11.1. The Audited Financial Statements have been prepared
                 in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the financial
                 position and results of operations of the Borrower and its
                 Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the dates indicated
                 and for the periods specified;

                 6.1.11.2. The pro forma financial information, including the
                 notes thereto, included in the Registration Statement have been
                 prepared in accordance with applicable requirements of the
                 Securities Acts. The assumptions used in preparing such pro
                 forma financial statements provide a reasonable basis for
                 presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the
                 transactions or events described therein, the related pro forma
                 adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and
                 the pro forma columns therein reflect a proper application of
                 those adjustments to the corresponding historical financial
                 statement amounts;

          6.1.12.   NON-ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS. Except as described in the
          Registration Statement, or as set forth in Schedule 6.1.12 of the
          Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the
          Agent, since the date of the last financial statements delivered to
          the Agent prior to May 1, 2002, neither the Borrower nor any of its
          Material Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction or agreement
          with any Affiliate which is not the Borrower or a Material Subsidiary;

          6.1.13.   NO LITIGATION. Except as described in the Registration
          Statement, or as set forth in Schedule 6.1.13 of the Disclosure Letter
          or as disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Agent, there is no:
          court, administrative, regulatory or similar proceeding (whether
          civil, quasi-criminal, or criminal); arbitration or other dispute
          settlement procedure; investigation or enquiry by any Governmental
          Body; or any similar matter or proceeding (collectively "proceedings")
          against or involving the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary (whether
          in progress or threatened) which, if determined adversely to the
          Borrower or Material Subsidiary, could reasonably be expected to have
          a Material Adverse Effect or which purports to affect the legality,
          validity and enforceability of any Loan Document; to the Borrower's
          knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any
          Governmental Body or other Person; and, to the Borrower's knowledge,
          no event has occurred which could reasonably be expected to give rise
          to any such proceedings and, as of May 1, 2002, there was no judgment,
          decree, injunction, rule, award or order of any Governmental Body
          outstanding against the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries
          which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
          Adverse Effect;

          6.1.14.   NO DEFAULT. Except as described in the Registration
          Statement, as at May 1, 2002 neither the Borrower nor any Material
          Subsidiary was in default or breach under any Applicable

<Page>

                                     - 40 -

          Law or under any material agreement, commitment or obligation or under
          the terms and conditions relating to any Material Authorizations which
          could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and,
          except as disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Agent, there
          exists no state of facts which, after notice or the passage of time or
          both, would constitute such a default or breach; and, as of May 1,
          2002, there were no proceedings in progress, pending or threatened
          which could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
          cancellation, suspension or any adverse modification of any Material

          any horse owners or trainers exists or, to the knowledge of the

          qualifications set out in such opinion and to any other qualifications
          which in the reasonable opinion of the Borrower's counsel are required
          by law;

7.3.      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

          7.3.1.    The Borrower shall maintain, for itself and its Material
          Subsidiaries, a system to ensure and monitor continued compliance with
          Environmental Laws, which shall include reviews of such compliance,
          and the maintenance, in all material respects, of environmental
          documents and records relating to their respective businesses as
          required by Environmental Law.

          7.3.2.    The Borrower shall comply, and shall take all necessary
          corporate or other action to cause any of its Material Subsidiaries to
          comply with all Environmental Laws except where the failure to do so
          could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          7.3.3.    The Borrower covenants and agrees that it and each Material
          Subsidiary shall not cause or permit a Release of any Hazardous
          Substance except in compliance, in all material respects, with
          Environmental Laws or that would not reasonably be expected to lead to
          material liability under Environmental Laws against the Borrower or a
          Subsidiary.

          7.3.4.    The Borrower covenants and agrees that it and each Material
          Subsidiary shall not knowingly permit, and shall use reasonable
          commercial efforts to prevent any person, including but not limited to
          any invitee, occupant or tenant of or on any Real Property or any part
          thereof, to engage in any activity (or fail to take action), which is
          likely to lead to the imposition of material liability under any
          Environmental Laws against the Borrower or a Subsidiary which would
          have a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower.

          7.3.5.    The Borrower shall, and shall take all necessary corporate
          action to cause each Material Subsidiary to, promptly remove any
          Hazardous Substance (or if removal is prohibited by any Environmental
          Law, the Borrower or applicable Material Subsidiary shall take
          whatever action is required to ensure compliance with such
          Environmental Law) from any Real Property (or neighbouring lands where
          the Hazardous Substance has come from the Real Property) to the extent
          required by Environmental Law where the failure to do so could
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
          Borrower or any Material Subsidiary.

          7.3.6.    The Borrower shall provide the Agent with an environmental
          audit report (which shall include a report arising from an
          environmental site assessment, investigation or environmental review)
          with respect to any Real Property or an update of such audit (i) upon
          the written request of the Agent on behalf of the Lenders documenting
          its reasonable opinion that the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary
          may not be in material compliance with this section 7.3; (ii) if such
          audit is required by any Governmental Body or (iii) if an Event of
          Default relating to an environmental matter has occurred, and the
          Agent on behalf of the Lenders has made a reasonable written request
          to the Borrower for such audit or update to address the Event of
          Default within 60 days after such request, and all such audits or
          updates thereof shall be at the Borrower's expense.

          7.3.7.    If the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary (i) receives
          notice that any violation of any Environmental Law may have been
          committed or is about to be committed by it, (ii) receives notice that
          any administrative or judicial complaint or order has been filed or is

          case where the ultimate liability of the Borrower or any Material
          Subsidiary which may arise from such notice could reasonably be
          expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower shall, and
          shall take all necessary corporate action to cause each Material
          Subsidiary to, provide the Agent with a copy of such notice within

          satisfactory to the Agent, acting reasonably, of disbursements made
          from time to time to effect and complete such clean-up or remedial
          action, including within such time as may be prescribed by a
          Governmental Body. The Borrower shall, and shall take all necessary
          corporate action to cause each Material Subsidiary to, provide written
          evidence to the Agent, including a report which the Agent and the
          Lenders shall expressly be entitled to rely on, confirming the
          completion of the clean-up or remediation of a site with a cost in
          excess of $5,000,000, including any investigations and monitoring.

          7.3.8.    The Borrower shall, and shall take all necessary corporate
          action to cause each Material Subsidiary to, permit the Agent and its
          authorized employees, representatives and agents, at reasonable times
          and during normal business hours and at the Agent's own cost, upon
          giving reasonable notice, to visit and inspect any Real Property where
          the Agent or any Lender, in its reasonable opinion, believes that the
          Borrower or any Material Subsidiary may not be in compliance with
          section 7.3.7.

                         EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

9.1.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT

          payment of money to the Agent or any Lender and such default continues
          for a period of 20 days after the earliest of (x) receipt of notice
          from the Agent of such default, and

<Page>

                                     - 54 -

          executive officer, chief financial officer, controller, general
          counsel or secretary of the Borrower, unless:

               (i)    such default is not capable of being cured within such 20
                      day period;

               (ii)   the Borrower is diligently and in good faith advancing to
                      remedy such default; and

               (iii)  such default is in fact remedied within 40 days from
                      expiry of the original 20 day cure period;

          9.1.3.    the representation and warranty set out in Section 6.1.4
          hereof is found to be false or incorrect in any material respect so as
          to make it materially misleading when made or deemed to have been made
          or any other representation or warranty made by the Borrower or any
          Guarantor herein or in any Officer's Certificate or other document
          delivered to the Agent or any Lender pursuant hereto or in connection
          with any Loan Document is found to be false or incorrect in any

          9.1.4.    any event shall occur or condition shall exist, and shall
          continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in any
          agreement or instrument relating to any indebtedness or liability of
          the Borrower (other than Obligations) and the effect of such event or
          condition is to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or
          liability of the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary which is
          outstanding in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $5,000,000, or
          any such indebtedness or liability of the Borrower or any Material

          the stated maturity thereof; provided, in each case, that it shall not
          be an Event of Default if the Borrower or applicable Material
          Subsidiary is diligently contesting such acceleration or declaration
          in good faith by appropriate proceedings or has fully repaid the
          indebtedness accelerated or declared due but it is acknowledged that
          in such circumstances such acceleration or declaration shall
          nevertheless be a Default which would enable the Agent to restrict
          payments to holders of Subordinated Debt pursuant to section 7.2.6;

          9.1.5.    the Borrower admits in writing or by way of a public or

                 of it or any of its property or debt or making a proposal or
                 application with respect to it under any law relating to
                 bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or compromise of debts

                 reorganization, arrangement or compromise of debt under the
                 laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation);

          9.1.7.    any proceeding is commenced against or affecting the
          Borrower:

<Page>

                                     - 55 -

                 or compromise of debt under the laws of its jurisdiction of
                 incorporation); or

                 9.1.7.3.  seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, agent,
                 custodian or other similar official for it or for any
                 substantial part of its properties and assets; and

          in each case, such proceeding is not being contested in good faith by
          appropriate proceedings or, if so contested, remains outstanding,
          undismissed and unstayed more than 45 days from the institution of
          such first mentioned proceeding; provided, in each case, the Borrower
          and its Material Subsidiaries remain current on their respective
          payroll obligations during such contest;

          9.1.8.    any creditor of the Borrower or any other Person shall
          privately appoint a receiver, trustee or similar official for any

          in each case, the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries remain
          current on their respective payroll obligations during such contest;

          9.1.9.    any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of
          $10,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower which remains
          unsatisfied and (i) executions shall have been levied on any property
          of the Borrower by or on behalf of any creditor in reliance on such
          judgment or order and (ii) there shall be any period during which a
          stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending

          9.1.10.   if, at any time after execution and delivery thereof, other
          than by reason of a wilful act or omission of the Agent or any Lender,
          (i) any Loan Document ceases to be in full force and effect (unless

          the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under such Guaranty.

<Page>

                                     - 57 -

          10.1.2.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
          Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part
          of the Guaranteed Obligations that would be owed by the Borrowers to
          the Agent or the Lenders under the Loan Documents but for the fact
          that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a
          bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the
          Borrower.

          10.1.3.   Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in any Guaranty,
          or in any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, if the
          obligations of any Guarantor hereunder exceed the limitations imposed
          under any Fraudulent Transfer Law, then such obligations of the
          Guarantor shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the
          largest amount that would not render its obligations subject to
          avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of
          Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of
          comparable state law (collectively, the "Fraudulent Transfer Laws"),
          in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of the
          Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the
          Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any
          liabilities of the Guarantor in respect of indebtedness to the
          Borrower or any other Person that is an Affiliate of the Borrower to
          the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount
          equal to the amount paid by the Guarantor in respect of the
          Obligations) and after giving effect (as assets) to the value (as
          determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer
          Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or
          contribution of the Guarantor pursuant to Applicable Law or pursuant
          to the terms of any agreement.

10.2.     GUARANTY ABSOLUTE

                 Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will
be paid in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any
law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or the Lenders with
respect thereto. The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty are
independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of the
Borrower or any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents, and a separate action
or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor to enforce this
Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor or whether the Borrower or any other Guarantor is joined in
any such action or actions. The liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty
shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives to the extent permitted by applicable law,
any defenses it may now or hereinafter have in any way relating to, any or all
of the following:

          (a)  any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or
               any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (b)  any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
               other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
               other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any
               Loan Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the
               Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional
               credit to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise;

          (c)  any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
               structure or existence of the Borrower or any of its
               Subsidiaries; or

<Page>

                                     - 58 -

          (d)  any other circumstance or any existence of or reliance on any
               representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise
               constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
               Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.

                 This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations made, with respect to the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned by the Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not
been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent acknowledges on behalf of
the Lenders that the guarantees given by Laurel Racing Assoc., Inc., Laurel
Racing Association Limited Partnership, Pimlico Racing Association, Inc., and
The Maryland Jockey Club of Baltimore City are given subject to a subordination
and intercreditor agreement in favour of Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust
Company, as the same may be amended, modified or restated from time to time.

10.3.     WAIVER

                 Each Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender
exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person.
Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits
from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the
waiver set forth in this section 10.3 is knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

10.4.     CONTINUING GUARANTY; ASSIGNMENTS

                 This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in
full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations, (b) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns and
(c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Lenders, the Agent and
their respective successors and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing clause (c), any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all or any
portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including, without limitation,
all or any portion of its Lender's Commitment and the Advances owing to it) to
any assignee pursuant to and in accordance with section 12.9, and such assignee
shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender herein or otherwise.

10.5.     SUBROGATION

                 No Guarantor will exercise any rights that it may now or
hereafter acquire against the Borrower or any other Guarantor that arise from
the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of any Guarantor's
Obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution
or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Agent or any Lender against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any
collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from the Borrower or any other Guarantor, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until
all of the Loans and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have
been paid in full in cash and the Aggregate Commitment shall have expired or
terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the
preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the

<Page>

                                     - 59 -

Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and
shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to be credited and applied to the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty,
whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other
amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) any Guarantor
shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in full in cash, the Agent and
the Lenders will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver
to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without
representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to
such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such
payment by such Guarantor.

                                   ARTICLE 11.
             THE AGENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY

11.1.     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION

          11.1.1.   Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
          Agent to be its attorney in its name and on its behalf to exercise
          such rights or powers granted to such Lender under this Agreement and
          the other Loan Documents on the terms hereof and thereof, together
          with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender
          hereby authorizes the Agent to execute, as agent for and on its
          behalf, any of the other Loan Documents wherein it is expressly
          stipulated that the Agent is acting in such capacity, and each Lender
          agrees to be bound thereby as principal.

          11.1.2.   As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
          Agreement or the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
          enforcement thereof), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any
          discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
          refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
          refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders,
          and such instructions shall be binding upon all of the Lenders. The
          Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent
          to liability in such capacity, which could result in the Agent's
          incurring any costs and expenses not contemplated by this Agreement or
          which is contrary to this Agreement or Applicable Law.

          11.1.3.   The Agent shall have no duties or obligations other than as
          expressed herein, which duties are solely of a mechanical and
          administrative nature. Without limiting the generality of the
          foregoing, the Agent does not undertake, and the Lenders relieve the
          Agent from, any implied duties, responsibilities, obligations or
          functions and there shall not be construed against the Agent any
          implied covenants or terms, whether in respect of matters arising
          prior to, on, or following the date of this Agreement. The
          relationship between the Agent and the Lenders is that of agent and
          principal only, and the Agent shall not have by reason of this
          Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lenders.

11.2.     DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF AGENT

                 Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or
employees (and, for purposes hereof, the Agent shall be deemed to be contracting
as agent for and on behalf of such Persons) shall be liable to any Lender for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection
with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (whether before, on or
after the date of this Agreement) except for its or their own gross negligence
or wilful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Agent:

<Page>

                                     - 60 -

          (a)  may assume that there has been no assignment or transfer by any
               Lender of its rights hereunder unless and until all of the
               requirements of section 12.9 have been complied with;

          (b)  may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
               and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
               action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
               accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
               experts;

          (c)  shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or
               any of the other Loan Documents by acting upon any notice,
               consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be
               by facsimile or other means of electronic communication) believed
               by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or
               parties or by acting upon any representation or warranty of the
               Borrower made or deemed to be made hereunder or thereunder;

          (d)  may assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
               is continuing unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary;

          (e)  may rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
               expected to be within the knowledge of any Person upon a
               certificate signed by or on behalf of such Person;

          (f)  does not make any warranty or representation to any Lender nor
               shall it be responsible to any Lender for the accuracy or
               completeness of the data made available to any of the Lenders in
               connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, or for any
               statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
               oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement;

          (g)  shall not have any duty to ascertain or to enquire as to the
               performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
               conditions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
               on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property (including
               the books and records) of the Borrower or any of its Material
               Subsidiaries;

          (h)  shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
               action under this Agreement unless it shall first receive such
               advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems
               appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
               by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which
               may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
               such action; and

          (i)  shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
               legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
               value of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any
               instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or
               for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations
               hereunder.

11.3.     PROMPT NOTICE TO THE LENDERS

                 The Agent shall provide to the Lenders copies of all
information, notices and reports given to the Agent by the Borrower as soon as
practicable after receipt of the same, except information, notices and reports
(i) relating solely to the role of Agent hereunder, (ii) distributed directly by
the Borrower to the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) otherwise
considered by the Agent to be irrelevant or immaterial to the Lenders or to any
particular category or group thereof.

<Page>

                                     - 61 -

11.4.     AGENT'S AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH BORROWER

                 With respect to its own participation in the Credit Facility,
the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent. The
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of business with the Company or any Affiliate of any of them and any Person
which may do business with any of them, all as if the Agent were not the Agent
hereunder and without any duties to account therefor to the Lenders or to any
other Person.

11.5.     DEALINGS BY BORROWER WITH AGENT

                 Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the Borrower
shall deal with the Agent in lieu of the Lenders for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Borrower may rely, and shall be fully protected in so relying,
without any obligation to inquire into the correctness thereof, upon any action
taken, notice, direction, waiver, consent, determination, communication or
agreement by the Agent purporting to be on behalf of the Majority Lenders or the
Lenders hereunder, as the case may be, any of which shall, as regards the
Borrower, be deemed to be an action, notice, direction, waiver, consent,
determination, communication or agreement of the Majority Lenders or the
Lenders, as applicable.

11.6.     INDEPENDENT CREDIT DECISIONS

                 Each Lender acknowledges that it has itself been, and will
continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal of
and investigations into the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition,
affairs, status and nature of the Company. Accordingly, each Lender confirms
with the Agent that it has not relied, and will not hereafter rely, on the Agent
(i) to check or enquire on its behalf into the adequacy, accuracy or
completeness of any information provided by the Borrower or any other Person
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions herein
contemplated (whether or not such information has been or is hereafter
distributed to such Lender by the Agent), or (ii) to assess or keep under review
on its behalf the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs,
status or nature of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or
creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries which may come into the
possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents.
Each Lender acknowledges that a copy of this Agreement and each of the other
Loan Documents has been made available to it for review and each Lender
acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance of the same.

11.7.     INDEMNIFICATION

                 Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent
not reimbursed by the Borrower), in accordance with its Rateable Portion, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Agent at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following
repayment in full of all Obligations) in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted
by the Agent hereunder or thereunder or in respect hereof or thereof; provided
that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse the Agent

<Page>

                                     - 62 -

promptly upon demand for its Rateable Portion of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preservation of any rights of the Agent or the Lenders as against the Borrower
under, or the enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to the
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. The
indemnity in this section 11.7 shall survive the payment and satisfaction of all
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

11.8.     SUCCESSOR AGENT

                 The Agent may, as hereinafter provided, resign at any time by
giving 30 days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor agent (the "Successor Agent") which shall be one of the Lenders. If no
Successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a Successor Agent from among the Lenders acceptable to the Borrower
acting reasonably. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by
a Successor Agent, such Successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its further duties and
obligations as Agent under this Agreement. The retiring Agent shall cooperate
with the Successor Agent in the performance of its duties for a reasonable
period of time after such resignation. After any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article 11 shall continue to enure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent hereunder.

11.9.     ACTION BY AND CONSENT OF LENDERS; WAIVER AND AMENDMENTS

          11.9.1.   Subject to section 11.9.3, where the terms of this Agreement
          or any of the other Loan Documents refer to any action to be taken
          hereunder or thereunder by the Lenders or to any such action that
          requires the consent or other determination of the Lenders, the action
          taken by and the consent or other determination given or made by the
          Majority Lenders shall, except to the extent that this Agreement
          expressly provides to the contrary, constitute the action or consent
          or other determination of the Lenders herein or therein referred to,
          and the Agent may exercise its powers under section 11.1 based upon
          such action, consent or other determination.

          11.9.2.   Subject to section 11.9.3, this Agreement and any other Loan
          Document may be amended only if the Borrower and the Majority Lenders
          so agree in writing, any consent under this Agreement or any other
          Loan Document shall be given only by the Agent (at the direction of
          the Majority Lenders) in writing, and any Event of Default may be
          waived before or after it occurs only if the Agent (at the direction
          of the Majority Lenders) so agrees in writing. Any amendment, consent
          or waiver so made shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          11.9.3.   Any amendment or waiver which changes or relates to:

          (a)  the amount or term of the Loan available hereunder or any
               Lender's Commitment;

          (b)  the amount or dates of payment of principal, interest or fees;

          (c)  the notice period required for any Advance;

          (d)  the amount or dates of payment of any fees;

<Page>

                                     - 63 -

          (e)  the definition of "Majority Lenders"; or

          (f)  this section 11.9;

          shall require the agreement of all of the Lenders and also (in the
          case of an amendment) of the Borrower. An amendment or waiver which
          changes or relates to the rights and/or obligations of the Agent shall
          also require the agreement of the Agent thereto.

          11.9.4.   Any waiver and any consent by the Agent or any Lenders under
          any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be
          given subject to any conditions thought fit by the Person giving that
          waiver or consent. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in
          the instance and for the purpose for which it is given.

11.10.    FUNDING OF ADVANCES

          11.10.1.  Upon receipt of a Borrowing Notice, the Agent shall
          forthwith notify each Lender of the proposed Borrowing Date, Rollover
          Date or Conversion Date, as the case may be, the principal amount of
          the relevant Advance, Rollover or Conversion, as the case may be, such
          Lender's Rateable Portion of any Advance, the account of the Agent to
          be credited by such Lender (if applicable) and all other relevant
          particulars thereof (including, in the case of an issuance of a Letter
          of Credit, the expiry date thereof and the name of the beneficiary
          thereof).

          11.10.2.  Each Lender shall, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time)
          on the relevant Borrowing Date, credit the Agent's account specified
          in the Agent's notice given under this section 11.10 with such
          Lender's Rateable Portion of each Advance in immediately available
          funds. The Agent will, as soon as reasonably practicable after
          receiving such funds from the Lenders and upon fulfilment of all
          applicable conditions set forth in this Agreement, make the full
          amount of such funds available to the Borrower by crediting the
          Borrower's account maintained with the Agent at the Branch of Account
          (or causing such account to be credited).

          11.10.3.  Unless the Agent has been notified by a Lender by 10:00 a.m.
          (Chicago time) on the proposed Borrowing Date of any Loan requested by
          the Borrower that such Lender will not make available to the Agent its
          Rateable Portion of such Loan, the Agent may assume that such Lender
          has made such portion of the Loan available to the Agent on the
          Borrowing Date in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Agent
          may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower
          on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender
          shall not have so made its Rateable Portion of a Loan available to the
          Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
          Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loan and all reasonable costs and
          expenses incurred by the Agent in connection therewith together with
          interest thereon (at the rate payable hereunder by the Borrower in
          respect of such Loan) for each day from the date such amount is made
          available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the
          Agent, provided, however, that notwithstanding such obligation if such
          Lender fails to so pay, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any
          rights the Borrower may have against such Lender, repay such amount to
          the Agent forthwith after demand therefor by the Agent. The amount
          payable to the Agent pursuant hereto shall be as set forth in a
          certificate delivered by the Agent to such Lender and the Borrower
          (which certificate shall contain reasonable details of how the amount
          payable is calculated) and shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the amount
          owing. If such Lender makes the payment to the Agent required herein,
          the amount so paid (otherwise than in respect of interest and such
          costs, charges and expenses of the Agent) shall constitute such
          Lender's Rateable Portion of the Loan for purposes of this Agreement.
          If the Agent has been

<Page>

                                     - 64 -

          notified by a Lender that such Lender will not make available to the
          Agent its Rateable Portion of any Loan, the Agent shall have no
          obligation to make available such amount to the Borrower under any
          provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document.

          11.10.4.  The failure of any Lender to fund its Rateable Portion of a
          Loan shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
          hereunder to fund its Rateable Portion of the Loan on the relevant
          Borrowing Date and nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights
          and remedies that the Borrower, the Agent or any Lender may have
          against a defaulting Lender.

11.11.    REMITTANCE OF PAYMENTS

          11.11.1.  As soon as practicable after receipt of any notice of
          payment by the Borrower hereunder, the Agent shall give notice to each
          Lender of the amount of the payment to be made to it on such day and
          all other relevant particulars of such payment. Subject to section
          11.15, as soon as practicable after receipt of any repayment or
          prepayment of any Loans under the Credit Facility or any payment of
          interest or any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder, the
          Agent shall remit to each Lender its Rateable Portion of such payment
          or prepayment and its respective entitlement, if any, to any other
          amount payable by the Borrower hereunder.

          11.11.2.  If the Agent, on the assumption that it will receive on any
          particular date a payment of principal, interest or fees hereunder,
          remits any amount to the relevant Lender and the Borrower fails to
          make such payment, each such Lender agrees to repay to the Agent
          forthwith on demand the amount so received by it together with all
          reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection
          therewith (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) and interest
          thereon at the rate and calculated in the manner applicable to the
          Loan in respect of which such payment was made for each day from the
          date such amount is remitted to the relevant Lender. The amount
          payable to the Agent pursuant hereto shall be as set forth in a
          certificate delivered by the Agent to each such Lender, which
          certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
          manifest error.

11.12.    REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

                 Except as otherwise expressly contemplated in this Agreement, a
Lender (a "Remitting Bank") which obtains any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, by way of set-off or otherwise) on account of its portion of a Loan
which has not been repaid to the other Lender in accordance with their
respective Rateable Portions shall, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes any such Lender to, remit such payment or portion thereof to the
Agent for redistribution to the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Rateable Portions. In any such case, the Remitting Bank, upon such payment by it
to the Agent, shall be deemed for all purposes not to have received from the
Borrower that payment so remitted to the Agent, and the Lenders or Bank (the
"Receiving Bank") receiving such payment or portions thereof upon a
redistribution thereof by the Agent shall be deemed for the purposes hereof to
have received such payment or portion thereof (as the case may be) from the
Borrower. If all or part of any such payment made by such Remitting Bank shall
be recovered by the Borrower from such Remitting Bank, such amount so paid by
such Remitting Bank to the Agent shall forthwith be repaid by the Receiving Bank
to the Agent (for the benefit of the Remitting Bank).

11.13.    NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULT

                 Each Lender shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent
shall promptly notify each of the Lenders, of any event of which it has actual
notice which constitutes a Default or an Event of

<Page>

                                     - 65 -

Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have actual notice of the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received notice from any
of the Lenders or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing the
default and stating that the notice is a "Notice of Default".

11.14.    TAKING AND ENFORCEMENT OF REMEDIES

          11.14.1.  Each of the Lenders hereby acknowledges that, to the extent
          permitted by Applicable Law, the remedies provided hereunder and under
          the other Loan Documents to the Lenders are for the benefit of the
          Lenders collectively and acting together and not severally and further
          acknowledges that its rights hereunder and thereunder are to be
          exercised collectively by the Agent upon the instructions of the
          Majority Lenders. Accordingly, notwithstanding any of the provisions
          contained herein or therein, each of the Lenders hereby covenants and
          agrees that it shall not be entitled to take any action with respect
          to the Credit Facility, including, without limitation, any election of
          remedies in respect of an Event of Default hereunder, but that any
          such action shall be taken only by the Agent upon the instructions of
          the Majority Lenders as provided herein. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, in the absence of instructions from the Majority Lenders
          (or, to the extent section 11.9.3 is applicable, all of the Lenders)
          where the Agent has requested instructions and in its sole opinion the
          exigencies of the situation warrant such action, the Agent may without
          notice to or consent of the Lenders take such action on behalf of the
          Lenders as it deems appropriate or desirable in the interests of the
          Lenders. Each of the Lenders further covenants and agrees, that, upon
          any such instructions being given to the Agent by the Majority
          Lenders, it shall cooperate fully with the Agent to the extent
          requested by the Agent in any remedial action hereunder including,
          without limitation, the appointment of a receiver and manager to act
          for their collective benefit. Each Lender covenants and agrees to do
          all acts and things and to make, execute and deliver all agreements
          and other instruments, including, without limitation, any instruments
          necessary to effect any registrations, so as to fully carry out the
          intent and purposes of this section 11.14.1.

          11.14.2.  Each Lender hereby covenants and agrees that it has not
          heretofore sought, taken, accepted or received and shall not hereafter
          seek, take, accept or receive any security for any of the obligations
          and liabilities of the Borrower hereunder or under the other Loan
          Documents or under any other document, instrument, writing or
          agreement ancillary hereto or thereto other than such security as is
          provided hereunder or thereunder and shall not enter into any
          agreement with any of the parties hereto or thereto relating in any
          manner whatsoever to the Credit Facility, unless all of the Lenders
          shall at the same time obtain the benefit of any such security or
          agreement.

          11.14.3.  Each of the Lenders and the Borrower further covenants and
          agrees that all proceeds from the exercise of the rights and remedies
          provided hereunder and under the Loan Documents, to the extent
          permitted by Applicable Law, are held for the benefit of all of the
          Lenders and, after deduction therefrom of all costs of enforcement,
          shall be shared among the Lenders proportionately based upon the
          respective aggregate amounts of the Obligations which are outstanding
          to each of the Lenders at the relevant time or times of sharing. To
          the extent any Lender receives or is entitled to receive any amount
          hereunder in excess of the amount of the Obligations owed to it
          hereunder it shall hold such excess in trust on behalf of and for the
          benefit of the other Lenders entitled thereto.

          11.14.4.  Each of the Lenders agrees with each of the other Lenders
          that if it exercises any right of set-off in accordance with the
          provisions hereof (or otherwise pursuant to Applicable Law) in
          connection with any Obligations, it shall promptly so advise the Agent
          and each of the

<Page>

                                     - 66 -

          other Lenders and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
          Lenders shall share all such set-offs in accordance with the
          provisions of section 11.14.3 hereof, provided that none of the
          Lenders shall be liable hereunder to any of the other Lenders by
          reason of failure to exercise or validly exercise any right of set-off
          or by reason of any restriction upon any such sharing.

11.15.    ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT RATEABLE PORTIONS

                 All Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility shall be
maintained as between the Lenders according to their respective Rateable
Portions, except to the extent that the Agent deems any variations therefrom to
be immaterial and except that the L/C Lender shall solely be responsible for
making L/C Loans. The Agent shall determine all adjustments to amounts required
to be advanced by the Lenders or to amounts of payments to which the respective
Lenders are entitled to reflect as nearly as practicable the respective Rateable
Portions of the Lenders under the Credit Facilities.

11.16.    NO PARTNERSHIP

                 Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the
Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders a partnership,
association, joint venture or other collective entity.

                                   ARTICLE 12.
                                     GENERAL

12.1.     RELIANCE AND NON-MERGER

                 All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of
the Borrower made herein or in any other Loan Document or in any certificate or
other document signed by any of its directors or officers and delivered by or on
behalf of either of them pursuant hereto or thereto are material, shall be
deemed to have been relied upon by the Agent and each Lender notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by the Agent, the Lenders or Lender's
Counsel or any employee or other representative of any of them and shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents until
there are no Loans outstanding and the Lenders shall have no further obligation
to make Advances hereunder. For clarity, this section 12.1 shall in no way
affect the survival of those provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Document
which by their terms are stated to survive termination of this Agreement.

12.2.     CONFIDENTIALITY

                 Each of the Agent and each of the Lenders will maintain on a
confidential basis (except as otherwise permitted hereunder or as required by
Applicable Law) all information relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
provided to it hereunder by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that this Section 12.2 shall not apply to any information which (i) was
lawfully in the public domain at the time of communication to the Agent or such
Lender, (ii) lawfully enters the public domain through no fault of the Agent or
such Lender subsequent to the time of communication to the Agent or such Lender,
(iii) was lawfully in the possession of the Agent or such Lender free of any
obligation of confidence at the time of communication to the Agent or such
Lender, or (iv) was lawfully communicated to the Agent or such Lender free of
any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time of initial communication to
the Agent or such Lender.

12.3.     NO SET-OFF BY THE BORROWER

                 The amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in
full and shall not be subject to any deduction, withholding, set-off or
counterclaim by the Borrower for any reason whatsoever.

12.4.     EMPLOYMENT OF EXPERTS

                 The Agent may, at any time and from time to time, at its cost
if not a responsibility of the Borrower in Section 5.4, retain and employ legal
counsel, independent accountants and other experts in order to perform or assist
it in the performance of its rights and powers under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents and will advise the Borrower at any time that it elects to do so.

12.5.     RELIANCE BY THE LENDERS

                 The Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon any

such further acts, documents and things in connection with the Credit Facilities
and the Loan Documents as the Agent may reasonably require from time to time for
the purpose of giving effect to the Loan Documents all within a reasonable
period of time following the request of the Agent.

12.9.     ASSIGNMENT

          12.9.1.   This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall enure to
          the benefit of and be binding on the parties hereto and thereto, their
          respective successors and any assignee or transferee of some or all of
          the parties' rights or obligations under this Agreement and the other
          Loan Documents as permitted under this section 12.9.

          12.9.2.   The Borrower shall not assign or transfer all or any part of
          its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
          Loan Documents without the prior written consent of all of the
          Lenders, which consent may be arbitrarily withheld and any such
          assignment without consent shall be null and void.

          12.9.3.   Any Lender (a "Grantor") may grant participations in all or
          part of its rights and obligations in respect of the Credit Facility
          and the Loan Documents to any other Person (a "Participant"), at such
          times and upon such terms as it may deem fit, without any obligation
          to obtain any consent of the Borrower, provided in each case that:

<Page>

                                     - 69 -

          (a)  the Grantor shall remain fully liable for all of its obligations
               and responsibilities hereunder to the same extent as if such
               participation had not been granted; and

          (b)  the Grantor shall administer the participation of the Participant
               and neither the Participant nor the Borrower shall have any
               rights against or obligations to, or deal directly with, each
               other in respect of the participation of the Participant.

          12.9.4.   Any Lender (an "Assignor") may assign or transfer all or
          part of its rights in respect of the Credit Facility and the Loan
          Documents to, and may have its corresponding obligations in respect
          thereof assumed by any other Lender or any Affiliate of the Assignor
          or any Person (the "Assignee") at such times and upon such terms as it
          may deem fit, in each case, but only after obtaining the prior written
          consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably
          withheld or delayed and shall be provided as soon as practicable, and
          provided further that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if
          an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), provided in each
          case that:

          (a)  without the Borrower's further prior written consent, no such
               assignment shall be permitted that would cause the Borrower to be
               obligated to make any payments under section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7
               arising on and as at the date of, and as a result of, such
               assignment that it was not otherwise obligated to pay to the
               Assignor on such date or would not be obligated to pay on such
               date but for such assignment;

          (b)  the Assignor and the Assignee shall enter into an assignment and
               assumption agreement (the "Assignment Agreement") substantially
               in the form of Schedule 12.9.4, or otherwise in form and
               substance satisfactory to the Agent and the Assignor, whereby
               INTER ALIA the Assignee agrees to be bound by this Agreement and
               all Loan Documents relating to the obligations of the Lenders in
               the place and stead of the Assignor to the extent that the rights
               and obligations of the Assignor shall have been assigned to and
               assumed by the Assignee, and shall deliver a copy of the
               Assignment Agreement so executed to the Agent;

          (c)  the Assignor shall pay to the Agent for the Agent's own account
               an administrative fee of $3,500 concurrently with the delivery of
               the Assignment Agreement to Agent;

          (d)  the Agent shall execute the Assignment Agreement and shall notify
               the Borrower of the proposed Assignee and the rights and
               obligations to be assigned or transferred to the Assignee.
               Subject to the required consent (if any) of the Borrower to the
               assignment or transfer, the Agent and the Borrower shall execute
               and deliver the Assignment Agreement, and the Agent shall then
               deliver a copy of the executed Assignment Agreement to the
               Assignee and the Assignor. The Borrower shall execute and deliver
               such other assurances as may be reasonably requested by the Agent
               to confirm the release and discharge provided for in clause (e)
               below;

          (e)  upon execution of the Assignment Agreement by the Assignor, the
               Assignee, the Agent and (if the consent of the Borrower is
               required) the Borrower, the assignment or transfer to the
               Assignee shall be effective upon the date provided in the
               Assignment Agreement, and the Assignee shall thereafter be and be
               treated as a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement and the
               other Loan Documents and shall be entitled to the full benefit
               hereof and thereof to the extent of such benefits as are
               transferred to it by the Assignor and subject to the obligations
               of the Assignor to the same extent as if the Assignee were an
               original party in respect of the rights and obligations
               transferred to and assumed by it, and the Assignor in

<Page>

                                     - 70 -

               respect of such assignment shall be released and discharged
               accordingly other than in respect of claims of the Borrower or a
               Guarantor against the Assignor relating to an event or
               circumstances arising, existing or occurring prior to such
               assignment;

          (f)  as soon as practicable after the assignment or transfer shall
               have become effective the Agent shall prepare and distribute to
               the Lenders and to the Borrower an amendment to Schedule 1.1.61
               reflecting the adjustments to the Lender's Commitments after such
               transfer or assignment, to which amendment the Borrower hereby
               agrees; and

          (g)  the Assignee (other than an Assignee that is an Affiliate of the
               Assignor) of any Loan outstanding hereunder shall be entitled to
               receive the principal monies and all interest and all other
               monies owing under this Agreement in respect thereof free from
               all equities or rights of set-off or counterclaim between the
               Borrower and the original Lender or Lender that advanced such
               Loan and any intermediate Person entitled thereto and all Persons
               may act accordingly.

          12.9.5.   the Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby consent to each
          and every assignment or transfer which may be made on or after the
          date hereof in accordance with the terms of section 12.9.4 and to the
          release and discharge of every Assignor provided for in clause (e)
          thereof; and

          12.9.6.   any assignment, transfer or grant by a Lender as
          contemplated by this section 12.9 will not constitute a repayment by
          the Borrower to the Grantor or Assignor, as the case may be, of the
          assigned or participated portion of the Credit Facility, nor an
          Advance to the Borrower by the Assignee or Participant, as the case
          may be, and the parties acknowledge that the Borrower's obligations
          hereunder with respect to the assigned, transferred or participated
          portion of Loans will continue and not constitute new obligations.

12.10.    EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

                 Each Lender may provide to any proposed assignee or participant
such information concerning the financial position and the operations of the
Company as, in the opinion of such Lender, may be relevant or useful in
connection with the Credit Facility or any portion thereof proposed to be
acquired by such assignee or participant, provided that each recipient of such
information agrees not to disclose such information to any other Person and to
be bound by the terms of section 12.2.

12.11.    COUNTERPARTS

                 This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such separate
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

12.12.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT

parties hereto pertaining to the matters therein set forth and supersede and

Facility. There are no warranties, representations or agreements between the
parties in connection with such matters except as specifically set forth or
