Neither party is obligated to proceed with any Service changes unless and until such change is reflected in a Change Request that is mutually executed by the parties. The parties shall bear their own expenses associated with the negotiation of any

any employment related taxes. If Client pays any tax to Vendor and the tax is later determined not to be due or is subject to a refund, Vendor shall immediately refund the amount thereof to Client. If Client disputes and refuses to pay any tax,
Client agrees to indemnify and hold Vendor harmless if such tax is later determined to be due and payable by Client. Vendor agrees that Client is not responsible hereunder for paying, collecting or withholding any federal, state or local employment

information security, and other federal and state laws regarding the privacy and confidentiality of customer records. Consistent with the provisions of GLBA and such other laws and regulations, Vendor shall implement appropriate measures designed to
ensure the security and confidentiality of the Nonpublic Personal Information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or of such information, and protect against unauthorized access or use of such information. Vendor
shall provide to Bank copies of all audits and summaries of test results performed periodically by Vendor or Vendor&#146;s external auditors relating to Vendor&#146;s information security measures. From time to time, Bank, its auditors, its
regulators and/or third party auditor(s) designated by Bank may conduct examinations and audits of Vendor, its Representatives (as defined below), and the system and facilities used to provide Vendor&#146;s services. Vendor shall cooperate with all
such audits. Bank shall give Vendor, as permitted, reasonable advance notice of all audits and shall perform all audits at reasonable times. Vendor acknowledges that GLBA, among other things, limits the right of recipients to use and redisclose the
Nonpublic Personal Information, and Vendor agrees that its use of the Nonpublic Personal Information will be consistent with the limits imposed by GLBA and other applicable laws and regulations.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;
