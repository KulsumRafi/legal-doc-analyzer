maturity of such indebtedness is accelerated; or

          (c)  the Maker shall generally fail to pay, or admit in writing its
inability to pay, its debts as they become due, or shall voluntarily commence
any proceeding or file any petition under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar

receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator for a substantial portion of its
property, assets or business, or shall by any act or failure to act indicate its
consent to or approval of any of the foregoing, or if any corporate action is
taken by the Maker for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; or

          (d)  involuntary proceedings or an involuntary petition shall be
commenced or filed against the Maker under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar

shall be issued or levied against a substantial part of its property, assets or
business, and such writ, judgment, lien, warrant of attachment, execution or

after commencement, filing or levy, as the case may be, or any order for relief
shall be entered in any such proceeding; or any winding-up, dissolution,
liquidation or reorganization of the Maker; then, and in every such event, and
at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, (i) in the case of
an Event of Default under clauses (a) and (b), the Holders of a majority of the
outstanding principal amount of all Notes may declare all principal and accrued
interest and all other fees and other obligations of the Maker under the Notes
to be due and payable, and (ii) in the case of an Event of Default under clauses
(c) or (d), all principal and accrued interest on all outstanding Notes and all
fees and other obligations of the Maker due under the Notes will be immediately
due and payable without any further declaration or other act on the part of the
Holders, in either case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Maker.

     4.   Series of Notes; Actions by Majority. This Note is one of a series of
Notes of like tenor issued in an original aggregate principal amount of up to
$12,000,000. When actions are specified herein as happening upon the decision of

or otherwise, in whole or in part, by the Maker without the prior written
consent of the Holder except in connection with an assignment in whole to a
successor Maker to the Maker in a merger of the Maker or a sale of all or
substantially all of the Maker's property and assets and then only if the

     8.   Remedies Cumulative. Each and every right, power and remedy herein
given to the Holder, or otherwise existing, shall be cumulative and not
exclusive and be in addition to all other rights, powers and remedies now or
hereafter granted (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off under
applicable law) or otherwise existing. Each and every right, power and remedy
whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from
time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the

instrument in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph), delay,
indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy
hereunder or to have acquiesced in any default or Event of Default or in any
breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor
any delay in exercising, on the part of the Holder, any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
A waiver by the Holder of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion
shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Holder would
otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided
are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by law.

ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, THE JURISDICTION OF
THE AFORESAID COURTS. THE MAKER HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
CLAIM OR DEFENSE IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED ON ANY ALLEGED LACK OF
PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR
BASIS. THE MAKER FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY COMPLAINT,
SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER PROCESS RELATING TO ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY

event exceed the maximum rate permissible under applicable law. If the rate of
interest payable on this Note is ever reduced as a result of this paragraph and
at any time thereafter the maximum rate permitted under applicable law exceeds
the rate of interest provided for in this Note, then the rate provided for in
this Note shall be increased to the maximum rate provided for under applicable
law for such period as is required so that the total amount of interest received

operation of the first sentence of this paragraph.
