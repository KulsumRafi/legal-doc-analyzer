     1.   DEFINITIONS

          As used in  this Agreement, the  following  terms have  the respective
following meanings.  These meanings apply eqully to the singular and plural form
of the defined terms:

          1.1.  Agreement  or   this  Agreement    means  this   Vehicle  Supply
Agreement as originally executed and as such may be amended from time to time.

          1.2.  Available Volume means the number of  Vehicles,  both GDP Volume
and Other Volume, that Chrysler makes available to DTAG pursuant to Section 2.1.

          1.3.  GDP Program  means (a) any  program made  generally available by
Chrysler to daily car rental  companies  for the  purchase  of Vehicles  through
Chrysler's  authorized  dealers  that  provides,  subject to  certain  terms and
conditions,  for Chrysler's  guarantee of the  depreciated  value upon resale of
Vehicles sold under the program,  or (b) to the extent that  Chrysler  ceases to
offer such a program that provides for Chrysler's  guarantee of the  depreciated
value upon  resale of  Vehicles  sold under the  program,  a program  offered by
Chrysler in  substitution  for the program that Chrysler has ceased to offer and

          1.4.  GDP Volume means an annual volume of Vehicles  made available by

to daily car rental  companies.  Each of these  periods will be as determined by

period ends.

          1.7.  Other  Vehicle Programs means  rental vehicle  purchase or lease
programs offered to DTAG by entities other than  DaimlerChrysler  Motors Company
and its affiliated companies.  However,  Other Vehicle Programs include programs

          1.8.  Other Volume means an annual volume of Vehicles  made  available

2.   SUPPLY OF GDP AND OTHER VOLUME VEHICLES

          2.1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  in each
     Model Year of this  Agreement  Chrysler will make available for purchase by
     DTAG  through  Chrysler's  authorized  dealers  125,000  Vehicles  of which
     100,000 Vehicles will be GDP Volume (80%) and 25,000 Vehicles will be Other
     Volume (20%), in a mix generally  suitable for the vehicle rental business.
     DTAG may assign the right to purchase a portion of the  Vehicles to be made
     available by Chrysler pursuant to this Section to any franchisee of DTAG by
     advising Chrysler of that assignment in writing.

          2.2.  Chrysler will endeavor to provide an  additional volume of 5,000
Vehicles  during  the term of this  Agreement  specifically  to the  franchisees
listed below.

                                       XXX

          2.3.  In each model year DTAG must acquire a Minimum Volume of 100,000
Vehicles of which at least 20% must be Other Volume.

          2.4.  At least 75% of the vehicles acquired by DTAG in any Model Year,
irrespective of whether obtained by purchase, lease or otherwise, (collectively,
"purchased")  must be  Vehicles,  until and unless DTAG  obtains  the  Available
Volume as set forth in Section 2.1.

          2.5.  In any Model Year in which DTAG purchases the Available  Volume,
and that  Available  Volume  does not  constitute  at least 75% of DTAG's  total
vehicle  fleet  acquisitions,  DTAG agrees to notify  Chrysler of Other  Vehicle
Programs being  considered  from time to time and, to the extent Chrysler offers
additional  vehicles to generally  match or exceed  these  programs in net cost,
mix, terms and volume,  DTAG will be obligated to accept  Chrysler's  offer.  If
Chrysler  declines  to make such a  matching  offer,  DTAG may  adjust its total
vehicle  acquisitions  for each model year included in the Other Vehicle Program
agreement by the number of vehicles  included in that  agreement for the purpose
of calculating  its obligation  under this section,  provided such an adjustment
does not result in DTAG purchasing less than the Minimum Volume.

          2.6.  Chrysler will  make a GDP Program available  to DTAG  while this
Agreement is in effect. The terms and conditions of any GDP Program,  taken as a
whole,  will be  competitive  with the  terms  and  conditions  of a  guaranteed
residual  value or  repurchase  program then being made  generally  available by
either Ford Motor Company ("Ford") or General Motors  Corporation ("GM") to bona
fide daily rental  businesses in the United States,  or, if Ford or GM, cease to
offer such a guaranteed  residual value or repurchase program, a program offered
by Ford or GM, as the case may be, in  substitution  for the program that it has
ceased to offer. Chrysler retains the right to make, in its sole discretion, all
decisions  regarding  any GDP Program or other  Chrysler  fleet  sales  program,
including without limitation decisions regarding the terms and conditions of any
GDP Programs and any restrictions on the Vehicles or mix of Vehicles that may or
must be ordered.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  Chrysler
expressly  retains  the  right  to  make  fleet  sales  programs   available  to
franchisees  of  DTAG.  Notwithstanding  the  terms  and  conditions  of any GDP
Program,  DTAG may use  Vehicles  made  available by Chrysler to DTAG under this
Agreement in the State of Hawaii.

     3.      ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

          3.1.  DTAG must advertise, promote, and give exposure to the qualities
and  features  of  Vehicles  in  advertising  or  other  promotional   materials
(including without limitation  magazine,  newspaper,  direct mail, Yellow Pages,
radio,  and  television  advertising,  as well as point of rental  items such as
leaflets,  folders,  brochures,  counter  displays,  and  exhibits)  designed to
promote the rental of Vehicles.  These advertising and promotional activities by
DTAG must all be in accordance with the  advertising and promotional  guidelines
communicated by Chrysler to DTAG.

          3.2.  DTAG  may  not  advertise,   use  or  permit  the  use   in  any
advertisement or promotional material relating to the rental of vehicles, either
the content of which is  controlled  directly or  indirectly by DTAG, or that is
placed or caused to be placed by DTAG,  in either case that  contains any of the
following:

     (a)  Any pictorial reproduction of a vehicle other than a Vehicle:

     (b)  Any reference to any vehicle manufacturer other than DaimlerChrysler;


     (c)  Any reference to any trade name of any line,  make or model of vehicle
          other than the lines, makes and models of Vehicles: and.

     (d)  Any use of Dollar/Thrifty's  name, logos,  trademarks or service marks
          as an  endorsement  of or  testimonial  to any  vehicle  other  than a
          Vehicle, or to any vehicle manufacturer other than Chrysler.

          3.3.  DTAG,  its  agents  and  employees  may  not  make  any   public
statement,  (including  without  limitation in any  advertising  or  promotional
material  relating  to the rental of  vehicles,  either the  content of which is
controlled  directly or  indirectly  by DTAG,  or that is placed or caused to be
placed by DTAG) that is disparaging  or derogatory of, or otherwise  detrimental
to, (a)  Chrysler,  (b) any line,  make or model of Vehicle,  or (c) any product
sold,  leased or manufactured by or for  DaimlerChrysler.  This Section survives
any  termination  of this  Agreement for a reasonable  time, but in no event for
less than one year after that termination.

          3.4.  Notwithstanding sections  3.2  and 3.3, during the term  of this
Agreement,  DTAG may enter into an advertising  and promotion  supply  agreement
with another motor vehicle  manufacturer  or  distributor  for the Thrifty daily
rental entity only.  DTAG will give prompt written notice of its entry into such
agreement and,  thereafter,  this Agreement shall be deemed to apply only to the
Dollar daily rental  entity and all other terms and  provisions  will remain the
same.

     4.      PAYMENTS

          4.1.  So long as no event of default (as described in sections 5.2) by
DTAG has occurred or is  continuing  and DTAG has  achieved the Minimum  Volume,
while this  Agreement is in effect  Chrysler will pay DTAG the  following  Fixed
Annual Amount.

          2003 Model Year                    $XXX
          2004 Model Year                    $XXX
          2005 Model Year                    $XXX
          2006 Model Year                    $XXX
          2007 Model Year                    $XXX

Payments  will be to DTAG on a quarterly  schedule on the first  business day of
each July, October,  January and April. For example,  during the 2004 Model Year
Chrysler  will pay DTAG $XXX on the first  business  day of July  2003,  October
2003, January 2004 and April 2004. If this Agreement  terminates earlier than at
the end of a Model Year, DTAG must immediately refund to Chrysler one-twelfth of
the annual  payment for each whole month  remaining in the quarter in which this
Agreement terminates. For example, for the quarter beginning on July 1, 2004, if
this Agreement  terminated the subsequent  August 13, DTAG would be obligated to
immediately  refund to  Chrysler  XXX  dollars  ($XXX)  (i.e.,  one whole  month
remaining (August 13 to October 1) times $XXX).

          4.2.  Failure to achieve the Minimum Volume in accordance with section
2.3 in any Model  Year will  result in  forfeiture  by DTAG of the Fixed  Annual
Amount  otherwise  payable for that model  year.  Failure to achieve the Minimum
Volume  does not  relieve  either  party from its other  obligations  under this
Agreement,  providing DTAG  purchases  Vehicles in such numbers as to constitute
75% of its vehicle fleet acquisitions.

          4.3.  For each Vehicle  purchased by DTAG or purchased by a franchisee
as an assignment of DTAGs  allocation  under this  Agreement  through a Chrysler
fleet sales program  pursuant to the GDP Volume and Other Volume,  Chrysler will
pay XXX  Dollars  ($XXX)  to DTAG on a net 30th  proximo  basis  against  a DTAG
invoice therefor.

     5.   TERM AND TERMINATION

          5.1.  This  Agreement will be effective from the beginning of the 2003
Model Year.  This  Agreement  will  terminate  at the end of the 2007 Model Year
unless  earlier  terminated as set forth below.  At the conclusion of each model
year  Chrysler  and DTAG  representatives  will meet and discuss  amending  this
Agreement by extending it an additional Model Year.  Neither party is obliged to
agree to all or any part of such a proposal,  and this Agreement may be extended
only by mutual agreement.

          5.2.  If a  party (the "Defaulting  Party") (a) defaults in any of its
obligations hereunder,  and fails to remedy such default within thirty (30) days
after such default has been called to its  attention by written  notice from the
other  party,  (b) files a petition  in  bankruptcy,  has an order  entered on a
petition in  bankruptcy  filed  against it, makes a general  assignment  for the
benefit of creditors, or otherwise acknowledges its insolvency,  (c) is adjudged
bankrupt, (d) commences or is placed in complete liquidation, or (e) suffers the
appointment of a receiver for any substantial portion of its business who is not
discharged  within ninety days after  appointment,  then, and in any such event,
the other party at its option may  terminate  this  Agreement  immediately  upon
written notice to the Defaulting Party.

          5.3.  Until DTAG achieves the  Available Volume,  75% of  DTAG's fleet
acquisitions  must be  Vehicles  or  Chrysler  may  immediately  terminate  this
Agreement.

     6.   CONFIDENTIALITY

          The terms and conditions of this  Agreement are confidential  and must
be treated as confidential by both parties except as otherwise  provided herein.
The parties must maintain the  confidentiality  of such  information by limiting
its use to fulfilling their respective  obligations  under this Agreement and by
not  otherwise  disclosing  such  confidential  information  to any third party,
except that the parties may disclose the terms and  conditions of this Agreement
(a) as necessary to their  respective  financial  and legal  advisors as long as
those   advisors   are  under  a   professional   obligation   to  maintain  the
confidentiality of those terms and conditions,  and (b) to the extent that those
terms and  conditions  must be furnished to a governmental  authority  (federal,
state, or local),  including,  without limitation, an administrative or judicial
body, as long as the party that must furnish the terms and conditions  takes all
reasonable steps to prevent the subsequent  disclosure of any of those terms and
conditions by the  governmental  authority  through a protective  order or other
similar action.

     7.   WARRANTY AND REPRESENTATION

          DTAG  warrants and  represents  to Chrysler,  upon  which warranty and
representation  Chrysler  has  relied in the  execution  hereof,  that DTAG will
purchase or assign for purchase by the listed franchisees,  Vehicles pursuant to
this Agreement  only for purposes of DTAG,  its affiliates or franchisees  using
those Vehicles in a bona fide daily rental  business,  and, in any case, not for
resale of those Vehicles as new motor vehicles.

     8.   SEVERABILITY

          Whenever possible, each part  of this Agreement must be interpreted as
being in accordance with and enforceable  under  applicable law. If part of this
Agreement is unlawful or  unenforceable  under applicable law, it is unlawful or
unenforceable  only to the extent  required by applicable law, and the remainder
of this Agreement is otherwise fully effective and enforceable. Without limiting
the foregoing,  if it is unlawful to perform any of the acts  contemplated to be
performed  hereunder,  irrespective of whether that unlawfulness  results from a
change in law, a temporary loss of rights by any party, or otherwise,  then this
Agreement  continues  to be effective  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law,
except that the parties are not  obligated to perform an unlawful act while that
act remains unlawful.

     9.   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

          DTAG  acknowledges  that Chrysler  will suffer  irreparable harm  as a
result of any breach of Sections 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 or Article 6 of this Agreement
by DTAG.  DTAG also  acknowledges  that in the event of a breach of any of those
Sections  by DTAG,  Chrysler  may  apply  for and will be  entitled  to  receive
injunctive relief from any court of competent  jurisdiction  enjoining DTAG from
any further  breach of its  obligations  under those Sections  without  Chrysler
having to offer specific proof that Chrysler has suffered irreparable harm.

     10.  ADHERENCE BY FRANCHISEES

          Chrysler   acknowledges  that  DTAG's   franchisees  are   independent
businesses  that are not parties to this  Agreement.  DTAG must,  to the maximum
extent  possible  consistent with DTAG's  preexisting  agreements and applicable
law,  obtain the  adherence of DTAG's  franchisees  to the terms of Article 3 of
this Agreement.

     11.  INDEMNIFICATION

          11.1. DTAG must defend, indemnify and hold Chrysler  harmless from and
against any and all  claims,  losses,  damages,  costs and  expenses  (including
without limitation attorneys' fees) resulting from, arising out of, or connected
in any way with (a) any advertising or promotional materials designed to promote
the rental or leasing of  Vehicles  by DTAG or any of its  franchisees,  (b) any
promotional or publicity  items relating to Chrysler or the rental or leasing of
Vehicles by DTAG or any of its franchisees, (c) any franchisee incentive program
or payment  implemented  or promised  by DTAG,  and (d) any  assignment,  or any
failure  to  assign  by  DTAG to a DTAG  franchisee  under  Section  2.1 of this
Agreement  (a  "Claim").  DTAG is not  required to  indemnify  Chrysler  for any
amounts  paid by Chrysler in  settlement  of a Claim if Chrysler  agreed to that
settlement without first obtaining DTAG's written consent to that settlement.

          11.2. If  Chrysler receives notice of the  commencement  or threatened
commencement  of an  action  or  proceeding  involving  a Claim.  Chrysler  will
promptly  notify  DTAG of that Claim.  A failure by Chrysler to promptly  notify
DTAG does not relieve DTAG of its obligations under this Agreement except to the
extent that DTAG can  demonstrate  that that failure  damaged DTAG. DTAG will be
entitled  to have  control  of the  defense or  settlement  of any Claim if DTAG
notifies Chrysler in writing within fifteen days of DTAG's receipt of Chrysler's

notice that DTAG  elects to take  control of the Claim.  In that event  Chrysler
will be  entitled  to  participate  in the  defense  of the Claim and may employ
separate counsel at Chrysler's  expense,  and DTAG must obtain  Chrysler's prior
written consent to any settlement that would cause injunctive or other equitable
relief to be imposed on  Chrysler.  After any notice by DTAG that DTAG is taking
control of a Claim,  DTAG will not be liable for any legal expenses  incurred by
Chrysler in defense of that Claim.  If DTAG does not timely notify Chrysler that
DTAG elects to take control of a Claim,  then  Chrysler may defend that Claim in
such  manner as  Chrysler  deems  appropriate,  and DTAG will bear all costs and
expenses of Chrysler's defense.  DTAG will promptly reimburse Chrysler for those
costs and  expenses as they are  incurred.  Notwithstanding  DTAG's  election to
control the defense of a Claim,  Chrysler will have the right to engage separate
legal counsel and DTAG will bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
counsel if defenses may be available to Chrysler that are  different  from those
available to DTAG such that an actual or potential  conflict of interest  exists
between DTAG and Chrysler.

     12.  USE OF TRADEMARKS. TRADE NAMES OR SERVICE MARKS

          Any use of either party's trademarks,  trade  names or  service marks,
including  the manner and  quality in which  those  trademarks,  trade  names or
service marks is reproduced or displayed,  is under the control and  supervision
of the party owning that trademark, trade name or service mark and is subject to
prior written approval by an authorized  representative  of the party owning the
trademark, trade name or service mark.

     13.  SURVIVAL

          The termination  of this  Agreement does not release either party from
any  outstanding  obligations  accruing  prior  to such  termination,  including
without  limitation the payment of monies. The following terms of this Agreement
survive  termination:  Section 3.3, Article 6, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10,
Article 11,  Article 12, and  Article  14.  Each of these terms  survives  for a
period of five years after termination  unless a different period of survival is
set forth for a term.

     14.  AUDIT

          DTAG must  maintain,  and  Chrysler  has the right to audit or verify,
all  accounts,  books,  records  and  other  documents  with  respect  to DTAG's
performance of its obligations  under this  Agreement.  This right will continue

     15.  NO WAIVER

          Failure by either party to enforce  at any time any of the  provisions
of this  Agreement  or any  rights  that may arise as a result of breach of this
Agreement  by another  party  should not be  construed as a waiver of any of its
rights, does not affect the validity of this Agreement or any part thereof,  and
does not prejudice any party as regards any subsequent action, provided however,
that a party may  expressly  waive any of its rights under this  Agreement by an
appropriate  writing that specifically  refers to the contractual right which is
being expressly waived.

     16.  FORCE MAJEURE

          To the extent that a party is not able to perform an obligation  under
this Agreement due to fire,  flood, a strike or other labor  interruption,  war,
riot, an act of God, an act of government,  insurrection,  civil disturbance, or
other cause beyond that party's reasonable control, that party may not be liable
for failing to perform that obligation,  except that this Article may not excuse
any  party  from  the  obligation  to pay  money  that is  owed.  If  Chrysler's
obligation to make Vehicles available as set forth in Section 2.1 is excused for
one of these causes,  then DTAG's obligations under Sections 2.3 and 2.4 will be
excused to the extent that Chrysler's  obligation to make Vehicles  available is
excused.
