RE:      RETENTION PROGRAM AMENDMENT

Dear Gerardo:

         Reference is made to the letter dated January 11, 2002 describing your
Retention Program approved by our board of directors (the "LETTER"). As we have
discussed, both you and the Company agree that it would be in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders to amend the Letter to delay the second
payment under the Program as set forth below. All capitalized terms used herein
without definition shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Letter.

         Under the Letter, your retention payment schedule provides for payments
of $50,000 on each of the following dates, subject to your continued Service
with the Company on that date:

                                 July 1, 2002
                                 January 1, 2003
                                 July 1, 2003

         Your first retention payment of $50,000 was made by the Company on July
1, 2002. The Letter is hereby amended to provide that your second payment of
$50,000 will be made on July 1, 2003 together with the third payment, also
scheduled for that date, subject to the same conditions as set forth in the
Letter.

         Except as otherwise modified herein, all terms of the Letter shall
remain in full force and effect. This agreement may only be amended, modified or
terminated by an agreement in writing signed by you and the Company. This
agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

         This agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
California without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

Very truly yours,

DIGITAL IMPACT, INC.
