unconditionally and irrevocably, and jointly and severally, as primary obligor
and not merely as surety, guarantees the full and prompt payment when due,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of all
obligations (monetary or otherwise) of the Guaranteed Obligors to each of the
Lenders, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and each Qualified Hedge
Counterparty, howsoever created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to
become due, which arise out of or in connection with the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application, any
Hedging Agreement or any other Loan Document, in each case as the same may be
amended, modified, extended or renewed from time to time (all such obligations
being herein collectively called the &#147;Guaranteed
Obligations&#148;); <I>provided </I>always
that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor (other than Hollinger UK
Holdings Limited (&#147;HUKH&#148;) ) shall not extend to nor include the obligations
hereunder of HUKH in respect of Publishing or Hollinger International as
Guaranteed Obligors, and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent
or any other Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any
other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Guarantor&#146;s liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any Guaranteed Obligor to any
Secured Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that
they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Guaranteed Obligor.

each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for
purposes of Bankruptcy Law (as hereinafter defined), the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign,
federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties and the
Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor
under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will
result in the Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty not
constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. For purposes hereof,
&#147;Bankruptcy Law&#148; means any proceeding of the type referred to in Section&nbsp;12.1.4
of the Credit Agreement or Title 11, U.S. Code or any similar foreign, federal
or state law for the relief of debtors.

Document under which they arise, regardless of any law, regulation or order now
