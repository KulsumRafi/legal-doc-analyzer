receipt by such Affected Seller of the Forfeiture Notice, to deliver notice to Buyer (the "Dispute Notice") disputing the facts asserted by Company in its Forfeiture Notice; if any Affected Seller
delivers a Dispute Notice, all Affected Sellers shall be deemed to have delivered a Dispute Notice. Failure by all Affected Sellers receiving the Forfeiture Notice to provide a Dispute Notice to Buyer

required, notwithstanding the termination of the employment or the Consulting Agreement, as the case may
be, of the relevant Seller, to continue to make the payments of the Contingent Cash Purchase Price, then Buyer shall, within three (3)&nbsp;calendar days of such determination, pay to each Affected
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts such Affected Seller(s) shall specify to Buyer in writing the full amount of any and all payments of the Contingent
Cash Purchase Price that were scheduled to be paid to such Affected Seller(s) pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Schedule&nbsp;2.3.2</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> during the period in which the dispute

the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be the sole expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that
joint representation is inappropriate based on an actual or likely conflict of interest, the fees and expenses of any separate counsel employed by the Indemnified Party will be the expense of the
