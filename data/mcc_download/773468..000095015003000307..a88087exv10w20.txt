         Consultant shall hold and maintain Confidential Information in the
         strictest confidence and in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of
         IndyMac. Consultant shall not use Confidential Information for his/her
         own benefit, publish or otherwise disclose Confidential Information to
         others, or permit use of Confidential Information by others for their
         benefit or to the detriment of IndyMac. Either upon demand of IndyMac
         or upon the termination of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately
         return to IndyMac all Confidential Information in his/her possession,
         as well as any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or
         tangible materials pertaining thereto.

4.2      OWNERSHIP OF INVENTIONS. All ideas, inventions, improvements and
         materials created or conceived by Consultant, solely or jointly with

         equipment, facilities, supplies, or other resources of IndyMac
         ("Inventions"), are and shall be the sole and exclusive property of
         IndyMac. Consultant hereby assigns to IndyMac all right, title and
         interest he/she may have in and to such Inventions and any patents,
         copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights based thereon.
         Consultant irrevocably designates and appoints IndyMac, and each of its
         duly authorized officers and agents, as his/her agent and
         attorney-in-fact to execute and to file any document

                                       3
<PAGE>
         and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution,
         issuance and enforcement of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other
         proprietary rights with the same force and effect as if executed and
         delivered by Consultant. In connection with the foregoing, Consultant
         shall execute the Confidential Information and Ownership of Inventions
         Agreement attached as Exhibit C hereto.

4.3      COMPUTER SYSTEMS ACCESS. If Consultant has been or is required to
         access IndyMac's computer systems in order to perform Services
         hereunder, Consultant agrees that he/she has and will (i) use only the
         log-in identification assigned by IndyMac, (ii) correctly and
         completely log-off the system immediately upon completion of each
         session of Service, (iii) not allow any other person to use the

         enabling such access strictly confidential, (v) not access any IndyMac
         systems or data other than that which is specifically authorized, and
         (vi) not intentionally spread viruses or other malicious computer code
         to IndyMac's computer systems.

4.4      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. Consultant warrants and
         represents that he/she has not and shall not infringe upon or violate
         the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any third
         party in its performance of services hereunder.

4.5      RELIEF IN CASE OF BREACH. Consultant understands and acknowledges that
         any use, disclosure or misappropriation of Confidential Information or
         Inventions in violation of this Agreement will cause IndyMac
         irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain.
         Consultant agrees that IndyMac shall have the right to an order
         restraining any actual or threatened use, disclosure or
         misappropriation of Confidential Information and/or Inventions and to
         apply for such other relief as IndyMac shall deem appropriate. Such
         right of IndyMac is to be in addition to all of the remedies otherwise
         available to it at law or in equity.

5.       INDEMNITY. Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend IndyMac
         against any and all losses, damages, claims, or expenses incurred or
         suffered, either directly or indirectly, by IndyMac or its directors,
         employees or agents, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
         arising out of or relating to (i) any act or omission on the part of
         Consultant; (ii) Consultant's breach of any provision of this
         Agreement, (iii) Consultant's use, disclosure or misappropriation of
         any Confidential Information or Invention, or (iv) a determination by
         any court, tribunal or agency that an employment relationship has or
         will be established by the performance of this Agreement.

         CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND OWNERSHIP OF INVENTIONS AGREEMENT

         CAUTION: THIS AGREEMENT CREATES IMPORTANT OBLIGATIONS OF TRUST AND
AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS WHICH YOU MAY CREATE WHILE PERFORMING
CONSULTING SERVICES FOR INDYMAC.

         I, Thomas J. Kearns, acknowledge that IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. and its
affiliates (together collectively referred to as "IndyMac") operate in a
competitive environment and that IndyMac enhances its opportunities to succeed
by establishing certain policies, including those included in this Confidential
Information and Ownership of Inventions Agreement ("Agreement"). I will be
performing consulting services for IndyMac either as a consultant or as an
employee of an entity retained as a consultant (herein referred to as "my
employer"). This Agreement is designed to make clear that while performing
consulting services for IndyMac and thereafter, (i) I will maintain the
confidentiality of the IndyMac's Confidential Information, as defined in Section
1(b) below; (ii) I will use IndyMac's Confidential Information for the exclusive
benefit of IndyMac; (iii) Inventions, as defined in Section 2(a) below, that I
create will be owned by IndyMac; (iv) my prior and continuing activities
separate from IndyMac will not conflict with IndyMac's development of its
Confidential Information; and (v) when my work for IndyMac as a consultant
terminates, I will not use my prior position with IndyMac to the detriment of
IndyMac. For the payment of good and valuable consideration, I agree to the
following:

                  1.       DUTY NOT TO USE OR DISCLOSE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                  (a)      I acknowledge that IndyMac possesses and will
         continue to develop and acquire valuable Confidential Information,
         including information which I may develop or discover while performing
         consulting services for IndyMac. The value of that Confidential
         Information depends on its remaining confidential. IndyMac depends on
         me to maintain that confidentiality, and I accept that position of
         trust. I understand that the provisions of this Agreement are a
         material condition to my being allowed to perform consulting services
         for IndyMac.

                  (b)      As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information"
         means any trade secrets or any other material or information
         proprietary to IndyMac or designated as confidential by IndyMac,
         whether or not owned or developed by IndyMac (including information of
         or about its officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers,
         joint venturers, licensors, licensees, distributors and other persons
         and entities with whom IndyMac does business or to whom IndyMac

                                       10
<PAGE>
         owes a duty of confidentiality), which I develop, or which I may obtain
         knowledge of or access to, through or as a result of my relationship
         with IndyMac (including information which I conceive, originate,
         discover or develop, in whole or in part). "Confidential Information"
         shall include, without limitation, the following types of information
         and other information of a similar nature (whether or not reduced to
         writing or still in development): trade secrets, formulae, patterns,
         compilations, devices, methods, techniques, processes, designs,
         concepts, drawings, ideas, Inventions, specifications, discoveries,
         models, data, programs, software, source codes, object codes,
         documentation, diagrams, flow charts, research, development plans,
         reports, interpretations, forecasts, proposals, procedures, know-how,
         new product or new technology information, sales and marketing
         information and strategies, communications and systems information,
         employment records and policies, business acquisition plans and
         financial information, including the financial information of any
         IndyMac officer, director, employee, agent, customer or vendor.

                  (c)      I will not disclose, use or reproduce at any time,
         either during or after my performing consulting services for IndyMac,
         any Confidential Information except for the exclusive benefit of
         IndyMac as required by my duties for IndyMac, or as IndyMac expressly
         may consent to in writing. I will cooperate with IndyMac and use my
         best efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure, use or
         reproduction of all Confidential Information.

                  (d)      Upon the completion or termination of my consulting
         services for IndyMac for any reason, I will immediately deliver to
         IndyMac all tangible, written, graphical machine readable and other
         materials (including all copies) in my possession or under my control
         containing, relating to or disclosing any Confidential Information.

                  2.       OWNERSHIP OF INVENTIONS

                  (a)      As used in this Agreement, "Inventions" includes,
         but is not limited to, all Inventions, ideas and copyrightable material
         created or conceived by me in whole or in part, during or after my
         performing consulting services for IndyMac and which are made through
         the use of any Confidential Information or of any of IndyMac's
         equipment, facilities, supplies, time or other resources.

                  (b)      I agree to communicate to IndyMac as promptly and
         fully as practicable all Inventions conceived or reduced to practice by
         me (alone or jointly with others) at any time during and after my
         performing consulting services for IndyMac. I hereby assign to IndyMac
         all my right, title and interest in such Inventions, and all my right,
         title and interest in any patents, copyrights, trademarks (whether or
         not registered) or other proprietary rights based thereon, and that any
         and all such rights shall belong exclusively to IndyMac. I further
         agree that any copyrightable material that I am asked to prepare or
         work on for

                                       11
<PAGE>
         IndyMac shall be considered a "work made for hire" under the Copyright
         Law of the United States and shall belong exclusively to IndyMac. I
         will assist IndyMac (without charge but at no expense to me) at any
         time and in every proper way to obtain for its and/or their own
         benefit, patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights
         for all such Inventions anywhere in the world and to enforce its and/or
         their rights in legal proceedings involving third parties, and to which
         I am not a party.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, I also assign to
         IndyMac all rights which I may have or acquire in any Invention, full
         title to which is required to be in the United States by a contract
         between IndyMac and the United States or any of its agencies.

                  (d)      I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint IndyMac
         and each of its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and
         attorney-in-fact to act for and in my behalf to execute and to file any
         document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
         prosecution, issuance and enforcement of patents, copyrights,
         trademarks and other proprietary rights with the same force and effect
         as if executed and delivered by me.

                  3.       CONFLICTS WITH OTHER ACTIVITIES.

                  (a)      I agree that during my performing consulting services
         for IndyMac, and for one (1) year following the completion or
         termination of my consulting services for IndyMac, regardless of the
         manner of or reason for such termination, I will not, without IndyMac's
         express written consent, contact or solicit employees of IndyMac for
         the purpose of hiring them.

                  (b)      My performing consulting services for IndyMac and my
         compliance with this Agreement do not and will not breach any agreement
         to keep in confidence information acquired by me prior to or outside of
         my performing consulting services for IndyMac. I have not brought and
         will not bring with me to IndyMac for use in performing consulting
         services for IndyMac any materials, documents or information of any
         current or former employer or any third party that are not generally
         available to the public unless I have obtained express written
         authorization from the owner for their possession and use by or for
         IndyMac. I have not entered into, and will not enter into, any
         agreement, either oral or written, in conflict with this Agreement.

                  4.       MISCELLANEOUS

                  (a)      My obligations under this Agreement may not be
         modified or terminated, in whole or in part, except in a writing signed
         by an executive officer of IndyMac. Any waiver by IndyMac of a breach
         of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as
         a waiver of any subsequent breach.

                                       12

                  (b)      Each provision of this Agreement will be treated as a
         separate and independent clause, and the unenforceability of any
         provision will in no way impair the enforceability of any other
         provision. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such provision
         will be construed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting or
         reducing it to the minimum extent necessary to make it legally
         enforceable.

                  (c)      My obligations under this Agreement will survive the
         completion or termination of my consulting services for IndyMac,
         regardless of the manner of such termination. This Agreement will inure
         to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of
         IndyMac.

                  (d)      Any breach of this Agreement likely will cause
         irreparable harm to IndyMac for which money damages could not
         reasonably or adequately compensate IndyMac. Accordingly, I agree that
         IndyMac will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this
         Agreement, in addition to damages and other available remedies.

                  (e)      This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in
         accordance with the laws of the State of California governing a
         contract made and wholly performed within California.

                  (f)      In the event litigation is brought to enforce this
         Agreement, the prevailing or successful party shall be entitled to
         recover from the losing party its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
         of litigation in addition to any other judgment or award it may
         receive.

                  (g)      This Agreement contains the complete agreement
         between IndyMac and me concerning the subject matter hereof and
         supersedes all other agreements and understandings. This Agreement may
         be executed in counterparts.

                                       13

         This Agreement will be deemed effective as of the start of my
performing consulting services for IndyMac.
