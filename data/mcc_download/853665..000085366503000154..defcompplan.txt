Inc.  Nonqualified  Deferred  Compensation Plan (hereinafter  referred to as the

include one (1) or more subaccounts to reflect amounts credited to a Participant
under the various terms of this Plan.

Delaware company.


          2.10   Compensation   "Compensation"   shall   mean   an   Executive's

          2.11  Deferral  Agreement  "Deferral  Agreement"  means a written form
provided by the Committee  that the Committee  receives from an Executive by the
applicable Election Date, on which the Executive may elect the following for the
Plan Year immediately following the applicable Election Date:

          (a)  The  percentage  of  the  Executive's  Gross  Base  Salary  to be
               deferred;

          (b)  The percentage of the Executive's Bonus to be deferred;

          (c)  Whether all or none of the Executive's  Excess  Compensation will
               be deferred; and

          (d)  The Measuring Investments for determining earnings to be credited

deferred  Bonus and any  Employer  Match and Gross Up Bonus,  as those terms are
defined in an Investment For Retirement  Agreement,  that the Participant elects

          2.13  Election  Date  The  "Election  Date"  is the  date by  which an
Executive must submit a valid  Deferral  Agreement to the Committee with respect
to a given Plan Year. The  applicable  Election Date is the last day of the last
payroll  period  ending  prior  to  such  Plan  Year,  or such  earlier  date as

          (a)  Gross Base Salary paid in such Plan Year,

          (b)  Bonus earned in such Plan Year (regardless of when paid).

               on January 5, 2001 is December  22,  2000,  because  December 22,
               2000 is the last day of the last payroll  period  ending prior to
               2001, when that payment of Gross Base Salary will be paid.

               the last payroll  period  ending  prior to 2001,  when that Bonus
               will be earned.

          2.14  Excess  Compensation   "Excess   Compensation"  shall  mean  any
compensation  payable to an Executive by the Company or an Affiliate  for a Plan

Compensation  pursuant  to the terms of this Plan and whose  benefits  hereunder
have not yet been paid.

          2.19 Plan "Plan" means the Applebee's International, Inc. Nonqualified
Deferred  Compensation  Plan as described in this instrument and as amended from
time to time.

Date.

                                  ARTICLE III

                          ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

          3.01  Eligibility  All Executives  shall be eligible to participate in
this  Plan  unless  excluded  from  participation  by action of the Board or the
Company's Chief Executive  Officer.  An Executive who is eligible to participate
immediately  prior to a Change in Control shall remain  eligible to  participate
notwithstanding a Change in Control, except following a Termination of Service.

          3.02  Participation  An  Executive,  after  having been  selected  for
participation by the Committee, shall, as a condition to participation, complete
a duly executed Deferral Agreement that is timely received by the Committee.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                            DEFERRAL OF COMPENSATION

          4.01  Deferral  Amounts  Each  Participant,  so long as he  remains an
Executive, may elect to defer his Compensation as follows:

          (a)  Gross  Base  Salary in any  whole  percentage  up to twenty  five
               percent (25%);

          (b)  Bonus in any whole  percentage up to  twenty-five  percent (25%);
               and

          (c)  All or none of his Excess Compensation.

The Committee in its discretion may change the limits above and may recast the
limits as dollar amounts or otherwise.

          4.02  Deferral  Agreement  An  eligible  Executive  electing  to defer
Compensation  with respect to a given Plan Year must submit his written Deferral
Agreement to the  Committee  on or before the Election  Date for that Plan Year,
unless an individual  becomes an Executive due to being newly hired or promoted,
in which case the Executive may enroll within sixty (60) days after  becoming an
Executive.  A Deferral Agreement for a prior Plan Year shall be considered to be
submitted for subsequent Plan Years unless changed.  Once the Election Date with
respect  to a Deferral  Agreement  passes,  the  Deferred  Compensation  for the
applicable Plan Year may not be changed, except as provided in Article VII.

          4.03 No Elective Deferral Without Agreement A Participant with respect
to whom a valid  Deferral  Agreement  has not been received by the Committee and
executed on behalf of the Company  before the  applicable  Election Date may not
elect to defer any amount of  Compensation  under  this Plan for the  applicable
Plan Year.

          4.04 Duration of Deferral Agreement A Participant's Deferral Agreement
shall  remain in effect  for the Plan  year for  which it  applies,  and for all
future Plan Years until the Participant files a new Deferral Agreement, receives
an in-service  withdrawal  pursuant to Section 7.02(f) or a hardship  withdrawal
pursuant to Section 8.01, or no longer is eligible to  participate  in the Plan.
The terms of any Deferral  Agreement  may, but need not be, similar to the terms
of any prior Deferral Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V

                              MATCHING CONTRIBUTION

          5.01 Matching Contribution.  The Company shall credit each Participant
with a matching  contribution each Plan Year. The matching contribution shall be
made with  respect to the  Participant's  deferrals  under this Plan at the same
rate as matching  contributions  under the Company's  401(k) Savings Plan. To be
eligible  for a matching  contribution  for a Plan Year, a  Participant  must be
employed  on the last day of such Plan Year,  unless the  Participant  has died,
terminated on or after  attaining age 59 1/2 or become  disabled during the Plan
Year. Any matching contribution will be credited to the Participant's account as
of the date  contributed.  Participants  will be fully  vested  in all  matching
contributions credited to their accounts.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             ACCOUNTS AND CREDITING

          6.01  Accounts  The amount of a  Participant's  Deferred  Compensation
shall  be  credited  to a  separate  Bookkeeping  Account  for the  Participant.
Matching  contributions for a Participant and earnings thereon shall be credited
to the  Bookkeeping  Account  for the  Participant.  Deferred  Compensation  and
matching  contributions shall be credited to separate subaccounts maintained for
the Participant's Bookkeeping Account.

          6.02  Earnings As of each  Valuation  Date and such other times as the
Committee may designate,  the amount credited to each Participant's  Bookkeeping
Account shall be credited with earnings and losses.  The rate at which  earnings
and losses shall be credited to a  Participant's  Bookkeeping  Account  shall be
determined in accordance with one or more Measuring  Investments selected by the
Participant;  if a  Participant  does not  select  a  Measuring  Investment  the
Measuring  Investment  applicable for that Participant  shall be selected by the
Committee.  The  Participant's  Bookkeeping  Account  shall be credited  with an
amount  equal to the deemed net  earnings  or losses that would have been earned
(lost),  if the Company had invested the amounts  credited to the  Participant's
Bookkeeping Account in the Measuring  Investments.  Such net earnings and losses
shall be determined  pursuant to the method or methods deemed appropriate by the
Committee  in its  discretion,  which  methods may be  different  for  different
Measuring  Investments,  may vary  from  time to time,  need not be the same for
determining net earnings versus losses, and may be based on the cash receipts or
the accrual method with any modifications deemed appropriate by the Committee in
its discretion;  provided, however, that the Measuring Investments and method of
determining net earnings and losses in effect at the time of a Change in Control
shall remain in effect until  termination of the Plan unless the Plan is amended
pursuant to Section 14.04 of the Plan.

Except as provided above, the Committee may remove or add Measuring  Investments
at any time in its sole  and  absolute  discretion.  If a  Measuring  Investment
elected by a  Participant  is removed,  a Measuring  Investment  selected by the
Committee  shall apply in its place until the  Participant  elects a replacement
Measuring   Investment.   For  purposes  of  calculating   earnings  and  losses
attributable  to a  Measuring  Investment,  any  amount  shall be  deemed  to be
invested in the Measuring  Investment as of the date  determined  appropriate by


                                       5
<PAGE>

the Committee.  Provided a Change in Control has not occurred, the Committee may
adjust any amount of deemed net earnings or losses which would otherwise be paid
or  debited,  respectively,  to take into  account the  hypothetical  tax effect
thereof  on  the  Company  or its  shareholders  determined  appropriate  by the
Committee.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                  DISTRIBUTION

          7.01 Amount of Benefits The Company's  liability to any Participant at
any time hereunder  shall be an amount equal to the dollar amount  credited to a
Participant's  Bookkeeping  Account as of the Valuation Date  coincident with or
immediately preceding such date.

          7.02 Time and Method of Payment

          (a)  Deferrals Prior to January 1, 2002.  Notwithstanding  anything to
               the  contrary,  payment  of  the  entire  amount  credited  to  a
               Participant's   Bookkeeping  Account  attributable  to  deferrals
               credited  before January 1, 2001 shall be made in accordance with
               the terms of this Plan prior to this restatement.

          (b)  Termination  of Service.  If a Participant  has a Termination  of
               Service,  all  amounts  credited to a  Participant's  Bookkeeping
               Account shall be paid to the Participant within 90 days after his
               Termination  of Service,  or as soon  thereafter as is reasonably
               practicable.

          (c)  Disability.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary,  in the
               event of the Participant's disability prior to the payment of the
               amount credited to the Participant's Bookkeeping Account, payment
               of such amount  shall be made to the  Participant  within 90 days
               after the  Participant  is determined to be disabled,  or as soon
               thereafter  as is  reasonably  practicable.  Disability  for this
               purpose  shall  be  determined  under  the  Company's  long  term
               disability plan as it exists at the time of disability.

          (d)  Death.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of
               the  Participant's  death  prior  to the  payment  of the  amount
               credited to the Participant's  Bookkeeping Account, payment shall
               be made to the Participant's Beneficiary within 90 days after the
               Participant's  death,  or as  soon  thereafter  as is  reasonably
               practicable.

          (e)  In-Service  Withdrawal.  Upon  a  Participant's  request,  in the
               manner  and at the  time  designated  by  and  acceptable  to the
               Committee,  prior to any other time for  payment  set out in this
               Section  7.02,  payment  shall be made to the  Participant  of an
               amount  up to 100% of the  Participant's  Deferred  Compensation,

               10% of the  amount  of  the  payment  pursuant  to  this  Section
               7.02(e),  which  10%  amount  shall be  forfeited  as of the time

               be made  within 90 days after the  Participant's  request,  or as
               soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A Participant shall

          (f)  If a  Participant  receives a payment  pursuant  to this  Section
               7.02(f),  the Committee shall suspend future salary  deferrals by
               such  Participant  for a  period  of 6 months  after  the date of
               payment. Following the suspension period, deferrals automatically
               shall resume in accordance with the Deferral  Agreement in effect
               at the time suspension  commenced  unless the Participant  elects
               prior to resumption,  and prior to the beginning of the Plan Year
               next  following  the start of the  period of  suspension,  not to
               resume deferrals.

          7.03 Timing and Form of Payment In lieu of the distribution  times set
out in Section  7.02,  a  Participant  may elect at least 12 months prior to the
date the  Participant  becomes  entitled to a distribution to receive a complete
distribution of the amount credited to the Participant's  Accounts  hereunder as
follows:

          (a)  In a lump sum cash payment in January  immediately  following the
               Plan Year in which the Participant terminates employment with the
               Company; or

          (b)  If a  Participant's  Termination  of  Service  occurs on or after
               attainment  of age 59 1/2, in five annual  cash  installments  of
               reasonably  equal  amounts   beginning  in  January   immediately
               following  the Plan  Year in  which  the  Participant  terminates
               employment with the Company,  provided the amount credited to the
               Participant's  accounts  exceeds a threshold  amount  established
               from time to time by the Committee.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS

          8.01  Hardship  At the  request of a  Participant  before or after the
Participant's  retirement or Termination  of Service,  the Committee may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, accelerate and cause all or part of the value of a
Participant's  Deferred  Compensation  to be  paid  within  90 days  after  such
request,  or as  soon  thereafter  as  is  reasonably  practicable.  Accelerated
payments at the request of the  Participant or the  Participant's  Beneficiaries
may be allowed only in the event of a financial  hardship,  as defined below, to
the Participant or Beneficiary.  An accelerated  distribution must be limited to
only that amount  necessary to relieve the hardship.  In the event the Committee
determines the existence of a hardship and accelerates  payments  hereunder to a
Participant,  it shall suspend future salary deferrals by such Participant for a
period of 6 months after the date of the hardship  distribution.  Following  the
suspension period,  deferrals  automatically shall resume in accordance with the
Deferral  Agreement  in  effect  at the time  suspension  commenced  unless  the
Participant elects prior to resumption,  and, prior to the beginning of the next
Plan Year to commence after the suspension  commenced,  not to resume deferrals.
If a Participant  who is a member of the Committee  makes a request  pursuant to
this Section 8.01,  such  Participant  shall not  participate in the Committee's
deliberations with respect to his request.

                  For the purposes hereof, the term "financial hardship" shall
mean an immediate and heavy financial need caused by one or more of the
following:

          (a)  Unreimbursed  and   unreimbursable   expenses  for  medical  care
               described  in Code  Section  213(d)  previously  incurred  by the
               Participant,  the Participant's  spouse, or any dependents of the
               Participant  (as defined in Code Section  152) or  necessary  for
               these  persons to obtain  medical care  described in Code Section
               213(d);

          (b)  Payment  of tuition  and  related  educational  fees and room and
               board for the next twelve months of post-secondary  education for
               the  Participant,  his or her spouse,  children or dependents (as
               defined in Code Section 152);

          (c)  Payments  necessary  to prevent the  eviction of the  Participant
               from his principal  residence or  foreclosure  on the mortgage of
               the Participant's principal residence; or

          (d)  Costs directly  related to the purchase of a principal  residence
               for the Participant (excluding mortgage payments).

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   BENEFICIARY

          9.01  Beneficiary   Designation  A  Participant  shall  designate  his
Beneficiary to receive  benefits  under the Plan by completing  the  appropriate
form provided by the Committee.  If more than one (1) Beneficiary is named,  the
shares and/or percentage of each Beneficiary  shall be indicated.  A Participant
shall have the right to change the  Beneficiary by submitting to the Committee a
Change of Beneficiary Form. However, no change of Beneficiary shall be effective
until  acknowledged,  in  writing,  by  the  Committee  or  its  designee.  If a
Participant  does not designate a  Beneficiary,  the  Participant's  Beneficiary
shall be his surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, his estate.

          9.02 Proper  Beneficiary If the Company has any doubt as to the proper
Beneficiary to receive payments  hereunder,  the Company shall have the right to
withhold such payments  until the matter is finally  adjudicated.  However,  any
payment made by the  Company,  in good faith and in  accordance  with this Plan,
shall fully discharge the Company and the Committee from all further obligations
with respect to that payment.

          9.03 Minor or Incompetent Beneficiary In making any payments to or for
the benefit of any minor or an incompetent  Beneficiary,  the Committee,  in its
sole and  absolute  discretion,  may make a  distribution  to a legal or natural
guardian  or other  relative  of a minor or court  appointed  committee  of such
incompetent.  Or,  it may make a  payment  to any  adult  with whom the minor or
incompetent  temporarily  or  permanently  resides.  The  receipt by a guardian,
committee,  relative  or other  person  shall  be a  complete  discharge  to the
Company.  Neither the Committee nor the Company shall have any responsibility to
see to the proper application of any payments so made.

expenses  and  liabilities  arising out of his  membership  on the  Committee or
administration of the Plan or any action or failure to act by the Committee, any

of the Participants  and their  Beneficiaries.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary,  as soon as practicable  following the  termination of the Plan,  each

(or former Participant) to successfully enforce his valid rights under this Plan
shall be paid by the Company in addition to sums due under this Plan.
