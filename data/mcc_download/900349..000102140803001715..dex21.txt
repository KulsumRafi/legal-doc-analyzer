and the Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger;

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously has
determined and resolved that the Merger and all of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are in the best interest of the holders of Company Common
Stock and that the Merger is fair and advisable, and has approved this Agreement

Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Merger shall

                                   ARTICLE II

                    EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                        OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and automatically without any action on the part of any holder of
capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, respectively:

              (a)     Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each then outstanding share
of common stock, $.00l par value, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, $.001 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

              (b)     Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock then issued and held in the Company's
treasury or by any of the Company's subsidiaries, and each share of Company
Common Stock then owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

              (c)     Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the
provisions of the last paragraph of this Section 2.1 (c), each then outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (including each associated right to purchase
Company Junior Preferred Stock distributed as a dividend on May 28, 2002 (each,
a "Right", and collectively the "Rights") pursuant to that certain Rights
Agreement dated as of May 17, 2002, as amended, between the Company and Mellon
Investor Services, LLC, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement")) (other than
shares cancelled and retired pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares),
shall be converted into and become the right to receive:

                      (i)   subject to Section 2.2, such fraction of a duly
              authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
              Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Parent Stock
              Consideration"); and

                      (ii)  $5.3538 in cash (the "Cash Consideration");
              provided, however, if the Parent Average Stock Price is less than
              $12.00, the Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount
              equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the difference
              between (1) $39,000,000 and (2) the product of 3,250,000 and the
              Parent Average Stock Price by (y) 9,712,809.

         For purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient
obtained by dividing $4.0153 by the Parent Average Stock Price; provided,
however, if the Parent Average Stock Price is less than $12.00, the "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean and be fixed at 0.3346. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Parent Average Stock Price" means the arithmetic average of the closing sale
prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market
("Nasdaq") for the 20-consecutive full trading days ending on the third full
trading day next preceding the Closing Date. The Exchange Ratio shall be
calculated to the nearest ten

                                       3

<PAGE>

thousandth of a share of Parent Common Stock and the Parent Average Stock Price
shall be calculated to the nearest ten thousandth of one cent. The Cash
Consideration and Parent Stock Consideration are sometimes hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Merger Consideration."

         For purposes of clarity and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall (i) the amount of Parent Stock Consideration to be issued in the Merger to
the holders of Company Common Stock (plus the amount of Parent Common Stock to
be issued to the holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.6)
exceed, in the aggregate, 3,250,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the
value of the Merger Consideration to be paid and delivered in the aggregate to
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger (plus the aggregate amount of cash
to be paid in the Merger in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.2 and the value of the aggregate amount of cash and Parent
Common Stock to be paid and delivered to the holders of Company Stock Options
pursuant to Section 2.6) exceed $91,000,000.

         SECTION 2.2 Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Stock Certificates, no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate
to such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of
Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Company Stock
Certificate who otherwise would have been entitled to receive in the Merger a
fractional share interest in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall
receive in lieu and stead thereof from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest
to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) otherwise would be entitled by
(y) the Parent Average Stock Price.

         SECTION 2.3  Exchange of Certificates.

              (a)     As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, or
such other bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.3, (i)
certificates representing the aggregate Parent Stock Consideration issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (ii) cash representing the aggregate Cash
Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such shares of Parent Common
Stock together with all dividends and distributions applicable thereto as
specified in Section 2.3(c) and the Cash Consideration being hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund").

              (b)     As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
(or certificates) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates")
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of such certificates) (the "Letter of Transmittal") to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the
Exchange Agent reasonably may specify, together with a

                                       4

<PAGE>

substitute Form W-9) and (ii) instructions for use thereof in surrendering
Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2 and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3(c)). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company
Stock Certificate in proper form for cancellation, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate (or certificates)
representing such whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock such Company
stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in such
denominations and registered in such names as such holder may request and a
check representing the Cash Consideration that such Company stockholder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (ii) a check representing the
amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, which such Company stockholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, in all cases after giving effect
to the payment of all required withholding Taxes. The shares represented by the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (and notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement), no interest shall be paid or accrued in respect
of any of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, and the unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Company Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered
on the stock transfer books and records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and a check
representing the Cash Consideration that such holder of Company Common Stock is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), plus a check representing the
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and the unpaid dividends
and distributions, if any, to which such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with this Article II, will be issued to such transferee only if a
Company Stock Certificate held by such transferee is properly presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that all applicable stock transfer Taxes
theretofore have been paid. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.3 and as specified in the Letter of Transmittal, each Company Stock
Certificate shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
plus the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, as provided in this Article II. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
a check for the Cash Consideration that such holder of Company Common Stock is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), plus the cash to be paid in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, and the unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, as provided in this Article II.

                                       5

<PAGE>

              (c)     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock having a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder, until the holder shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate
as provided in this Section 2.3. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, in each case without any interest thereon, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of all required withholding
Taxes in respect thereof, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the date of such surrender and having a
payment date subsequent to the date of such surrender and payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of all required
withholding Taxes in respect thereof.

              (d)     All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and Cash
Consideration paid upon surrender of Company Stock Certificates in accordance
with this Article II and as specified in the Letter of Transmittal (including
any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock represented thereby and, as of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books and records of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books and records of the
Company of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are
properly presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason (but otherwise in
accordance with this Article II and as specified in the Letter of Transmittal),
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.3.

              (e)     At any time following the six-month anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any remaining portion of the Exchange Fund not theretofore
distributed to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including any
interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from
investments thereof by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and such
former holders shall be entitled to look only to the Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
and dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock, if
any, payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock Certificates, in all
cases without any interest thereon and less all required withholding Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration
(or dividends or distributions in respect thereof) or cash from the Exchange
Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

              (f)     The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest, proceeds and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.3(e).

                                       6

<PAGE>

If the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to satisfy fully all of
the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, then Parent
promptly shall, from time to time, deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
satisfy fully such payment obligations.

          (g)  Each of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options such Taxes and other amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and pursuant to the applicable provisions of state,
local and foreign Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld
and paid to the applicable taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted, withheld and paid amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as the
case may be, in respect of which such deduction, withholding and payment was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent.

     SECTION 2.4  Certain Adjustments. If after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time and to the extent permitted by this Agreement, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number, class or series of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization or combination, forward stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall
occur (any such action, an "Adjustment Event"), the Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted correspondingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock
the right to receive the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
immediately prior to such Adjustment Event and Parent's payment obligations
likewise shall be correspondingly adjusted such that it shall be required to pay
and deliver not more than the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by
this Agreement.

     SECTION 2.5  Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Subject to Section 6.2(e),
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are
held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration; provided, however, if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL, each share of
such holder's Company Common Stock thereupon shall be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1(c). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of
all demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received
by the Company prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the DGCL and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands and notices. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise compromise or negotiate, any such demands.

                                       7

<PAGE>

     SECTION 2.6  Stock Options.

          (a)  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, not
later than 45 days after the date hereof, from each holder of outstanding
options (whether or not then exercisable or vested) to acquire Company Common
Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option" and
collectively, the "Company Stock Options"), an executed agreement substantially
in the form of Section 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case
providing that automatically at the Effective Time (i) each Company Stock Option
held by such holder shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, (ii)
each then outstanding Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and void, (iii) in
consideration of such vesting and cancellation, each Company Stock Option shall
thereupon represent for all purposes under the relevant Company Stock Plan and
all grant and award instruments and agreements governing and evidencing such
holder's Company Stock Option(s) only the right to receive (subject to Section
2.3(g) and the last paragraph of Section 2.1(c)) such amount of Parent Common
Stock and cash ratably in the same proportion in which the Parent Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration shall be delivered and paid in accordance
with Section 2.1(c)) equal to, for each Company Stock Option, the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the then outstanding
Company Stock Options held by such holder and (y) the excess (to the extent a
positive number) of $9.3691 over the then applicable per share exercise price of
each such Company Stock Option (such amount of Parent Common Stock and cash
being so paid in full settlement of and in consideration for cancellation of
each such Company Stock Option being hereinafter referred to as the "Option
Consideration"), payable as provided in Section 2.6(b), and (iv) from and after
the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 2.6, such holder shall
not have any rights or benefits under any Company Stock Plan or Company Stock
Option (or any grant or award letter or agreement issued in respect thereof) to
acquire any securities of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary of Parent and shall, by virtue of having effected such surrender,
cancellation and receipt of Option Consideration, have unconditionally and
irrevocably discharged and released Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective subsidiaries, officers, directors and
affiliates from and against, and thereupon shall have permanently waived, all
rights and claims (fixed, contingent or otherwise) such holder may now or
hereafter have thereunder with respect to all Company Stock Plans and Company
Stock Options (and all grant and award instruments and agreements governing and
evidencing the same).

shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a
Company Stock Option the Option Consideration (net of any applicable withholding
tax as provided in Section 2.3(g)) in respect thereof. Until settled in

          (c)  The Company promptly shall use its best efforts (including
causing the Board of Directors of the Company or any compensation, stock option,
corporate governance, special or other duly constituted committee thereof to

Company Stock Option nor any party to or participant in any of the Company Stock
Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof and (ii)
the Company Stock Plans and all Company Stock Options (and all grant and award
letters and agreements issued in respect thereof) shall terminate and become
void as of the Effective Time. The Company shall permit each holder of Company
Stock Options to satisfy any withholding Tax and other payments in respect of
such holder under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and pursuant to the applicable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax laws,

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     SECTION 3.1  Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement which hereby is incorporated by reference in and
constitutes an integral part of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") and making specific reference to the particular subsection(s) of this
Agreement to which exception is being taken or as set forth in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 29, 2001 and any
other periodic Exchange Act reports filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since March 29, 2002 (in which case specific
reference thereto shall be made in the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

          (a)  Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

               (i)  Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation or
          other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
          standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized
          and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be,
          and requisite authority to carry on its business as presently being
          conducted. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified
          or licensed to conduct business and is in good standing in each
          jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
          leasing or operation of its properties or other jurisdictional
          presence makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
          those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
          or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate would not
          reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
          Company or the applicable subsidiary.

               (ii) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent prior
          to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the
          certificate of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational
          documents, as amended to date, of the Company and its subsidiaries.

                                       9

          correct records of all meetings and accurately reflect all consents,
          resolutions and other material actions taken by the stockholders, the

all other restrictions (including restrictions on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests) that would
prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of such subsidiary's business
as presently conducted. Except as set forth above or in Section 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock of or other equity or voting interests in any person.

rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (iv), any

         (ii)  The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
included in Company SEC Documents (including the related notes) complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (including, without limitation,

accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Quarterly Report Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods and at the dates involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that were not, or with respect to any such

amount or effect). Except (A) as reflected in the Company's unaudited balance

pursuant to GAAP) or (B) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business since September 28, 2002 consistent with past practice or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations of any
nature. Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have expressed their opinion with respect to

subsidiaries at December 28, 2002, and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the Company's fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002 (including the related notes and schedules thereto), a true
and complete copy of which heretofore has been delivered by the Company to
Parent (the "Unaudited Year-End Financial Statements"), comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and

                                       13

<PAGE>

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (including, without limitation,
Regulation S-X), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the fiscal year ended and at December 28, 2002 (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries at December 28, 2002 and
the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the Company's fiscal year ended December 28, 2002 (subject to
notes and normal year-end audit adjustments); provided, however, that such
Unaudited Year-End Financial Statements shall not be deemed to be a fair
presentation of the consolidated income from continuing operations before
interest, income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary gain and
depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of the Company and its subsidiaries or
the consolidated net sales of the Company and its subsidiaries for purposes of
this Section 3.1(e)(iii) if either the consolidated EBITDA or the consolidated
net sales of the Company and its subsidiaries as reflected in the audited
consolidated statements of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries for
the Company's fiscal year ended December 28, 2002 (the "Audited Year-End
Financial Statements") are less than $19.250 million or $210.2 million,
respectively. Non-capitalized and non-recurring out-of-pocket, cash transaction
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent not included in the consolidated
EBITDA and consolidated net sales amounts heretofore disclosed by the Company to
Parent shall not be counted toward the determination of such consolidated EBITDA
or consolidated net sales of the Company and its subsidiaries for purposes of
the foregoing proviso.

         (iv) Each of the Company, its directors and its senior financial
officers has consulted with the Company's independent auditors and with the
Company's outside counsel with respect to, and (to the extent applicable to the
Company) is familiar in all material respects with all of the requirements of,
SOXA. The Company is in compliance with the provisions of SOXA applicable to it
as of the date hereof and has implemented such programs and has taken reasonable
steps, upon the advice of the Company's independent auditors and outside
counsel, respectively, to ensure the Company's future compliance (not later than
the relevant statutory and regulatory deadlines therefor) with all provisions of
SOXA which shall become applicable to the Company after the date hereof. All
financial projections and forecasts heretofore furnished to Parent, with respect
to fiscal periods commencing after December 28, 2002, were prepared by the
Company's management in good faith on the basis of reasonable assumptions (based
on the best information and estimates currently available to management when
made).

         (f)  Certain Contracts. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by or otherwise subject to (a) any agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding relating to the incurring of
indebtedness by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including sale and
leaseback transaction in excess of $250,000 and including capitalized lease
transactions and other similar financing transactions) including, without
limitation, any such agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding which
contains provisions which in any non-de minimis manner restrict, or may
restrict, the conduct of business as presently conducted by the issuer thereof
or borrower, guarantor or obligor thereunder (collectively, "Instruments of
Indebtedness"), (b) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601
(b) (10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (c) any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to restrict or limit in any respect
(i) the ability of the Company or its subsidiaries to solicit customers or (ii)
the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any

                                       14

<PAGE>

material portion of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole or, following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and its subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, (d) any
agreement providing for the indemnification or surety by the Company or a
subsidiary of the Company of any person, other than customary agreements
relating to the indemnification of directors or officers of the Company or its
subsidiaries, (e) any strategic alliance, revenue sharing joint venture or
partnership agreement, (f) any agreement that grants any right of first or last
refusal or right of first or last offer or similar right or that limits or
purports to limit the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to own,
operate, sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any material amount of
assets or business, (g) any contract or agreement providing for any material
future payments that are conditioned, in whole or in part, on a change of
control of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (h) any collective bargaining
agreement, (i) any employment agreement or any agreement or arrangement that
contains any material severance pay or post-employment liabilities or
obligations to any current or former employee of the Company or its subsidiaries
(any such person, hereinafter, an "Employee"), other than as required under law,
(j) any material agreement pertaining to the use of or granting of any right to
use or practice any rights under any Intellectual Property, whether the Company
is the licensee or licensor thereunder, (k) any agreements pursuant to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries leases or uses any real property, and (l) any
contract or other agreement not made in the ordinary course of business which is
material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or which
reasonably would be expected to delay the consummation of the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the agreements, contracts and
obligations of the type described in clauses (a) through (l) being referred to
herein as "Company Material Contracts"). Each Company Material Contract is valid
and binding on and enforceable against the Company (or, to the extent a
subsidiary of the Company is a party, such subsidiary) and, to the knowledge of
the Company, each other party thereto and is in full force and effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in breach or default under any
Company Material Contract. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company
knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, does there exist any condition which with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or
default under) any Company Material Contract by any other party thereto. Prior
to the date hereof, the Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all Company Material Contracts. There are no provisions in any
Instrument of Indebtedness that provide any restrictions on, or that require
that any financial payment (other than payment of outstanding principal and
accrued interest) be made in the event of, the repayment of the outstanding
indebtedness thereunder prior to its term.

         (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, since December 29, 2001, the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in the ordinary course, and since such date
there has not been:

             (i) any material adverse change in the Company or any event which
         either individually or when aggregated with any other event(s) has or
         reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
         Company,

          Company's capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any
          issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
          substitution for shares of the Company's capital stock, except for

          or any of its subsidiaries to any current or former director,
          executive officer or other Employee of any increase in compensation,
          bonus, perquisites, incentive payments or other benefits except in the
          ordinary course of business, (B) any granting by the Company or any of
          its subsidiaries to any such current or former director, executive
          officer or Employee of any increase in severance or termination pay,
          or (C) any entry by the Company or any of its subsidiaries into, or
          any amendment of, any employment, deferred compensation, consulting,

          contingencies, intercompany loans, credit collections, including
          without limitation, any reserving, renewal, reversal, deferral,

               premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
               "PBGC"), have been or will be paid in full with regard to such
               Employee Plans for policy years or other applicable policy
               periods ending on or before the Closing Date by the Closing Date.
               As of the date hereof, none of the Employee Plans has unfunded
               benefit liabilities, as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA.

                   (iv)  Section 3.1(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
               contains a true and complete list of all "multi-employer plans,"
               as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or
               Section 414, that the Company and/or any ERISA Affiliate
               contributes to, or is or was obligated to contribute to, during
               the five-year period prior to the date hereof (the
               "Multi-Employer Plans"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA
               Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any withdrawal
               liability to any Multi-Employer Plan in connection with any
               complete or partial withdrawal from such plan occurring on or
               before the Closing Date. No condition exists and no event has
               occurred with respect to any Multi-Employer Plan that presents a
               material risk of a complete or partial withdrawal under Title IV
               of ERISA. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have made all
               required contributions to all Multi-Employer Plans. To the
               knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any ERISA
               Affiliate has incurred any reduction in contribution base units
               which, if continued, would result in a partial withdrawal from a
               multi-employer plan.

                   (v)   With respect to each Employee Plan (i) no prohibited
               transactions as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
               of the Code have occurred or are expected to occur as a result of
               the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
               (ii) no action, suit, grievance, arbitration or other type of

                                       23

               litigation, or claim with respect to the assets of any Employee
               Plan (other than routine claims for benefits made in the ordinary
               course of plan administration for which plan administrative
               review procedures have not been exhausted) is pending or, to the
               knowledge of the Company, threatened or imminent against the
               Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary, as such term is
               defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA ("Fiduciary"), including, but
               not limited to, any action, suit, grievance, arbitration or other
               type of litigation, or claim regarding conduct that allegedly
               interferes with the attainment of rights under any Employee Plan
               and (iii) the Company has no knowledge of any facts which would
               give rise to or could give rise to any such actions, suits,
               grievances, arbitration or other type of litigation, or claims
               with respect to any Employee Plan. To the knowledge of the
               Company, neither the Company, nor its directors, officers,
               Employees or any Fiduciary has any liability for failure to
               comply with ERISA or the Code for any action or failure to act in
               connection with the administration or investment of such plan.
               None of the Employee Plans is subject to any pending
               investigations or to the knowledge of the Company threatened
               investigations from any Governmental Agencies who enforce
               applicable laws under ERISA and the Code.

                    (vi)   Each of the Employee Plans is, and has been, operated
               in accordance with its terms and each of the Employee Plans, and
               administration thereof, is, and has been, in all material
               respects in compliance with the requirements of any and all
               applicable statutes, orders or governmental rules or regulations
               currently in effect, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the
               Code. All required reports and descriptions of the Employee Plans
               (including but not limited to Form 5500 Annual Reports, Form 1024
               Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(a),
               Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions) have been
               timely filed and distributed as required by ERISA and the Code.
               Any notices required by ERISA or the Code or any other state or
               federal law or any ruling or regulation of any state or federal
               administrative agency with respect to the Employee Plans,
               including but not limited to any notices required by Section
               204(h), Section 606 or Section 4043 of ERISA or Section 4980B of
               the Code, have been appropriately given.

                    (vii)  The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
               with respect to each Employee Plan intended to be "qualified"
               within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code that has not
               been revoked and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
               circumstances exist that could adversely affect the qualified
               status of any such plan and the exemption under Section 501(a) of
               the Code of the trust maintained thereunder. Each Employee Plan
               intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 125, 501(c)(9) or
               501(c)(17) of the Code has satisfied such requirements in all
               material respects.

                    (viii) With respect to each Employee Plan to which the
               Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make,
               contributions on behalf of any Employee during the five-year
               period ending on the last day of the most recent plan year end
               prior to the Closing Date, (a) no liability under Title IV or
               Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any
               ERISA Affiliate that has

                                       24

<PAGE>

               not been satisfied in full, and (b) to the knowledge of the
               Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to the
               Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability,
               other than liability for premiums due to the PBGC and (c) the
               present value of accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the
               actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most
               recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with
               respect to such plan did not exceed, as of its latest valuation
               date, the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable
               to such accrued benefits. No Employee Plan or any trust
               established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding
               deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412
               of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
               most recently ended fiscal year.

                    (ix)   No Employee Plan provides medical, surgical,
               hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not
               insured) for Employees for periods extending beyond their
               retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
               coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, Section 601 of
               ERISA or other applicable law, (ii) death benefits under any
               "pension plan," (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by
               the Employee (or his beneficiary) or (iv) Employee Plans that can
               be amended or terminated by the Company without consent. The
               Company does not have any current or projected liability with
               respect to post-employment or post-retirement welfare benefits
               for retired, former, or current Employees of the Company.

                    (x)    No material amounts payable under the Employee Plans
               will fail to be deductible for Federal income tax purposes by
               virtue of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                    (xi)   To the extent that the Company or any of its
               subsidiaries is deemed to be a fiduciary with respect to any Plan
               that is subject to ERISA, the Company or such subsidiary (1)
               during the past five years has complied with the requirements of
               ERISA and the Code in the performance of its duties and
               responsibilities with respect to such employee benefit plan and
               (2) has not knowingly caused any of the trusts for which it
               serves as an investment manager, as defined in Section 3(38) of
               ERISA, to enter into any transaction that would constitute a
               "prohibited transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
               4975 of the Code, with respect to any such trusts, except for
               transactions that are the subject of a statutory or
               administrative exemption.

                    (xii)  No person will be entitled to a "gross up" or other
               similar payment in respect of excise taxes under Section 4999 of
               the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
               Agreement.

                    (xiii) None of the Employee Plans have been completely or
               partially terminated and none has been the subject of a
               "reportable event" as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
               ERISA (other than events for which the 30-day notice to the PBGC
               has been waived). No proceeding by the PBGC to terminate any
               Employee Plan pursuant to Title IV of ERISA has been instituted
               or, to the

                                       25

               knowledge of the Company, threatened. No amendment has been
               adopted which would require the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to
               provide security pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section
               401(a)(29) of the Code.

               (l)  Labor Matters.

                    (i)   With respect to Employees of the Company and its
               subsidiaries: (i) to the knowledge of the Company, no senior
               executive or key Employee has any plans to terminate employment
               with the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) there is no
               unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or
               any of its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the
               Company or any of its subsidiaries, threatened before the
               National Labor Relations Board or any other comparable
               Governmental Entity; (iii) there is no demand for recognition
               made by any labor organization or petition for election filed
               with the National Labor Relations Board or any other comparable
               Governmental Entity; (iv) no grievance or any arbitration
               proceeding arising out of or under collective bargaining
               agreements is pending and, to the knowledge of Company or any of
               its subsidiaries, no claims therefor have been threatened other
               than grievances or arbitrations incurred in the ordinary course
               of business; (v) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
               the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
               thereby will not give rise to termination of any existing
               collective bargaining agreement or permit any labor organization
               to commence or initiate any negotiations in respect of wages,
               hours, benefits, severance or working conditions under any such
               existing collective bargaining agreements; and (vi) there is no
               litigation, arbitration proceeding, governmental investigation,
               administrative charge, citation or action of any kind pending or,
               to the knowledge of the Company, proposed or threatened against
               the Company relating to employment, employment practices, terms
               and conditions of employment or wages, benefits, severance and
               hours.

                    (ii)  There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or
               lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its
               subsidiaries, threat thereof, by or with respect to any employee
               of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                    (iii) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any
               collective bargaining relationship or duty to bargain with any
               "Labor Organization" (as such term is defined in Section 2(5) of
               the National Labor Relations Act, as amended), and none of the
               Company nor any of its subsidiaries has recognized any labor
               organization as the collective bargaining representative of any
               of its employees.

                    (iv)  Section 3.1(l)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
               lists the name, accrued vacation, the place of employment, the

               compensation, "golden parachute" and other like benefits paid or
               payable (in cash or otherwise) in each of the fiscal years ended

               function of each current salaried Employee whose total annual
               compensation exceeds $100,000, officer and director of the
               Company and of each current consultant or agent of the Company
               whose total annual compensation for services provided exceeds
               $100,000 who is employed or otherwise engaged by the Company. The
               execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
               the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i)
               result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
               compensation, tax gross-up, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to
               any current or former director, employee or independent
               contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, from the
               Company or any of its subsidiaries under any Plan, (ii)
               materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
               Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
               exercise or vesting of any such benefits.

                    (v)   Section 3.1(l)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
               sets forth all contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements
               covering any Employee of the Company or its subsidiaries
               containing "change of control," "stay-put," transition,
               retention, severance or similar provisions, and sets forth the
               names and titles of all such Employees, the amounts payable under
               such provisions, whether such provisions would become payable as
               a result of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
               Agreement, and when such amounts would be payable to such
               Employees, all of which are in writing, have heretofore been duly
               approved by the Company's Board of Directors or the compensation
               committee thereof, and true and complete copies of all of which
               have heretofore been delivered to Parent. Other than as set forth
               in Section 3.1(l)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
               are no contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements (oral or
               written) covering any Employee of the Company or its subsidiaries
               with "change of control," "stay-put," severance or similar
               provisions. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
               (oral or written) covering any Employee of the Company that
               individually or collectively could give rise to the payment of
               any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of
               Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
               Affiliate has incurred any liability under the Worker Adjustment
               and Retraining Act or any similar state law relating to
               employment termination in connection with a mass layoff, plant
               closing or similar event.

               (m)  Environmental Matters. Except for such matters which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the Company and are listed in Section 3.1(m) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:

                    (i)   the Company has obtained all permits, approvals and
               authorizations required under Environmental Laws (hereinafter
               "Environmental Permits"), and is and has been in compliance with
               all requirements under such Environmental Permits and
               Environmental Laws;

                    (ii)  there are no present or past Releases (1) at any
               properties currently owned or operated by the Company, (2) at any
               properties formerly owned or operated by the Company that are
               attributable to the operations of the Company,

                                       27

<PAGE>

               (3) at any facility that received Hazardous Substances generated
               by the Company or (4) exposure of any persons from a Release
               attributable to the operations of the Company that has or would
               reasonably be expected to form the basis of any assertion of any
               claim under Environmental Laws, against the Company;

                    (iii)  no Lien has been placed or threatened to be placed
               upon any of the current or, to the Company's knowledge, past
               Company Properties under any Environmental Law that is
               attributable to the operations of the Company;

                    (iv)   there has been no environmental investigation, study,
               audit, test, review or other analysis conducted in relation to
               any of the current operations or Company Properties or any other
               operations or properties or facilities of the Company or its
               subsidiaries, now or to the Company's knowledge, previously owned
               or leased by the Company, which is in the possession or control
               of the Company and has not been delivered to the Parent at least
               ten (10) days prior to the date hereof;

                    (v)    no Environmental Law imposes any obligation upon the
               Company arising out of or as a condition to any transaction
               contemplated by this Agreement, including any requirement to
               modify or transfer any Environmental Permits, any requirement to
               file any notice or other submission with a Governmental Entity,
               the placement of any notice, restriction, acknowledgment or
               covenant in any land records, or the modification of or provision
               of notice under any agreement, consent order or consent decree;

                    (vi)   the Company has not entered into or agreed to, nor
               does any of them contemplate entering into, any consent decree or
               order in respect of the business of the Company or its
               subsidiaries, or any of the Company Properties, and none of them

               business as currently conducted or planned by the Company to be

                    (vi)   Each material item of Software, which is used by the
               Company or its subsidiaries in connection with the operation of

                           (A) Either the Company or its subsidiaries have
               valid, binding and enforceable leasehold interests in and to the

                           (B) Each of the Real Property Leases is in full force
               and effect; the Company or a subsidiary thereof holds a valid
               leasehold interest in, and actual and exclusive possession of,
               the Leased Properties subject thereto, free and clear of all

               to any Real Property Leases which default remains uncured.

                           (D) The Company and its subsidiaries are not in
               material breach or default in respect of any Real Property Lease,
               and to their knowledge no event has occurred which, with due
               notice or lapse of time or both, could constitute such a material
               breach or default, except for such obligations, the
               non-performance of which, and such breaches or defaults, the
               existence of which, in each case, would not result in a
               termination or cancellation of any Real Property Lease.

                           (E) The base monthly rents, percentage rents, real

               force and effect.

                    (v)    All of the buildings, fixtures and improvements
               included on or in the Company Properties and owned or leased by

                    (vi)   To the Company's knowledge and without inquiry (i)
               all certificates of occupancy necessary for the current use and
               operation of each Company Property have been issued and are in
               full force and effect, and (ii) the use of the Company Properties
               is in conformity with such certificates of occupancy in all
               material respects.

                    (vii)  There does not exist any actual or, to the knowledge
               of the Company, threatened or contemplated condemnation or
               eminent domain proceedings that affect any Company Property or
               any material part thereof.

                    (viii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries holds
               a contractual right to purchase or acquire any material real
               estate interest and no person or entity has any option, right of
               first refusal or other contractual right to acquire title to the
               Company Properties or any portion thereof or interest therein.

                    (ix)   To the Company's knowledge, the current use and
               occupancy of the Company Properties and the improvements located
               thereon are not in violation of any material recorded covenants,
               conditions, restrictions, reservations, easements or agreements
               affecting the Company Properties.

                    (x)    To the Company's knowledge, each improvement located
               on the Company Properties which is material to its operation has

               private easement.

                    (xi)   All water, gas and other utilities are sufficient to
               enable the Company Properties to continue to be used and operated
               in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
               practices. With respect to the Owned Properties, said utilities
               either enter the premises through adjoining public streets or, if
               they pass through adjoining private land, do so in accordance
               with legal, valid and enforceable permanent public or private
               easements which will inure to the benefit of the Parent, its
               successors and assigns.

               (x)  Tangible Personal Property. Except as would not materially
impair the Company and its operations or the operations of its subsidiaries, the
machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property
(the "Tangible Personal Property") owned, leased or used by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is in the aggregate sufficient and adequate to carry on
their respective businesses in all material respects as presently conducted and
is, in the aggregate and in all material respects, in good operating condition
and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. The Company and its subsidiaries are
in possession of and have good title to, or valid leasehold interests in or
valid rights under contract to use, the Tangible Personal Property material to
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens.

               (y)  Investment Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is an investment company required to be registered as an investment
company pursuant to the Investment Company Act.

               any other persons acting on their behalf has, in connection with
               the operation of their respective businesses, (A) used any
               corporate or other funds for unlawful contributions, payments,

               relating to political activity to government officials,
               candidates or members of political parties or organizations, or
               established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded funds in
               violation of Section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or
               any other similar applicable foreign, federal or state law, (B)

               violations or lack of compliance which would not have a material
               adverse effect on the Company.

                    (ii)   Each of the Company and the subsidiaries maintains
               accurate books and records reflecting its assets and liabilities
               and maintains proper and adequate internal accounting controls

               accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
               effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. The
               Company heretofore has provided to Parent complete and correct

               statements made in such certificates.

               (bb) Suppliers and Customers.

                    (i) Neither the Company nor any subsidiary has received any
               notice or has any reason to believe that any significant supplier

<PAGE>

                  supplies, merchandise and other goods to the Company or any
                  subsidiary at any time after the Effective Time on terms and
                  conditions substantially similar to those used in its current
                  sales to the Company and the subsidiaries, subject only to
                  general and customary price increases, unless comparable raw
                  materials, supplies, merchandise or other goods are readily
                  available from other sources on comparable terms and
                  conditions.

                           (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries

                  significant customer has expressed any intention to suspend,
                  terminate, materially limit, reduce, change or otherwise
                  modify its business relations with the Company or any of its
                  subsidiaries (including, without limitation, giving notice of
                  any intention to suspend, terminate, materially limit, reduce
                  or otherwise modify the volume of any purchases or orders from
                  the Company).

set forth in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
subsidiaries at December 28, 2002 (the "Unaudited Company Balance Sheet"), all

reflected in the Unaudited Company Balance Sheet have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and were not subject to any material discount, vendor margin
agreements, "high/low" holdbacks, contingency, "make whole," chargebacks,
writeoffs, writedowns, "make good", guaranty, return, allowance, claim of offset

practice and are substantially adequate to provide for all losses which may be
sustained on realization of the accounts receivable shown on the Unaudited
Company Balance Sheet. The inventories shown on the Unaudited Company Balance
Sheet consisted in all material respects of items of a quantity and quality
usable or saleable in the ordinary course of business. All of such inventories
were acquired in the ordinary course of business and have been replenished in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
custom and practice.

Agreement to which exception is being taken or as set forth in the Parent's

reference thereto shall be made in the Parent Disclosure Schedule), Parent
hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

                  (a)    Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

                         (i)  Each of Parent, its subsidiaries and Merger Sub
                  is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
                  existing and in good standing under the laws of the
                  jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite
                  corporate or other power, as the case may be, and requisite
                  authority to carry on its business as presently being
                  conducted. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly
                  qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
                  in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
                  the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
                  such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
                  jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
                  or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate
                  would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
                  effect on Parent or the applicable subsidiary.

                         (ii) Merger Sub is a newly formed corporation with no
                  material assets or liabilities, except for liabilities arising
                  under this Agreement. Merger Sub will not conduct any business
                  or activities other than the issuance of its capital stock to
                  Parent prior to the Merger.

                  (b)  Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value (the "Parent

which approximately 1,488,634 shares are subject to outstanding employee stock
options or other rights to purchase or receive Parent Common Stock granted under
the Parent Stock Plans (collectively, "Parent Employee Stock Options"); and (v)
no shares of Parent Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to
convertible securities. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent are,
and all shares thereof which may be issued pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise will be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive or any similar rights. Except as set
forth in this Section 3.2(b) and except for changes since January 30, 2003
resulting from the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Parent Stock Plans or Parent Employee Stock Options and other rights referred to
in this Section 3.2(b), as of the date hereof, (x) there are not issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or voting
securities or other ownership interests of Parent, (B) any securities of Parent
or any Parent subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
shares of capital stock or voting securities or other ownership interests of
Parent, (C) any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent
or any Parent subsidiary, and any obligation of Parent or any Parent subsidiary
to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting securities or other
ownership interests of

                                       39

Parent, and (y) there are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any Parent
subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities. There are no outstanding (A) securities of Parent or any Parent
subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or other ownership interests in any Parent
subsidiary, (B) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent
or any Parent subsidiary, and any obligation of Parent or any Parent subsidiary
to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests in, any Parent
subsidiary or (C) obligations of Parent or any Parent subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any such outstanding securities of Parent
subsidiaries or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, any such securities. Except for the Voting Agreement, there are no voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Parent or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or, to the knowledge of Parent, any Major Shareholder is
a party, with respect to the voting of the capital stock of Parent or any of the
subsidiaries.

               (c) Authority; Noncontravention. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and, subject, in the case of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
Merger, to the Parent Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,
subject, in the case of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger,
to the Parent Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except that
(i) such enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and (ii) the availability of the remedy
of specific performance or injunction or other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and could be subject to the discretion of the
courts for which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

               The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation, forfeiture or termination of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of forfeiture,
termination, cancellation or acceleration (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) of any obligation or loss of a benefit or, in the case of clause
(iii) below, any material obligation or loss of a material benefit, under, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries under, (i) the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Parent, (ii) the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the comparable organizational documents of any of its significant
subsidiaries or Merger Sub, (iii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,

<PAGE>

subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the
following sentence, any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (iv), any
such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually
or in the aggregate would not (x) reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Parent or (y) reasonably be expected to materially impair or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

               No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by, or in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity
is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a pre-merger
notification and report form by Parent under the HSR Act; (2) the filings with
the SEC of (A) the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement and (B) such reports
under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (3) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary and such filings with Governmental
Entities to satisfy the applicable requirements of the laws of states in which

filed (giving effect for this purpose to permissible extensions pursuant to Rule
12b-25 under the Exchange Act, to the extent the filing deadline as so extended
was satisfied) all reports, schedules, forms, information statements and other
documents (including exhibits) required to be filed by Parent with the SEC
(together with all certifications required pursuant to SOXA, the "Parent SEC
Documents"). As of their respective filing dates, (i) the Parent SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and (ii) no Parent SEC
Documents, as of their respective dates, except as amended or supplemented by a
subsequently filed Parent SEC Document, contained, and no Parent SEC Document
filed subsequent to the date hereof will contain as of their respective dates,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, and no Parent SEC Document
filed subsequent to the date hereof will omit as of their respective dates, to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of registration statements of the Parent under

               such applicable laws.

                     (iv)  As of the date of this Agreement, no Federal, state,
               local or foreign audits or other administrative proceedings or
               court proceedings are presently pending with regard to any Taxes

               against, or with respect to, the Parent or any of its
               subsidiaries. There is no action, suit or audit now in progress,
               pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
               with respect to the Parent or any of its subsidiaries with

                     (vii)  No claim has been made in writing by any
               Governmental Entities in a jurisdiction where the Parent or any

                     (ix)   Neither the Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
               received any notice of deficiency or assessment from any
               Governmental Entity for any amount of Tax that has not been fully
               settled or satisfied, and to the knowledge of the Parent and its
               subsidiaries no such deficiency or assessment is proposed.

such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; (iii) any suspension, termination, limitation,
modification, change or other alteration of any agreement, arrangement, business

adverse effect on such party or on the accuracy and completeness of its

conditions set forth in Article VI; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement; and

                                       51

<PAGE>

provided further that a failure to comply with this Section 4.2 shall not
constitute a failure to be satisfied of any condition set forth in Article VI
unless the underlying untruth, inaccuracy, failure to comply or satisfy, or
change or event would independently result in a failure of a condition set forth
in Article VI to be satisfied.

               SECTION 4.3 No Solicitation by the Company. (a) Until the earlier
          of the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement,
          neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any of the officers
          or directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall, and the
          Company shall instruct and use its best efforts to cause its and its
          subsidiaries' agents, employees, representatives and affiliates
          (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
          it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
          solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
          information), or take any other action designed to facilitate any
          inquiries or expressions of interest regarding, or the making of any
          offer or proposal which reasonably could be expected to lead to, the
          receipt or submission of a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate
          in any discussions or provide any confidential or material non-public
          information, data or assistance to any person relating to any Company
          Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
          Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) make or authorize any statement,
          recommendation or solicitation in support of or expressing neutrality
          in respect of any Company Takeover Proposal or (v) grant any waiver or
          release under any "standstill" or similar agreement; provided,
          however, that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
          permitted to (A) engage in discussions with any person who seeks
          (without any solicitation by or discussion with the Company or its
          directors, officers, Employees, advisors, agents or representatives in
          violation of this Section 4.3) to initiate discussions relating to a
          Company Takeover Proposal, or (B) subject to receipt by the Company of
          an executed confidentiality agreement from such person containing
          customary terms for and conditions relative to transactions of such
          nature (and otherwise having terms no more favorable to such person
          than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreements), furnish such
          person information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries, if and
          only to the extent that prior to furnishing any such information to,
          or entering into discussions with, any such person, (1) the Board of
          Directors of the Company determines in its good faith, after
          consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in
          such discussions or provide such information would violate the
          fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors to the Company's
          stockholders under applicable law, (2) the Company's Board of
          Directors concludes in its good faith, after consultation with its
          outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor (or an
          independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation),
          that there is a substantial likelihood that such actions would lead
          reasonably promptly to the receipt or submission of a Company Superior
          Proposal and (3) the Company provides prior written notice to Parent
          of its intention to take such action. Upon the execution of this
          Agreement, the Company, its subsidiaries and their representatives
          immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing
          activities, discussions, inquiries, investigations or negotiations
          with all parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
          directors, officers, agents, representatives and advisors) with
          respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or proposed transaction which
          could lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company hereby confirms
          that it has consulted with and fully informed its and its
          subsidiaries' officers, directors, agents, representatives and
          affiliates as to the meaning and provisions of this Section 4.3, and
          that such persons have confirmed their understanding of and have
          agreed to comply with the provisions hereof.

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, expression of interest, term sheet, letter of intent, proposal or offer
from any person relating to any (i) acquisition, purchase, lease, exchange,
sale, joint venture, or mortgage (in a single transaction or series of related
transactions) of 10% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, (ii) offer, sale, issuance or purchase (in a single transaction or
series of related transactions) of any Equity Securities (as defined in Section
3(a)(11) of the Exchange Act) or voting debt securities of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, (iii) tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would
result in any person acquiring beneficial ownership of any Equity Securities or
voting debt securities of the Company, (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, reincorporation or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, (v) the declaration or payment by the Company of an
extraordinary dividend or distribution in respect of any of its Equity
Securities or the effectuation by the Company of a transaction that would
involve either a change in or reconstitution of the Company's outstanding
capital stock or a distribution of assets of any kind to the holders thereof,
(vi) repurchase by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of shares of the
Company's capital stock or voting debt securities, or (vii) public announcement
by the Company or any other person of a proposal, plan or intention to pursue,
enter into or consummate any of the foregoing (other than the Merger).

     For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any
unsolicited bona-fide, written proposal or offer (setting forth all relevant
material terms and conditions, including, without limitation, price and
structure, and to the extent then known, intended Tax and accounting treatment,
conditions to consummation, a description of all requisite third party and
regulatory approvals, and the intentions of the person making the proposal or
offer with respect to the provisions of this Section 4.3 and Section 5.8(b))
made by any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or an affiliate thereof) to
acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, reincorporation, or other similar transaction (including any
change-in-control of the type contemplated by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange
Act), 100% of the combined voting power of the Company's capital stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with and upon the advice of outside legal counsel and
the Company Financial Advisor (or an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation), would be more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Merger and otherwise fair to and in the best interests of the
holders of Company Common Stock and advisable (after due consideration of the
transaction value and price and form of consideration, the likelihood and
anticipated timing of consummation, all regulatory approval requirements and
consequences, and all other legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal) and, in respect of which, cash (sufficient in amount to pay the
aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock to
the extent such consideration is to be paid in cash, all transaction fees and
expenses and the fee payable under Section 5.8(b) hereof) is either then
available and segregated or fully committed and not subject to any contingency
(except for customary commercial senior lender "market outs").

          (b)  Except as expressly permitted by the third paragraph of this
Section 4.3(b), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in any manner

                                       53

<PAGE>

adverse to Parent, the approval or adoption of the Agreement, the Merger or the
Company Recommendation or take any action or make any statement in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such approval, adoption
or Company Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company
Recommendation"), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement-in-principle,
memorandum of understanding, heads of agreement, term sheet, agreement,
contract, commitment, plan or arrangement (each, a "Company Acquisition
Agreement") related to any Company Takeover Proposal.

          For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Recommendation
shall include any approval or recommendation (or publicly announced proposal to
approve or recommend), by the Company's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof of a Company Takeover Proposal, or any failure by the Company's Board of
Directors to recommend against a Company Takeover Proposal.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in response to a Company Acquisition
Proposal from any person which is unsolicited and not otherwise made, submitted
or received in violation of this Section 4.3, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in its good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and the Company Financial Advisor (or an independent financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation), that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, subject to payment of the fee required
to be paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section 5.8(b), the Board of
Directors of the Company may, (A) at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, effect a Change in the Company Recommendation or, (B) at any time after
the Company Stockholders Meeting, terminate this Agreement and enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that at least seven business days prior to taking any of the
actions set forth in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company's Board of Directors
theretofore shall have provided Parent written notice advising Parent that the
Company's Board of Directors is prepared to conclude that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and during such seven-business
day period the Company and its agents, representatives and advisors shall have
negotiated diligently and in good faith with Parent to make adjustments to
and/or amendments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Company Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal
and after fully considering any such adjustment or amendment the Company's Board
of Directors concludes in its good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its independent financial advisor, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; it being hereby intended and
agreed that the Company shall not enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Company Superior Proposal (or propose publicly to do so)
prior to the expiration of such seven-business day period.

          (c)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.3, the Company shall advise Parent
orally and within 24 hours in writing of any request for information relating to
a Company Takeover Proposal, or of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request or Company Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal, and
shall promptly provide a copy of any written request or Company Takeover
Proposal to Parent,

                                       54

<PAGE>

and any information and/or documents provided by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal to
the extent not previously furnished to Parent. The Company will keep Parent
promptly informed, on a current basis and in reasonable detail, of the status
and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Company Takeover Proposal.

          (d)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
l4e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure if the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to make such disclosure would
violate its obligations under applicable law; provided, however, any such
disclosure relating to a Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Change in the Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the
Company publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

     SECTION 4.4 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to: (i) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time
within which to file) all Tax Returns ("Post-Signing Returns") required to be
filed by it and such Post-Signing Returns shall be prepared in a manner
reasonably consistent with past practice; (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown as due
and payable on such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed; (iii) make provision
in its books and records and financial statements in accordance with past
practice for all Taxes payable by it for which no Post-Signing Return is due
prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) promptly notify Parent of any material
suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or with
respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter,
including (without limitation) Tax liabilities and refund claims.

     SECTION 4.5 Transition. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers and employees to, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to facilitate the integration of the Company and its subsidiaries with the
businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries to be effective as of the Closing

          (i);

               (ii)  enter into any agreement to acquire all or substantially
          all of the capital stock or assets of any other person or business

Stockholders Meetings.

          (a)  As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC (and the Company shall cooperate and
participate in the preparation of) the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement shall be included as a prospectus and in which a resale prospectus
(the "Resale Prospectus") shall be included for the purpose of permitting the
Parent Common Stock issued to those affiliates of the Company identified in
Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to be resold by such affiliates
as provided in the last sentence of this Section 5.1(a). Each of Parent and the
Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 and the
Resale Prospectus declared effective under the Securities Act and the Joint
Proxy Statement "cleared" by the SEC's staff for mailing in connection with the
Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
practicable after such filing. As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective, each of Parent and the Company shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the Resale Prospectus in effect for purposes
of the Securities Act until the earlier of (i) such time as those affiliates
identified on Schedule 5.10 have resold their Parent Common Stock covered by
such Resale Prospectus or (ii) 365 days after the effective date of the Resale
Prospectus.

          (b)  If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i)
any event with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with

<PAGE>

supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement
or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
in either case, which event is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, such event promptly
shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
Company and Parent.

          (c)  Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate
government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other
appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any of the
filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information, and shall supply the other
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. The Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the
SEC with respect to the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with each other and provide to each other all information necessary to prepare
the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement, and shall provide promptly to the
other party all information such party may obtain that could necessitate
amending any such document.

is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the DGCL,
its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as applicable, for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to Section 4.3(b), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the Company's stockholders
that they affirmatively vote for the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company
Recommendation"). The Company shall solicit from the holders of Company Common
Stock proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other
lawful action necessary and desirable to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been duly called and
noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for the absence
of a quorum, and then only to the nearest possible future date) the Company
Stockholders Meeting without Parent's written consent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 5.1(d) shall not be affected by the making,
commencement, public announcement, public disclosure, submission, receipt or
communication to the Company or its stockholders or professional advisors or
representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding any Change in
the Company Recommendation or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
such obligation. The Company shall coordinate and cooperate with Parent with
respect to the timing of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholder Meeting, and shall take all steps necessary to ensure that they are
convened and held on the same date or as nearly proximate to one another as
reasonably practicable.

that no State Takeover Laws is or becomes applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or

     SECTION 5.6 [Intentionally Omitted]

     SECTION 5.7 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational instruments and agreements) and any existing indemnification
agreements or arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
five years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time.

          (b)  In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such

                                       59

<PAGE>

claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is
now or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a
party, or arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or current employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.

          (c)  For a period of three years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by
the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to such scope of coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company's
directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of Parent or its subsidiaries
(including self-insurance) containing terms with respect to scope of coverage
and amount no less favorable to such directors or officers; and provided,
further, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay
aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 5.7(c) in excess of 275% of
the aggregate premiums paid by the Company during its fiscal year ended December
28, 2002 on an annualized basis for such purpose and, if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest scope of coverage and amount that is then
available for a cost not exceeding 275% of such premium amount.

          (d)  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any successor
thereto, whether by consolidation, merger or transfer of substantially all of
its properties or assets, to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.7.
The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party and other person named herein and his or her heirs and representatives.

     SECTION 5.8 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in this Section 5.8
or in Section 5.14, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement (including all instruments and agreements prepared and
delivered in connection herewith), and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated.

          (b)  (i)   If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
          Section 7.1(c)(ii), then upon such termination the Company shall pay
          (or cause to be paid) to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to
          an account designated in writing by Parent to the Company, a fee of
          $3,680,000.

               (ii)  (A) If (x) a Pre-Termination Company Takeover Proposal
          Event shall occur and thereafter this Agreement is terminated either
          by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) and (y) prior
          to the first anniversary of the date of such termination the Company
          consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or enters into or publicly
          announces a Company Acquisition Agreement,

                                       60

<PAGE>

          then on the earliest to occur of the date such Company Takeover
          Proposal is consummated or such Company Acquisition Agreement is
          entered into or publicly announced, the Company shall pay (or cause to
          be paid) to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
          designated in writing by Parent to the Company, a fee of $3,680,000
          (less the amount, if any, theretofore paid to Parent under Section
          5.8(b)(ii)(B)).

                     (B)  If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
          the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) without there having
          occurred a Pre-Termination Company Takeover Proposal Event, then the
          Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent by wire transfer of
          same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent to the
          Company, a fee of $1,840,000, not later than the second business day
          next following such termination.

               (iii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
          Section 7.1(d), then upon such termination the Company shall pay (or
          cause to be paid) to Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds to an
          account designated in writing by Parent to the Company, a fee of
          $3,680,000.

               (iv)  For purposes of this Section 5.8(b), a "Pre-Termination
          Company Takeover Proposal Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to
          the event giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement and, in
          all cases, subject to the requirements and obligations of the Company
          set forth in Sections 4.3 and 5.1, a Company Takeover Proposal shall
          have been made known to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or made
          directly to the Company's stockholders generally or any person shall
          have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
          make a Company Takeover Proposal, and such Company Takeover Proposal
          or public announcement shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn at
          least seven business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

               (v)   The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
          this Section 5.8(b) are an integral part of the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement and that without these agreements
          Parent would not have been induced to enter into this Agreement.
          Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amounts due pursuant to
          this Section 5.8(b), and, to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
          suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set
          forth in this Section 5.8(b), the Company shall pay to Parent all of
          its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
          connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
          fee at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis
          points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

               (vi)  It is expressly agreed that the amounts to be paid pursuant
          to this Section 5.8(b) constitute liquidated damages negotiated at
          arm's-length and do not constitute, and are not intended by the
          parties to operate as, a penalty, and any such amounts paid shall
          constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the party

                                       61

<PAGE>

                  receiving such payment under the events and circumstances
                  giving rise thereto as specified in this Agreement, except
                  that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability
                  (in contract, tort or otherwise, and whether pursuant to an
                  action at law or in equity) for any knowing or willful breach
                  by a party of any of its representations, warranties,
                  covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or in
                  respect of fraud by any party.

         SECTION 5.9 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and shall provide each other the opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with and use reasonable efforts to agree on, any
press release or other public statements or announcements (including pursuant to
Rule 165 under the Securities Act and Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act) and
any broadly distributed internal communications with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement or announcement
prior to such consultation, except as either party may determine is required by
applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system
of a registered national securities association (provided prior notice is given
to the other party with a copy of any such disclosure) and except for any
discussions with rating agencies. The parties agree that the initial press
releases (or joint press release if the parties so determine) to be issued with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

         SECTION 5.10 Affiliates. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent not later than 30 days after the date
hereof a written agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A of all persons who are (or may deemed to be) "affiliates" of the Company for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (and who are identified in Section
5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). Any such affiliate that shall not
so execute and deliver to the Company such written agreement as provided in this
Section 5.10 shall not be entitled to have the Parent Stock Consideration issued
in the Merger to such affiliate covered by (and shall not be entitled to be
included as a "selling stockholder" in) the Resale Prospectus. Promptly after
the expiration of such 30-day period, the Company shall cause to be delivered to
each affiliate that shall not so execute such written agreement as provided in
this Section 5.10 a statement disclosing that the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to such affiliate are subject to transfer
restrictions under each of Rule 145 and Rule 144 under the Securities Act and,
therefore, may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except pursuant
to an effective registration statement under, or in accordance with an available
exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of, the
Securities Act, and that the certificates evidencing such shares of Parent
Common Stock shall bear appropriate restrictive legends and stop transfer orders
shall be maintained by the Parent's transfer agent in respect of such shares.

         SECTION 5.11 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock issuable under Article II to be
qualified for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event prior to the
Closing Date.

                                       62

         SECTION 5.12 Stockholder Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or Parent, as applicable, and its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 5.13 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements. During
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the
Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
subsidiaries is a party and which relates to the confidentiality or information
regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or which relate to securities of the
Company. During such period, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions
of any such agreement, including by using its reasonable best efforts to obtain
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 5.14 Conveyance Taxes. The Company has no interest in real
estate, including, without limitation, any leasehold interest, except as set
forth in Section 3.1(w)(i)(A) and Section 3.1(w)(i)(B) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and the Company and Parent agree that if Parent determines, in its
sole discretion, that a calculation of the fair market value of such real estate
interest is necessary for the preparation and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer, real property transfer gains or similar Taxes, the Company shall
obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of such real estate interest as
promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer, real property transfer
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time, and each party further agrees to take such reporting positions and other
action as reasonably required to effectuate the intention and purposes of this
Section 5.14. The Company shall pay on behalf of its stockholders any such Taxes
or fees imposed by any Governmental Entity which become payable in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which such stockholders
are primarily liable and in no event shall Parent pay such amounts.

         SECTION 5.15 Employee Benefits. (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) give those Employees who are,
as of the Effective Time, employed by the Company and its subsidiaries (the
"Continuing Employees") full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accruals (other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for such Continuing Employees' service with the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company (or any predecessor entity) to the same
extent recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees under any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to

consents, approvals and actions of, filings with and notices to any Governmental
Entity required by the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries under

business of the Company in substantially the same manner as presently conducted,
shall have been obtained or made (all such approvals and the expiration of all
such waiting periods, the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals")

                (c)   No Injunctions or Restraints. No judgment, order,
restraining order and/or injunction (temporary or otherwise), decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or

materially delaying the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that each
of the parties shall have used its best efforts to have such Restraint lifted,
vacated or rescinded; and provided,

<PAGE>

further that if such Restraint is not lifted, vacated or rescinded (and all

in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as
of such date); provided that no representation or warranty of the Company shall
be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of this Section 6.2(a) as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance inconsistent
with such representation or warranty, unless such fact, event or circumstance,
individually or when aggregated with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty of the Company, has had or
would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the Company,
disregarding for these purposes any qualification or exception for, or reference
to, materiality in any such representation or warranty. Parent shall have
received a certificate of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to the foregoing effect.

reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions

     SECTION 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) and the
Confidentiality Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except for
the provisions of Section 5.7 which shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the persons referred to therein, are not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

     SECTION 8.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal substantive and procedural laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of law of such state.

     SECTION 8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, provided, however, that Parent may
assign Merger Sub's rights and obligations, in whole or in part, under this
Agreement to Parent or any other, wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Parent. Any
assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the
preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

     SECTION 8.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a)

personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court,

venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any Federal court located in
the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     SECTION 8.10 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It

the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other

                            Form of Affiliate Letter

February __, 2003

Perry Ellis International, Inc.
3000 NW 107th Avenue
Miami, Florida 33172
Attention: Corporate General Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The undersigned has been advised that it may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Salant Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") (as
that term is defined in Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act")). The undersigned understands that upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 3,
2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Perry Ellis International, Inc., a
Florida corporation ("Parent"), Connor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger and, as such, continue its corporate
existence as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

         The undersigned further understands that in the Merger, in exchange for
shares of its common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Merger Agreement, and/or in exchange
for its Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement,
as applicable, it may receive shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock"), and that it may be deemed to have been an "affiliate"
(as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company at
the time the Merger was submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the
Company Stockholders Meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and that
the sale, transfer or other disposition by the undersigned of the Parent Common
Stock shall not be registered under the Securities Act, except to the extent
contemplated by Section 5.1(a) of the Merger Agreement (but subject to Section
5.10 of the Merger Agreement).

         The undersigned has read this letter carefully and discussed the
requirements hereof to the extent necessary with its counsel or with counsel for
the Company. The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants with and to
Parent that if it receives any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Merger Agreement and/or in exchange for
Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement:

                  1. It shall not effect any sale, transfer, or other
disposition of such Parent Common Stock (or any rights thereto or interests
therein) (except to Parent) unless and until: (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered pursuant to a registration statement which has
been declared effective by order of the SEC under the Securities Act (which
condition shall be satisfied as contemplated by Section 5.1(a) of the Merger
Agreement but subject to Section 5.10 of the Merger Agreement), (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with Rules 144 and 145 under
the Securities Act (as such rules may be amended from time to time), (iii) in
the opinion of

                                      A-1

<PAGE>

counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or under a
"no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC addressed to
the undersigned, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or
otherwise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, or (iv) it has
the right to have the legend set forth in Sections 3 and 4 below removed solely
as provided in Section 4 below.

                  2. It understands that only to the extent provided in Section
5.1(a) of the Merger Agreement (but subject to Section 5.10 thereof), Parent is
under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of
Parent Common Stock by the undersigned or on its behalf under the Securities Act
or, other than as set forth below, to take any other action necessary to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

                  3. It understands that stop transfer instructions have been or
will be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock
issued to the undersigned in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and/or
Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement and that there will be placed on the
certificates, if any, for such shares (or any substitutions therefor) a legend
stating in substance:

                  "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a
                  transaction to which Rules 145 and 144, respectively, under
                  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, apply. The shares
                  represented by this certificate may be sold, transferred or
                  otherwise disposed of only in accordance with the terms of a
                  certain letter agreement between the registered holder hereof
                  and Perry Ellis International, Inc., a copy of which agreement
                  is on file at the principal offices of Perry Ellis
                  International, Inc"

                  4. It understands that unless (i) the sale, transfer or other
disposition by the undersigned of the Parent Common Stock issued to it pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) and/or Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement has been registered
in a registration statement which is declared effective by order of the SEC
under the Securities Act (which is contemplated by Section 5.1(a) of the Merger
Agreement but subject to Section 5.10 of the Merger Agreement) and such shares
have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the plan
of distribution contemplated by and described in the final prospectus
constituting part of such effective registration statement, or (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with the provisions of Rule
145(d) under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates, if any,
issued to the undersigned's transferee:

                  "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
                  registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
                  "Securities Act"), and were acquired from a person who
                  received such shares in a transaction to which Rules 145 and
                  144 under the Securities Act apply. Accordingly, neither the
                  shares represented by this certificate nor any right thereto
                  or interests therein may be sold, transferred or otherwise
                  disposed of except (i) pursuant to an appropriate registration
                  statement which is declared effective by order of the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
                  and pursuant to applicable state securities laws, (ii) in
                  compliance with the Rules 144 and 145, respectively, under the
                  Securities Act (as such rules may be amended from time to
                  time), or (iii)

                                      A-2

<PAGE>

                  if, in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
                  satisfactory to Parent, or under a "no-action" letter or
                  interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC addressed to the
                  holder/owner of the shares represented by this certificate,
                  registration under the Securities Act of any sale, transfer or
                  disposition of the shares represented by this certificate is
                  not required by reason of the availability of and compliance
                  with an applicable exemption from such registration."

         It is hereby understood and agreed that the legends set forth in
paragraphs (3) and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be
lifted only if the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a
"no-action" letter or interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC addressed
to the undersigned, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for
purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) a written statement from the undersigned
representing that that the Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates
have been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) and Rule 144, as
applicable (together with a copy of an opinion of counsel addressed to the
Parent's transfer agent) or pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, which shall be as contemplated by Sections 5.1(a) and
5.10 of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if the shares of Parent
Common Stock are disposed of in accordance with the Resale Prospectus
contemplated by Sections 5.1(a) and 5.10 of the Merger Agreement, the conditions
of clause (i) of the immediately preceding paragraph (as well as clause (i) of
Section 1 hereof and clause (i) of Section 4 hereof) shall be deemed satisfied.

agrees that, except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement,
the Stockholder (a) has not entered, and shall not enter at any time while this
Agreement remains in effect, into any voting agreement or voting trust with

directly or indirectly offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for sale,

imposed on Stockholders hereby.

         ARTICLE II REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EACH STOCKHOLDER

If such Stockholder is married and any of such Stockholder's Shares constitute
community property under applicable laws, this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and

fiduciary capacity, the individual or entity signing this Agreement has the full
power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement

     2.2 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by such
Stockholder of this Agreement do not and will not result in any breach or
violation of or be in conflict with or constitute a default under any term of
any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree, law, regulation or
arrangement to which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholder
(or any of its assets) is bound, except for any such breach, violation, conflict
or default which, individually or in the aggregate, would not impair or affect
such Stockholder's ability to perform such Stockholder's obligations hereunder.

from the date hereof through and on the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting
will be, owned beneficially by such Stockholder. As of the date hereof, such

Stock owned of record or beneficially by such Stockholder. Such Stockholder has
or will have the voting power, power of disposition, power to issue instructions
with respect to the matter set forth in Section 1.1 hereof, and power to agree
to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to
all of such Stockholder's Existing Shares and with respect to all of such
Stockholder's Shares on the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, with no
limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject to
applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this Agreement.

by Target, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each Stockholder, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Target, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such

laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equity
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

     3.3 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by Target of
this Agreement do not and will not result in any breach or violation of or be in
conflict

     injunction, order, decree, law, regulation or arrangement to which Target
     is a party or by which Target (or any of its assets) is bound, except for
     any such breach, violation, conflict or default which, individually or in
     the aggregate, would not impair or affect Target's ability to perform its
     obligations hereunder.

                         ARTICLE IV GENERAL PROVISIONS

     4.1  Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and no party shall have

     4.3  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures transmitted by facsimile
or other comparable means shall be deemed an original.

     4.4  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida (without giving effect to
choice of law principles thereof).

     4.5  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

     4.6  Assignment. Except as expressly provided in Section 1.4 hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by
operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of all of the
parties hereto. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall be
void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns (including, in the case of an individual, any
executors, administrators, estates or legal representatives of such individual).

     4.7  Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the
State of Florida or any Florida state court in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other

                                      B-5

request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than a Federal court sitting in the State of
Florida or a Florida state court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any Federal court located in the State of Florida or any Florida
state court, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     4.8  Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

     4.9  Amendments. This Agreement may not be modified or amended, except upon
the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties
hereto.

     4.10  Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term
"beneficial ownership" (or any similar term) shall have the meaning set forth in
Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (ii) the term "Merger
Agreement" shall include the Merger Agreement as amended from time to time.

     4.11  Action in Stockholder Capacity Only. Each representation, warranty,
covenant and agreement made by a Stockholder hereunder is made in such
Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder only, not as an officer or director of
Parent. Nothing herein shall limit or affect any Stockholder's ability to take
any action in his or her capacity as an officer or director of Parent.
