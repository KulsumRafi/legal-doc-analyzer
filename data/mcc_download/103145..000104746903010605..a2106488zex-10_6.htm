<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Consolidated

addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Quick Ratio, if, as of the date of determination, Consolidated EBITDA less Consolidated Net Unfunded Capital Expenditures on a rolling
four-quarters basis is less than $20,000,000, then accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis shall be excluded from Consolidated Quick Assets to the
extent such accounts receivable exceed 50% of Consolidated Quick Assets." </FONT></P>

the aggregate Permitted Acquisition Purchase Price (excluding consideration consisting of the Company's common stock) paid in connection with any single Permitted Acquisition, or in connection
with all Permitted Acquisitions, collectively, shall not exceed $100,000,000 from February&nbsp;7, 2003 through the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination Date, provided, that, the Permitted
Acquisition Purchase Price shall not exceed $15,000,000 if the business which is the subject of such Permitted Acquisition has a negative Consolidated EBITDA or if Consolidated EBITDA cannot be
reasonably determined by the Company or such Person;" </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"The
Unused Fee Rate will be set or reset quarterly on the first Business Day of the fiscal quarter of the Company that commences after the date on which the financial statements referred to in
Section&nbsp;6.03(a) or
Section&nbsp;6.03(b) hereof, as the case may be, are required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, and shall be used to calculate the commitment fee as described in Section&nbsp;3.04
hereof on or after such date until, but not including, the next date on which the Unused Fee Rate is reset in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided, however, that if any financial statements
are not received by the Administrative Agent within the time period relating to such financial statements as provided in Section&nbsp;6.03(a) or Section&nbsp;6.03(b) hereof, as the case may be,
the Unused Fee Rate used to calculate the commitment fee as described in Section&nbsp;3.04 hereof on or after the date the Unused Fee Rate should have been reset in accordance with the foregoing
provisions (i.e. assuming timely delivery of the requisite financial statements), until the day which is the first Business Day of the fiscal quarter of the Company which commences following the
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such financial statements will be set based on a ratio of greater than 2.00:1.00; and further provided, however, that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall not in any way be deemed to have waived any Event of Default or any of their remedies hereunder (including, without limitation, remedies provided in Article&nbsp;VIII hereof) in connection
with the provisions of the foregoing proviso. During the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, no downward adjustment, and only upward adjustments, shall be made to the Unused Fee Rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that Consolidated EBITDA less Consolidated Net Unfunded Capital Expenditures on a rolling four quarters basis is less than $20,000,000, the Unused Fee Rate
shall be immediately reset to 0.375%." </FONT></P>
