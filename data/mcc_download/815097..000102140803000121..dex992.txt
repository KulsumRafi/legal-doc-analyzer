               4.1.7 Satisfaction of Closing Conditions. Neither Party shall
take any action or omit to take any action for the purpose of preventing,
delaying or impeding the consummation of the Transactions; and

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

               4.1.8 No Related Actions. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall authorize or enter into an agreement to do any of the foregoing.

         4.2   Acquisition Proposals.

               4.2.1 No Shop. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess agrees that,
subject to Section 4.2.3 and except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers or directors of
it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives (collectively, with respect to each of Carnival and P&O
Princess, such Person's "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer by a third party with respect to a merger, takeover,
reorganization, share exchange, scheme of arrangement, dual-holding company
transaction, consolidation or similar transaction involving Carnival or P&O
Princess, or any purchase of or joint venture (or similar arrangement)
involving, or offer to purchase or enter into a joint venture (or similar
arrangement) involving, all or 15% or more of the equity securities of Carnival
or P&O Princess, as the case may be, or of its and its Subsidiaries' assets
taken as a whole (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"). Each of Carnival and P&O Princess further agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or its Subsidiaries'
officers or directors shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, have
any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or engage in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either Carnival or P&O
Princess or its board of directors from (i) negotiating with or furnishing
information to any Person who has made a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of this Section 4.2.1
(or any action that would have constituted such a breach if the Representatives
of such Party were bound by this Section to the same extent as such Party) or
Section 6 of, or any comparable no-shop provision in, the Stockholders Deed
Polls (or any action that would have constituted a breach if the Representatives
(as defined in the Stockholders Deed Polls) were bound by such Section to the
same extent as the Carnival Major Stockholders) (each, a "Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal") or (ii) recommending a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders, if and only to the extent that, in each case, the board of
directors of such Party determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors and such Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means in respect of Carnival or P&O Princess, as applicable, any
Qualifying Acquisition Proposal by a third party (x) on terms which the board of
directors of such Party determines in its good faith judgment to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the
Transactions after consultation with its financial advisors (which advice shall
be communicated to the other Party) and after giving the

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

other Party at least ten Business Days to respond to such third party Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal, (y) which the board of directors of such Party determines
in its good faith judgment to constitute a transaction that is reasonably likely
to be consummated on the terms set forth, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and (z) which relates
to at least a majority of the consolidated assets by value or the securities by
voting power of such Party. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess agrees that it
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess also agrees that if
it has not already done so, it will promptly request each Person, if any, that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior
to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

               4.2.2 Notifications. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess agrees
that it will take the necessary steps promptly to inform its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 4.2. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess agrees that it will notify the
other promptly if any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to or constituting
an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any information is requested from, or
any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries'
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep the other informed, on a current basis, of the status and
material terms of any such proposals or offers, including providing the other
Party with copies of any information provided to such other Person.

               4.2.3 Compliance with Exchange Act, Exchange Regulations and City
Code. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit a Party from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by means of a tender or
exchange offer or taking such action and making such recommendations as its
board of directors shall determine, in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is required in order to comply with any obligations
imposed on it by the SEC, the NYSE, the City Code, the Takeover Panel, the
London Stock Exchange or the UKLA in relation to any Acquisition Proposal
(provided that it is hereby acknowledged, for the avoidance of doubt, that no
provision of the City Code requires P&O Princess or its directors to solicit or
initiate any Acquisition Proposal). If the SEC, the NYSE, the Takeover Panel,
UKLA or London Stock Exchange, as applicable, requests or directs a Party to
take any course of action in connection with, or which would have any effect on,
the Transactions, then such Party agrees, solely to the extent practicable
(having regard to the time available and the nature and urgency of such request
or direction), to (i) notify the other Party of this fact and (ii) consult with
the other Party prior to taking any action with respect to such request or
direction.

         4.3   Information Supplied.

               4.3.1 Shareholder Documents. Each of Carnival and P&O Princess
each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries that:

                     4.3.1.1 It shall provide such information for inclusion in
each of the Shareholder Documents, such that each Shareholder Document shall
contain all particulars relating to Carnival and P&O Princess required to comply
in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including the PGCL, the
Companies Act, the City Code and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(and the rules and regulations thereunder), the requirements of the London Stock
Exchange, the listing rules of the UKLA, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE;

                     4.3.1.2 The information provided by such Party for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the Shareholder Documents
shall not, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time or times of
the Carnival Shareholders Meeting or the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading in any material respect; and

                     4.3.1.3 If at any time prior to the Carnival Shareholders
Meeting or the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, any information
relating to Carnival or P&O Princess, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Carnival or P&O Princess which
should be set forth in a supplement to any of the Shareholder Documents, so that
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading in any material respect, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required by
Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly disseminated to the Carnival shareholders or the P&O Princess
shareholders, as applicable.

         4.4   Shareholders Meetings. Carnival and P&O Princess will each
respectively take all action necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of
Carnival Common Stock to obtain the Carnival Requisite Vote (the "Carnival
Shareholders Meeting") and the holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares to obtain
the P&O Princess Requisite Vote (the "P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting") to
approve the Transactions, as soon as possible after the date hereof, and the
Parties shall liaise to ensure that the Carnival Shareholders Meeting will be
held two days prior to the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting; provided that if
either Party elects to hold its meeting on an earlier date, it may do so;
provided, however, the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting may not be convened
prior to the 20th Business Day after commencement of the Offer. Subject to
fiduciary obligations and the requirements of applicable Law, the board of
directors of each of Carnival and P&O Princess shall recommend to its respective
shareholders the

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

approval of, in the case of Carnival, the Carnival Amendments and, in the case
of P&O Princess, the P&O Princess Amendments, and in each case, this Agreement
and the DLC Transactions, which recommendation shall be set forth in the
Carnival Circular and the P&O Princess EGM Circular, respectively, and shall
take all lawful action to solicit such approval. The Carnival Shareholders
Meeting and the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting will be held regardless of any
failure to make such recommendation or any change in such recommendation.

        4.5  Filings; Other Actions; Notification.

             4.5.1 Filings. As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, Carnival and P&O Princess shall prepare and make all necessary
filings and notifications to any Governmental Entity required to implement the
DLC Transactions, including the filing of the Shareholder Documents with the SEC
and UKLA, as appropriate. Carnival and P&O Princess shall cooperate to conform
the content of the Shareholder Documents, to the extent reasonably practicable
and appropriate. Carnival and P&O Princess each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statements declared effective by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after filing. P&O Princess and Carnival each shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the P&O Princess EGM Circular approved by
the UKLA as promptly as practicable after filing. Carnival and P&O Princess
shall each provide the other and its counsel with copies of any comments
Carnival or P&O Princess or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its Staff or
the UKLA, as applicable, with respect to the Shareholders Documents promptly
after the receipt of such comments, and Carnival and P&O Princess shall
cooperate (and shall cause their respective counsel to cooperate) reasonably in
responding promptly and appropriately to such comments. Carnival shall promptly
prepare and file a supplemental listing application with the NYSE with respect
to the shares of Carnival Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have such shares of Carnival Common Stock
approved for listing by the NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance,
and shall promptly prepare and file a listing application with the NYSE with
respect to the SVT Shares and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such
SVT Shares approved for listing by the NYSE, subject only to official notice of
issuance.

             4.5.2 Mailing of Documents. Carnival shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Carnival Circular to be mailed to its shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the SEC has declared the Second Joint Registration
Statement effective. P&O Princess shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the P&O Princess EGM Circular to its shareholders, and Carnival shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be mailed to the P&O
Princess shareholders as promptly as practicable after the SEC has declared the
Joint Registration Statement effective and UKLA has approved the P&O Princess
EGM Circular.

             4.5.3 Cooperation. Carnival and P&O Princess shall each cooperate
with the other and (i) use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) all their respective reasonable best efforts promptly to take or cause to
be taken all

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents, (ii) use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) all their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations required to be obtained from any third party (other than
Carnival Required Consents and P&O Princess Required Consents) necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, and (iii) use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Carnival Required Consents or P&O
Princess Required Consents, as the case may be; provided that neither Party
shall be required by this Section 4.5.3(ii) or (iii) to accept or agree to any
conditions, terms or restrictions in connection with any such Carnival Required
Consent or P&O Princess Required Consent, as the case may be, which,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on P&O Princess and/or Carnival after the Effective Time (it
being understood that, for this purpose, materiality shall be considered with
reference to the total equity market value of P&O Princess and Carnival as a
unified commercial enterprise). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Carnival and P&O Princess shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on,
all the information relating to Carnival and its Subsidiaries or P&O Princess
and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of Carnival and P&O Princess shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

             4.5.4 Furnishing Information. Carnival and P&O Princess each shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Shareholder Documents or any other necessary or appropriate filing, notice,
statement, registration, submission of information or application made by or on
behalf of Carnival or P&O Princess or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions.

             4.5.5 Status. Carnival and P&O Princess each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Carnival or P&O Princess, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions. Carnival and P&O Princess each shall give prompt
notice to the other of any change that is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on it or of any failure of any condition set forth in
Article V to the other Party's obligations to effect the Transactions.

             4.5.6 Consultation; Participation. Prior to making any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information or
application to or with any third party and/or Governmental Entity (including any
securities exchange) in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and
except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, each Party shall make all
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party with respect to the content
of such filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of
information or application and to provide the other Party with copies of the
proposed filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, statement of
information or application. Carnival and P&O Princess each shall not agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent practicable and
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. The foregoing requirements of Section 4.5.6
shall not apply to P&O Princess' discussions and meetings with the UK Inland
Revenue with respect to tonnage taxes and amendments to existing tonnage tax
elections; provided that P&O Princess shall notify Carnival of any such
discussions and meetings, and to the extent practicable, consult with Carnival
with respect thereto.

             4.5.7 Cooperation in Defense of Claim. In the event any claim,
action, suit investigation or other proceeding by any Governmental Entity or
other Person or other legal or administrative proceeding is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of this Agreement or any of the Transactions
or claims damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 4.5.3, to defend against and respond thereto.

        4.6  Access. In order to facilitate consummation of the Transactions,
the Parties hereby agree that upon reasonable request to an executive officer of
P&O Princess or Carnival, as the case may be, designated for the purpose, and
except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, each Party shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other Party's Representatives
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such
period, each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the
other all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
be requested by the other Party which it reasonably requires in order to
investigate and confirm the accuracy of such Party's representations and
warranties and the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing relating thereto;
provided that no receipt of information pursuant to this Section shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by Carnival or P&O
Princess hereunder; and provided, further that the foregoing shall not require
Carnival or P&O Princess to permit any inquiry, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of Carnival or P&O Princess, as the case may be,
would (i) violate any antitrust or competition Law or (ii) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality to third parties if Carnival or P&O
Princess, as the case may be, shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. All such
information shall be governed by the

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 11, 2002, between the
Parties (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), including without limitation all such
information disclosed in the Disclosure Letters.

        4.7 Publicity. Carnival and P&O Princess shall to the extent practicable
(i) consult with each other and, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or as required by the Takeover Panel, mutually agree on the
content prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Transactions and (ii) consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
which could materially affect the Transactions.

        4.8  Benefits and Other Matters.

             4.8.1   Director and Officer Liability.

                     4.8.1.1 P&O Princess and Carnival each agree that all
rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of
any Indemnitee (as defined below) in respect of acts or omissions of such
Indemnitee on or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the articles of
incorporation and by-laws, in the case of Carnival, or memorandum and articles
of association, in the case of P&O Princess, or an agreement between an
Indemnitee and it or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.

                     4.8.1.2 For six years after the Effective Time, P&O
Princess or Carnival, as the case may be, shall indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were officers or directors of
either Party or either Party's Subsidiaries (the "Indemnitees") to the same
extent as set forth in Section 4.8.1.1 above. In the event any claim in respect
of which indemnification is available pursuant to the foregoing provisions is
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
shall continue until such claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees
or other rulings in connection with such claim are duly satisfied.

                     4.8.1.3 For six years after the Effective Time, P&O
Princess and Carnival shall provide officers' and directors' liability insurance
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Person currently covered by its officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that during such period, Carnival and P&O Princess shall be required to
maintain or procure as much coverage as can be obtained for the remainder of
such period for an annual premium not in excess of 200% of the current annual
premium paid by P&O Princess or Carnival, as the case may be, for its existing
coverage.

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

                     4.8.1.4 The obligations of P&O Princess and Carnival under
this Section 4.8.1 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 4.8.1 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 4.8.1 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 4.8.1).

                     4.8.1.5 Each Party (the "Providing Party") shall indemnify
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, the
officers and directors of the other party in respect of all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses and liabilities arising from or in connection with the
information provided by such Providing Party for use in the Shareholder
Documents pursuant to Section 4.3 which contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or an omission to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

Time, the board of directors of each of Carnival and P&O Princess shall consist
of the individuals listed on Exhibit J (the "Mutual Directors"). Such Mutual
Directors shall be the directors of each of Carnival and P&O Princess from and
after the Effective Time until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with P&O Princess' memorandum and articles and Carnival's restated
articles of incorporation and by-laws, in each case as then in effect. Carnival
and P&O Princess agree to procure such resignations of their respective
directors as may be necessary so that at the Effective Time the Mutual Directors
are the only directors of Carnival and P&O Princess.

             4.8.3   Executive Officers. At the Effective Time, Micky Arison
shall be elected or appointed as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Carnival and P&O Princess, and Howard S. Frank shall be elected or appointed as
Chief Operating Officer of Carnival and P&O Princess, to serve in such
capacities until their respective successors are elected or appointed and shall
have qualified in accordance with the P&O Princess' memorandum and articles and
Carnival's restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, in each case as then
in effect. If at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, either of such
individuals shall be unwilling or unable to serve, a person to fill such
position shall be designated by the chief executive officer of Carnival at such
time.

        4.9  Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, whether or
not the Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense, except that the Parties each shall pay one-half of
filing fees and printer costs and expenses in connection with the preparation
and filing of the Shareholder Documents.

        4.10 Other Actions by Carnival and P&O Princess.

             4.10.1  Dividends. Except with respect to the distribution of the 0
SVT Shares by Carnival contemplated by this Agreement, Carnival and P&O Princess
shall coordinate the declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of
dividends on Carnival Common Stock and P&O Princess Ordinary Shares so that the
respective

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

holders of Carnival Common Stock and P&O Princess Ordinary Shares do not receive
two dividends in respect of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time
occurs or fail to receive a dividend in respect of the calendar quarter in which
the Effective Time occurs.

             4.10.2 Integration Planning. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Parties will establish
an integration planning committee (the "Integration Committee") to address and
agree upon integration issues. The Chief Executive Officer of each of Carnival
and P&O Princess shall determine which of their respective officers shall serve
on the Integration Committee and such Committee shall be comprised of an equal
number of persons from Carnival and P&O Princess.

        4.11 Carnival Offer to Exchange.  Section 4.11 is subject to applicable
Law.

             4.11.1  Offer to Exchange. Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Carnival
shall commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the
Offer, not later than ten business days after the effective date of the Joint
Registration Statement or earlier if required by the City Code. The Offer shall
be subject only to the conditions (the "Offer Conditions") set forth in Annex 1
hereto (including, without limitation, the occurrence of the Closing), of which
conditions 4 and 5 may be waived in whole or in part by Carnival in its sole
discretion. The P&O Princess EGM Circular shall state that P&O Princess
shareholders may (i) vote to approve the DLC Transactions; and/or (ii) accept
the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and in the
Offer Documents. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.11.4), Carnival shall
acquire all P&O Princess Ordinary Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer in compliance with the obligations respecting prompt
payment pursuant to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act and Rule 31.8 of the
City Code.

             4.11.2  Modification of the Offer, Fractional Shares. Subject to
the City Code, Carnival expressly reserves the right to modify the terms of the
Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of P&O Princess, Carnival
shall not (i) decrease the Offer Exchange Ratio, (ii) impose any conditions to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or modify the Offer Conditions
(other than to waive any Offer Conditions to the extent permitted by this
Agreement), (iii) except as provided in Section 4.11.3, extend the Offer, (iv)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (v) make any other
change or modification in any of the terms of the Offer in any manner that is
adverse to the holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, no certificates representing fractional shares
of Carnival Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the exchange of
Carnival Common Stock for P&O Princess Ordinary Shares upon consummation of the
Offer, and in lieu thereof each tendering shareholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Carnival Common Stock in the Offer will be
paid an amount in cash equal to either: (i)

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price of the Carnival
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not
reported therein, any other authoritative source) on the date the Offer becomes
unconditional; or (ii) the pro rata entitlement of such member to the net
proceeds of the sale of the aggregate fractional entitlements to Carnival Common
Stock which shall be sold in the market at the best price reasonably obtainable
by Carnival; provided always that Carnival shall be able to choose whether to
apply the procedure referred to in (i) or (ii) above, shall not be obliged to
give any reasons for such choice and such choice shall be conclusive and binding

any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its or their assets are

Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the approval by shareholders of Carnival referred to in
paragraph 5.1.1, by action of the board of directors of Carnival, if (i) the

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or
any event or circumstance shall occur as a result of which any such
representation and warranty shall not be true as of, and as if made on, any date
after the date hereof, which, in each case, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in paragraph 5.3.1 or 5.3.2 and cannot be or is not cured
prior to the Termination Date; or (iv) a third party announces a firm intention
(whether or not subject to a pre-condition) to make an offer or Acquisition
Proposal for P&O Princess (including an offer to form a dual-listed company)
which offer is (x) either subject to the City Code or is otherwise legally
binding and (y) in Carnival's reasonable opinion, acting in good faith and after
consultation with its financial advisers, the nature of such advice to be
communicated to P&O Princess, is likely to be more attractive to P&O Princess
Shareholders than the DLC Transactions.

          6.4  Termination by P&O Princess. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the approval by the shareholders of P&O Princess
referred to in paragraph 5.1.1, by action of the board of directors of P&O

of directors shall take any of the actions described in clause (ii) of the
proviso to Section 4.2.1; or (iii) there shall be a breach by Carnival of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or

condition set forth in paragraph 5.2.1 or 5.2.2 and cannot be or is not cured
prior to the Termination Date.

          6.5  Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

               6.5.1 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions pursuant to this Article VI,
this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 7.1) shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of either Party (or of any of its
Representatives); provided, however, that, subject to Section 7.1, no such
termination shall relieve either Party of any liability for damages resulting
from any breach of this Agreement or from any obligation

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

to pay, if applicable, the Carnival Termination Amount (as defined below) or the
P&O Princess Termination Amount (as defined below), as the case may be, pursuant
to Section 6.5.2 or 6.5.3.

               6.5.2 Carnival Break Fee. In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated by either Carnival or P&O Princess pursuant to Section 6.2(iii) and
at the time of the Carnival Shareholders Meeting an Acquisition Proposal exists
with respect to Carnival; or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by P&O Princess
pursuant to Section 6.4(i), 6.4(ii) or 6.4(iii) (solely with respect to a breach
of Section 4.2), then if any Acquisition Proposal involving Carnival is
implemented or completed on or before the day which is 18 months after the date
of this Agreement, Carnival shall promptly, but in no event later than two days
after the date of such implementation or completion, pay to P&O Princess a
termination payment equal to the Carnival Termination Amount, which amount shall
be exclusive of any expenses to be paid pursuant to Section 4.9, payable by wire
transfer of same day funds. The term "Carnival Termination Amount" shall mean
$49.4 million (representing 1 per cent of the market capitalisation of P&O
Princess on January 7, 2003). Carnival acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 6.5.2 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, P&O Princess would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Carnival fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 6.5.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, P&O
Princess commences a suit which results in a judgment against Carnival for the
payment set forth in this Section 6.5.2, Carnival shall pay to P&O Princess its
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the Carnival Termination Amount from each date for
payment until the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2 percent.

               6.5.3 P&O Princess Break Fee. In the event that (i) this
Agreement is terminated by either Carnival or P&O Princess pursuant to Section
6.2(iv) and at the time of the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting an Acquisition
Proposal exists with respect to P&O Princess; or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by Carnival pursuant to Section 6.3(i), 6.3(ii) or 6.3(iii) (solely
with respect to a breach of Section 4.2 then if any Acquisition Proposal
involving P&O Princess is implemented or completed on or before the day which is
18 months after the date of this Agreement, P&O Princess shall promptly, but in
no event later than two days after the date of such implementation or
completion, pay to Carnival a termination payment equal to the P&O Princess
Termination Amount, which amount shall be exclusive of any expenses to be paid
pursuant to Section 4.9, payable by wire transfer of same day funds. The term
"P&O Princess Termination Amount" shall mean $49.4 million (representing 1 per
cent. of the market capitalisation of P&O Princess on January 7, 2003). P&O
Princess acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.5.3 are an
integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Carnival
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if P&O Princess fails promptly
to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 6.5.3, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Carnival commences a suit which results in a judgment against P&O
Princess for the payment set forth in this Section 6.5.3, P&O Princess shall pay
to Carnival its costs and expenses (including

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the P&O
Princess Termination Amount from each date for payment until the date of such
payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made plus 2 percent.

(Expenses) shall survive the Effective Time. This Article VII (other than
Section 7.2 (Modification or Amendment), Section 7.3 (Waiver of Conditions) and

Section 3.1.3 (Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness), the agreements of
Carnival and P&O Princess contained in Section 4.9 (Expenses), Section 6.5
(Effect of Termination and Abandonment) and the last sentence of Section 4.6
(Access) and Section 4.11.7 and 4.11.8 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. All other representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in
this Agreement shall not survive the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall
relieve any Party from liability for any breach by it of its covenants and
agreements in this Agreement prior to such termination; provided that the sole
remedy of any Party for any breach by the other Party of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement other than those in Section 3.1.3 (Corporate
Authority; Approval; and Fairness) shall be the right (if any) to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 6.3 or Section 6.4, as applicable.

          7.2 Modification or Amendment. This Agreement may be modified or
amended by agreement of the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that, after approval by shareholders of the matters presented
at the Carnival Shareholders Meeting or the P&O Princess Shareholders Meeting,
no modification or amendment shall be made which under applicable Law requires
further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of each of the Parties.

          7.3 Waiver of Conditions. Any provision of this Agreement may be
waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if, such waiver is in writing
and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. For the
purposes of Article V, P&O Princess may waive any condition contained in Section
5.2 and Carnival may waive any condition contained in Section 5.3.

          7.4 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure
or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Except as otherwise herein provided, the rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by Law.

          7.5  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

          7.6  GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

               7.6.1 Governing Law And Venue. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO

                  7.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and schedules hereto), the Carnival Disclosure Letter, the P&O Princess
Disclosure Letter, the Stockholder Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. References
herein to this Agreement shall for all purposes be deemed to include references
to the Carnival Disclosure Letter and the P&O Princess Disclosure Letter. Except
as set forth in Section 4.8.1, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder except the
individuals who were directors of either Party on or prior to the Effective Time
shall be deemed third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 4.8, as
applicable. No employee or former employee of Carnival or P&O Princess who is
not a director of Carnival or P&O Princess shall be deemed a third party
beneficiary with respect to any provision of this Agreement. EACH PARTY HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NEITHER CARNIVAL NOR P&O PRINCESS MAKES ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WITH
RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE "TRANSACTIONS",
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER'S
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

          7.9  Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision unless the substitution of such provision would materially frustrate
the express intent and purposes of this Agreement or the Equalization and
Governance Agreement and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the
application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

          7.10 Interpretation. The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used herein with respect to any Party, a matter shall be deemed
to be "material" only if it is material to the Party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. A reference to any agreement or document is to that agreement or
document as amended, novated, supplemented, varied or replaced from time to
time, except to the extent prohibited by this Agreement. A reference to any
legislation (including any listing rules of a stock exchange or voluntary codes)
or to any provision of any legislation includes any modification or re-enactment
of it, any legislative provision substituted for it and all rules and
regulations and statutory instruments promulgated and issued under it. Nothing
in this Agreement or the DLC Documents will mean or be taken to imply that P&O
Princess or Carnival have agreed to dispose of or to acquire any interest in the
assets or undertakings of either of them. The parties hereto acknowledge that
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) has been drafted
jointly by the parties hereto and agree that this Agreement will

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

not be construed against any party as a result of any role such party may have
had in the drafting process.

          7.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise, and any purported assignment in violation of this provision
shall be void.

          7.12 No Partnership. Neither this Agreement nor the DLC Transactions
are intended for any legal, tax or other purpose to (i) alter the status of P&O
Princess and Carnival as separate, independent entities (taxed respectively and
exclusively as a United Kingdom and a Panamanian non-resident corporation), (ii)
result in any of Carnival, P&O Princess, their respective Subsidiaries, or their
respective shareholders being treated as creating an entity or otherwise
entering into any partnership, joint venture, association or agency
relationship, or (iii) give either Party (or its respective Subsidiaries or
shareholders) any legal or beneficial ownership interest in the assets or income
of the other Party, and shall not be construed as having such effect.

          7.13 Special Shares. The parties agree for all United States federal
income tax purposes to treat both the Carnival Special Share and the P&O
Princess Special Share as not constituting stock or any other equity interest in
Carnival or P&O Princess or any other entity.

                                      -45-

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the duly authorized officers of Carnival and P&O Princess as of the
date hereof.
