     This letter confirms the agreement of Buyer and Sellers that the Purchase

     (i)       the aggregate Cash Consideration for the Tokheim Assets shall be
$15,000,000, and there shall be no adjustment to such Cash Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 of the Purchase Agreement, and

     (ii)      in no event shall Sellers' Wabash Facility, Sellers' Washington

the approximately 40 acres of land located at Tokheim Professional Park on
Dupont Road be included in the Tokheim Assets (including, without limitation, as
Real Property). Furthermore, Buyer and Sellers agree to use their reasonable
best efforts to consummate such sale and purchase of the Tokheim Assets in
accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement with such changes as are
necessary to exclude the Gasboy Assets and reflect the general terms described
above.

     Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and
Sellers hereby agree that:

fixturing and manufacturing equipment in such facilities, which shall be Tokheim
Assets; provided, that Sellers shall retain at least $330,000 worth of fixtures
and Personal Property, assigned value as provided in Sellers liquidation
analysis which was provided to Buyer prior to the auction) located at the Wabash
Facility or the Washington Facility, or the approximately 40 acres of land
located at Tokheim Professional Park on Dupont Road be included in the Tokheim
Assets (including, without limitation, as Real Property);

     (iv)      Section 1.1 of the Purchase Agreement, including the Schedules
and the defined terms contained in Section 1.1, is deemed modified to the extent
necessary to exclude from the Acquired Assets all assets, properties, rights and
claims owned or held by Gasboy or, to the extent primarily related to the Gasboy
line of business, TG Canada, and such assets, properties, rights and claims are
deemed to be Excluded Assets;

     (v)       Section 1.3 of the Purchase Agreement, including the Schedules
and the defined terms contained in Section 1.3, is deemed modified to the extent
necessary to exclude from the Assumed Liabilities all Liabilities of TG Canada

are used only in such Sections;

     (viii)    the representations and warranties contained in Article III of
the Purchase Agreement, including the information on the Schedules contained in
Article III, are deemed modified such that the representations and warranties
are not given by Gasboy or, to the extent such representations and warranties
primarily relate to the Gasboy line of business, TG Canada, and the
representations and warranties shall only apply to the Tokheim Assets, and not
the Gasboy Assets;

     (ix)      the covenants and agreements contained in Article V of the
Purchase Agreement are deemed modified such that the covenants and agreements

TG Canada, and only with respect to the Tokheim Assets, and not the Gasboy
Assets;

     (x)       notwithstanding anything in this letter to the contrary, Section
5.8(d) of the Purchase Agreement is deemed to remain in effect without reference
