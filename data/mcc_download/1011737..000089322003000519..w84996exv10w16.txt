absence, the Chairman may recommend an award to such a participant based on the
proportion of the plan year that he/she was in active service with the Company.

Corporate Goal. The Corporate Goal for each plan year will be approved by the
Board of Directors. The Corporate Goal for the current plan year is set forth in
Appendix B.


                       SECTION IV - CALCULATION OF AWARDS
