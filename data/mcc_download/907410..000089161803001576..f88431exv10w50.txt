        any of the following events of default (subject to ESS's ability to cure
        or remedy such event as described in Section 13.3.3):

                13.3.1 ESS is involved in any voluntary or involuntary
                bankruptcy proceeding or any other proceeding concerning
                insolvency, dissolution, cessation of operations, reorganization
                or indebtedness or the like, and the proceeding is not dismissed
                within sixty (60) days,

                13.3.2 ESS becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they

        permit thirty (30) days following the date of such notice to enable the
        other party to cure the default. Failure to cure the default will result
        in termination without further notice by the non-defaulting party,

        notice or withdraws the default notice.

                termination date.

                13.5.2 All sublicense agreements entered into pursuant to this
                Agreement shall terminate immediately.

        13.6 SURVIVAL. The termination or expiration of this Agreement shall in
        no way relieve either party from its obligations to pay the other any
        sums accrued hereunder prior to such termination. The parties agree that
        their respective rights, obligations and duties under Section 4.7
        ("Profit Sharing"); Section 5 ("Accounting; Audit; Payment"), Section 7
        ("Disclaimer of Warranties"), Section 9 ("Propriety Rights Ownership"),
