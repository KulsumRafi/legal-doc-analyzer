<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to Registration Rights Agreement ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Amendment No.&nbsp;1</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") amends that certain
Registration Rights Agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") dated February&nbsp;22, 2000 by and among Nextel Partners,&nbsp;Inc. (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Company</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and the shareholders listed on the signature pages of the Agreement. Terms that are not defined in context are defined in the Agreement or in
that certain Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement dated as of February&nbsp;18, 2000, as amended, by and among Nextel Partners,&nbsp;Inc. and the various shareholders listed in such
agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties hereto agree that the existing Section&nbsp;3 of the Agreement shall be replaced in its entirety by the following new Section&nbsp;3: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holdback
Agreements. With respect to each and every Underwritten Public Offering: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Shareholder Party agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144, or any successor provision, under the
Securities Act, of any Registrable Securities (in each case, other than as part of such Underwritten Public Offering) during the 10 business days preceding the date scheduled for the beginning of the
"road show" to be conducted by the Company executives in connection with such offering (as determined by the managing underwriter in good faith) or, if a shorter time period, upon the date of receipt
of notice of the date scheduled for such Underwritten Public Offering, and ending not later than the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;90&nbsp;days following the effective date of the registration
statement filed in connection with the Underwritten Public Offering, (ii)&nbsp;the date that the Company and the managing underwriter determine not to complete the Underwritten Public Offering
within 10&nbsp;days following the completion of the road show, or (iii)&nbsp;60&nbsp;days after the start of the holdback period if the offering has not commenced by that date; provided,
however, that the holdback period for such Underwritten Public Offering shall not exceed 120&nbsp;days in aggregate. A holdback period for a subsequent Underwritten Public Offering shall not begin
sooner than 120&nbsp;days after the end of a prior holdback period; provided that this 120-day interval period shall not apply where the Company and the managing underwriter have
determined not to proceed with the Underwritten Public Offering following the road show; provided further, if the Company provides notice of a new holdback period within the 120-day period
following termination of the prior holdback period (as a result of a determination not to proceed with the Underwritten Public Offering), then in
such case the maximum number of days for which the new holdback period may apply shall be 120&nbsp;days less the number of days during which the prior holdback period was effective. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Shareholder Party agrees that, so long as a Demanding Shareholder has the right to request one or more Demand Registrations, each Shareholder Party will not effect
any public sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144, or any successor provision, under the Securities Act, of any Registrable Securities, during the 10 business days
preceding the date scheduled for the beginning of the "road show" to be conducted by the Company executives in connection with such offering (as determined by the managing underwriter in good faith)
or, if a shorter time period, upon the date of receipt of notice of the date scheduled for such Underwritten Public Offering, and ending not later than the earlier to occur of

underwriter determine not to complete the Underwritten Public Offering within 10&nbsp;days following the completion of the road show, or (iii)&nbsp;60&nbsp;days after the start of the holdback
