                This ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT is entered into as of
this 16th day of January, 2003 (the "Assignment Effective Date"), by and between

between UMG and Liquid Audio, Inc. ("Liquid"). Capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined shall have the same meanings described to them in the
Option Agreement. UMG and Geneva shall be referred to herein as the "Parties".

                                   WITNESSTH:

                WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Option Agreement, UMG has the right to assign its rights and obligations
thereunder to Anderson;

                WHEREAS, UMG has received a Trigger Event Notice from Liquid,
and UMG therefore has the right (but not the obligation) to exercise the option
described in the Option Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth therein
(but has not done so); and

                WHEREAS, Liquid has previously consented to the assignment of
the Option Agreement to Anderson, and the consent of Liquid to this Agreement is
required to effectuate the assignment to Geneva hereunder;

                NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby confirmed and acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

                        1.      UMG and Liquid hereby agree that references to
                Anderson in the Option Amendment will be deemed to be replaced
                with Geneva;

                        2.      Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
                Option Agreement, UMG hereby irrevocably sells, transfers,
                conveys, assigns and delivers to Geneva, as of the Assignment
                Effective Date, all of UMG's rights and obligations to and under
                the Option Agreement. Each of the Parties represents that it has
                all necessary authority to enter into this Agreement and to
                effectuate the transactions contemplated herein. Notwithstanding
                the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that UMG
                retains each of its obligations under Paragraph 2(b) of the
                Option Amendment.

                        3.      Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
                Option Agreement, Geneva hereby assumes and agrees that it is
                bound by all of UMG's obligations under the Option Agreement,
                and agrees to perform all of the obligations of UMG under the
                Option Agreement. Geneva does not hereby

                assume and shall have no liability for any debt, liability or
                obligation of UMG of whatsoever kind or nature other than as

                shall be an express third party beneficiary of Geneva's
                assumption and other agreements in this Section 3.

                        4.      This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
                shall be binding upon and insure to the benefit of the parties
                hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

                        5.      This Agreement shall be governed by and
                construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
                California.
