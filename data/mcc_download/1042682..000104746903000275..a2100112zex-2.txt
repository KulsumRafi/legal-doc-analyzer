                     COGNICASE SUPPORTS CGI'S REVISED OFFER


MONTREAL, QUEBEC, JANUARY 1, 2003 - CGI Group Inc. ("CGI") (TSX: GIB.A; NYSE:
GIB) and COGNICASE Inc. ("COGNICASE") (TSX: COG; Nasdaq: COGI) announced today
that they have entered into a support agreement (the "Support Agreement")
whereby COGNICASE will support CGI's revised Offer and the Board of Directors of
COGNICASE has agreed to recommend the acceptance of such revised Offer to its
shareholders. The consideration payable under CGI's revised Offer shall be
increased from $4.25 to $4.50 cash and from 0.5484 to 0.6311 Class A Subordinate
Shares ("CGI Shares") of CGI per COGNICASE share subject to a maximum aggregate
cash consideration and a maximum aggregate share consideration, representing
respectively, on any take-up date, a value equal to 56% and 44% of the aggregate
revised Offer price payable under the revised Offer on such take-up date using a
CGI Share price of $7.13. Under the revised Offer, the number of CGI Shares to
be issued would remain essentially the same as under the initial Offer.

BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., financial advisors to the special committee of
COGNICASE's Board of Directors, has delivered to the Board of Directors a
written opinion to the effect that the consideration provided by CGI's revised
Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of COGNICASE.
Based on the foregoing, the Board has concluded that the consideration provided
by CGI's revised Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
shareholders of COGNICASE and recommends to shareholders the acceptance thereof.

COGNICASE's Board has resolved to waive the application of the shareholder
rights plan dated December 19, 2002 ("Rights Plan") to CGI's revised Offer in
order to allow CGI to proceed with the revised Offer and take-up and pay for
COGNICASE shares deposited into the revised Offer without any dilutive effects.

Pursuant to the Support Agreement, COGNICASE has agreed to cease any ongoing
discussions and not to solicit or engage in any further discussions relating to
a competing proposal except in limited circumstances and that if, among other
things, COGNICASE's Board modifies or withdraws its recommendation in favour of
CGI's revised Offer or recommends to shareholders the acceptance of a take-over
bid or any other transaction other than CGI's revised Offer, COGNICASE would pay
to CGI an amount equal to $0.09 (or 2% of the cash consideration per share) per
COGNICASE share which are the object of CGI's revised Offer.

The Notice of Change and Variation of CGI containing a complete description of
CGI's revised Offer shall be mailed to shareholders of COGNICASE by no later
than January 3, 2003. The Notice of Change to the Directors' Circular of
COGNICASE containing the recommendation to shareholders to accept CGI's revised
Offer shall be mailed to shareholders of COGNICASE by no later than January 6,
2003.

CGI's revised Offer represents a 48% and 59% premium over the 20-day and 90-day
weighted average closing price of the COGNICASE shares on the Toronto Stock
Exchange ("TSX"), respectively, on the day prior to the announcement of the
Offer on December 6, 2002. CGI's revised Offer also represents a 32.4% premium
over the closing price of the COGNICASE shares on the TSX on such date.
