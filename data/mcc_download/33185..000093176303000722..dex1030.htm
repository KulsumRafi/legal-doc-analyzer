contributions are made. Except as provided in Section 4.1 herein, after separate subtrusts are established, assets allocated to one subtrust may not be utilized to provide benefits under any other subtrust until all benefits payable under such
subtrust have been paid in full. Payments to general creditors in the event of the Company becoming Insolvent shall be charged against the subtrusts in proportion to their account balances, except that payment of benefits to a Participant as a
