hereby acknowledges and agrees that Assignee would not have entered into the
Restated Agreement without this Assignment.

                  4.       Representations, Warranties and Covenants of
Assignor. Assignor represents and warrants that: (i) Assignor is the sole owner
of the entire optionee's interest in the Option; (ii) Assignor has full power

connection with the Lease or the Option, or under or by reason of this
Assignment, and from any and all third party claims and demands whatsoever,
including the defense of any such claims or demands which may be asserted
against Assignee by reason of any alleged obligations and undertakings on its
part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants or agreements contained
in the Lease or the Option other than third party claims arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Assignee. Should Assignee incur any
such liability, the amount thereof, including costs, expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees, shall be secured hereby and by the Debt Documents and Assignor
shall reimburse Assignee therefor immediately upon demand and upon the failure
of Assignor so to do Assignee may, at its option, declare all sums secured
hereby and under the Debt Documents immediately due and payable. This Assignment

management or repair of the Property upon Assignee, nor for the carrying out of
any of the terms and conditions of the Lease or the Option; nor shall it operate
to make Assignee responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property
by Assignor, or any tenants, occupants or any other parties, or for any
dangerous or defective condition of the Property, including, without limitation,

reduction or satisfaction of the Obligations without prejudice to any of its
rights under this Assignment.

                  10.      Other Remedies. Nothing contained in this Assignment
and no act done or omitted by Assignee pursuant to the power and rights granted
to Assignee hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver by Assignee of its rights
and remedies under the Debt Documents and this Assignment is made and accepted
without prejudice to any of the rights and remedies possessed by Assignee under
the terms thereof.

                  11.      Conflict of Terms. In case of any conflict between

the Debt Documents shall prevail.

hereof may not be modified, amended, waived, extended, changed, discharged or
terminated orally, or by any act or failure to act on the part of Assignor or
Assignee, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom
the enforcement of any modification, amendment, waiver, extension, change,
discharge or termination is sought.

                  13.      Non-Waiver. The failure of Assignee to insist upon
strict performance of any term hereof shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
term of this Assignment. Assignor shall not be relieved of Assignor's
obligations hereunder by reason of (i) failure of Assignee to comply with any
request of Assignor or any other party to take any action to enforce any of the
provisions hereof or of the Debt Documents, (ii) the release, regardless of
consideration, of the whole or any part of the Obligations, or (iii) any
agreement or stipulation by Assignee extending the time of payment or otherwise

held by Assignee in such order and manner as Assignee, in its discretion, may
elect. Assignee may take any action to recover the Obligations, or any portion
thereof, or to enforce any covenant hereof without prejudice to the right of
Assignee thereafter to enforce its rights under this Assignment. The rights of
Assignee under this Assignment shall be separate, distinct and cumulative and
none shall be given effect to the exclusion of the others. No act of Assignee
shall be construed as an election to proceed under any one provision herein to
the exclusion of any other provision.

                  14.      Inapplicable Provisions. If any term, covenant or
condition of this Assignment is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, this Assignment shall be construed without such provision.

covenants and agrees not to deliver the Exercise Letter to Optionor unless and
until the earlier to occur of (i) a default under this Assignment pursuant to
Section 6 hereof; or (ii) Assignor fails to exercise the Option on or before the
Exercise Deadline (as defined in the Restated Agreement) (the "Trigger Event").
Upon the occurrence and continuation of the Trigger Event, and upon GE Capital's
(or its nominee) issuance of a commitment letter to finance Assignor's
acquisition of the Property (the "Commitment"), the Exercise Letter shall be
tendered to the Optionor and so long as the Commitment has not been terminated
or rescinded Assignor shall fully perform all of its obligations under the Real
Estate Sales Contract previously agreed upon between Assignor and Optionor. The
Commitment shall provide that the aggregate amount of monthly debt service
(principal and interest) shall not exceed Forty-Two Thousand Dollars
($42,000.00); provided, further, that such other terms and conditions of the
Commitment shall be determined in the reasonable discretion of GE Capital or its
nominee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Assignor acknowledges and agrees that GE
Capital shall be under no obligation to provide such purchase money financing
for the Property upon the Trigger Event or otherwise.

                  8.       No Liability of Assignee. Assignee shall not be
liable for any loss sustained by Assignor resulting from Assignee's exercise of,
or failure to exercise, the Option. Assignee shall not be obligated to perform
or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Lease or the Option or
under or by reason of this Assignment, and Assignor shall, and hereby agrees to,
indemnify and defend Assignee for, and hold Assignee harmless from and against,
any and all liability, loss or damage which may or might be incurred under or in
connection with the Lease or the Option, or under or by reason of this
Assignment, and from any and all third party claims and demands whatsoever,
including the defense of any such claims or demands which may be asserted
against Assignee by reason of any alleged obligations and undertakings on its
part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants or agreements contained
in the Lease or the Option other than third party claims arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Assignee. Should Assignee incur any
such liability, the amount thereof, including costs, expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees, shall be secured hereby and by the Debt Documents and Assignor
shall reimburse Assignee therefor immediately upon demand and upon the failure
of Assignor so to do Assignee may, at its option, declare all sums secured
hereby and under the Debt Documents immediately due and payable. This Assignment
shall not operate to place any obligation or liability for the control, care,
management or repair of the Property upon Assignee, nor for the carrying out of
any of the terms and conditions of the Lease or the Option; nor shall it operate
to make Assignee responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property
by Assignor, or any tenants, occupants or any other parties, or for any
dangerous or defective condition of the Property, including, without limitation,
the presence of any hazardous materials or substances, or for any negligence in
the management, upkeep, repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or
injury or death to Assignor, or any tenant, licensee, employee, guest, invitee
or any other person.

                  9.       Other Security. Assignee may take or release other
security for the payment of the Obligations, release any party primarily or
secondarily liable therefor and apply
<PAGE>
any other security held by it to the reduction or satisfaction of the
Obligations without prejudice to any of its rights under this Assignment.

                  10.      Other Remedies. Nothing contained in this Assignment
and no act done or omitted by Assignee pursuant to the power and rights granted
to Assignee hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver by Assignee of its rights
and remedies under the Debt Documents and this Assignment is made and accepted
without prejudice to any of the rights and remedies possessed by Assignee under
the terms thereof.

                  11.      Conflict of Terms. In case of any conflict between
the terms of this Assignment and the terms of the Debt Documents, the terms of
the Debt Documents shall prevail.

                  12.      No Oral Change. This Assignment and any provisions
hereof may not be modified, amended, waived, extended, changed, discharged or
terminated orally, or by any act or failure to act on the part of Assignor or
Assignee, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom
the enforcement of any modification, amendment, waiver, extension, change,
discharge or termination is sought.

                  13.      Non-Waiver. The failure of Assignee to insist upon
strict performance of any term hereof shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
term of this Assignment. Assignor shall not be relieved of Assignor's
obligations hereunder by reason of (i) failure of Assignee to comply with any
request of Assignor or any other party to take any action to enforce any of the
provisions hereof or of the Debt Documents, (ii) the release, regardless of
consideration, of the whole or any part of the Obligations, or (iii) any
agreement or stipulation by Assignee extending the time of payment or otherwise
modifying or supplementing the terms of this Assignment or the Debt Documents.
Assignee may resort for the payment of the Obligations to any other security
held by Assignee in such order and manner as Assignee, in its discretion, may
elect. Assignee may take any action to recover the Obligations, or any portion
thereof, or to enforce any covenant hereof without prejudice to the right of
Assignee thereafter to enforce its rights under this Assignment. The rights of
Assignee under this Assignment shall be separate, distinct and cumulative and
none shall be given effect to the exclusion of the others. No act of Assignee
shall be construed as an election to proceed under any one provision herein to
the exclusion of any other provision.

                  14.      Inapplicable Provisions. If any term, covenant or
condition of this Assignment is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, this Assignment shall be construed without such provision.

                  15.      Counterparts. This Assignment may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when take together shall constitute a
single agreement.

                  16.      Notice. Notice to the parties shall be provided at
the addresses and in the manner set forth in the Debt Documents.

                  17.      Governing Law. This Assignment shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.
<PAGE>
                  18.      Termination of Assignment. Upon payment in full of
the Obligations and the satisfaction or discharge of the Debt Documents, this
Assignment shall become and be void and of no effect.

                  19.      Successors and Assigns. This Assignment, together
with the covenants and warranties herein contained, shall inure to the benefit
of Assignee and any subsequent holder of or successor to the Debt Documents and
shall be binding upon Assignor, its successors and assigns and any subsequent
holder of the Obligations.

                  20.      Recordable Document. Assignor hereby acknowledges and
agrees that Assignee shall record this Assignment against the Property.
