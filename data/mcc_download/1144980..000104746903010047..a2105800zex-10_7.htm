<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
agreement is entered into as of November&nbsp;1, 2002 between Asbury Automotive Group,&nbsp;Inc. ("Asbury") and Robert D. Frank ("Executive"), a key employee of Asbury, in order to provide
for an agreed-upon compensation in the event that Executive's employment is terminated as defined in this agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1. Severance Pay Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Termination (as defined below) of Executive's employment occurs at any time during Executive's employment, Asbury will pay Executive 12&nbsp;months of
Executive's base salary as of the date of Termination as Severance Pay. Payment (subject to required withholding) will be made by Asbury to Executive monthly on the regular payroll dates of Asbury
starting with the date of Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Executive participates in a bonus compensation plan at the date of Termination, Severance Pay will also include a portion of the target bonus for the year of Termination in an amount
equal to the target bonus multiplied by the percentage of such year that has expired through the date of Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, Executive shall be entitled for 12&nbsp;months following the date of Termination to continue to participate at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution in any
health, dental, disability and life insurance plans, as may be amended from time to time, in which Executive was participating immediately prior to the date of Termination. Such participation will
terminate 30&nbsp;days after Executive has obtained other employment under which Executive is covered by equal benefits. Executive agrees to notify Asbury promptly upon obtaining such other
employment. At the option of Executive, COBRA coverage will be available, as provided by company policy, at the termination of the extended benefits provided above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2. Change of Control Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a Termination occurs at any time within two years after a Change of Control, then (1)&nbsp;the term "12&nbsp;months" in the first and third
paragraphs of Section&nbsp;1 of this agreement shall be replaced with "36&nbsp;months" and (2)&nbsp;the term "one year" in Section&nbsp;5 and Section&nbsp;6 of this agreement shall be
replaced with "36&nbsp;months". For purposes of this Section, "Change of Control" shall having the meaning ascribed to such term in Asbury's 2002 Stock Option Plan, as such plan may be amended from
time to time. </FONT></P>

reason, except death, disability, retirement, voluntary resignation or "cause", or (2)&nbsp;termination by Executive because of mandatory relocation of Executive's current principal place of
business to a location more than 50 miles away, or (3)&nbsp;Asbury's reduction of Executive's base salary, or (4)&nbsp;any material diminution of Executive's duties or job title, except in a
termination for "cause", death, "disability," retirement or voluntary resignation. The definition of "cause" is: (a)&nbsp;Executive's gross negligence or serious misconduct (including, without
limitation, any criminal, fraudulent or dishonest conduct) that is injurious to Asbury or any of its affiliates; or (b)&nbsp;Executive being convicted of, or entering a plea of nolo contendere to,
any crime that constitutes a felony or involves moral turpitude; or (c)&nbsp;Executive's material breach of Sections 4, 5 or 6 below or (d)&nbsp;Executive's willful and continued failure to
substantially perform Executive's duties with Asbury or (e)&nbsp;Executive's material breach of a material written policy of Asbury. The definition of </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, if any severance pay or benefits payable under this agreement (without the application of this
Section&nbsp;7), either alone or together with other payments, awards, benefits or distributions (or any acceleration of any payment, award, benefit or distribution) pursuant to any agreement, plan
or arrangement with Asbury or any of its affiliates (the "Total Payments"), would constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as

Asbury shall pay Executive the full amount of the Total Payments without reduction. If the result derived from clause&nbsp;(a) above is not greater than the result derived in clause&nbsp;(b) above
by more than 10% of the result derived in clause&nbsp;(b) above, then Asbury shall pay Executive the maximum Total Payments possible without any such Total Payments being characterized as Excess
