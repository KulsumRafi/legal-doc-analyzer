Inc. ("Valley," together with Globe and Interstate, the "Borrowers") (as the
same may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or extended from time to
time, the "MLA"), and (ii) the First Supplement to the Master Loan Agreement,
dated as of June 29, 2001, between CoBank and Borrowers (as the same may be

CoBank to (i) consent to the discharge and release by Valley of the Notes
purchased by Valley prior to the date hereof, the aggregate value of such
discharged and released Notes not to exceed $22,800,000, (ii) release and
discharge any lien or security interest that CoBank may have in such Notes, and
(iii) waive the Event of Default arising under the Loan Agreement in connection
the purchase of the Notes by Valley and the subsequent failure to enter into an
Investment Account Pledge Agreement. In reliance on the representations and
warranties provided by the Borrowers to CoBank set forth in this letter
agreement and in connection with this request, and subject to the satisfaction
by the Borrowers or waiver by CoBank of the conditions precedent set forth
below, CoBank hereby (i) consents to the discharge and release by Valley of the
Notes purchased by Valley prior to the date hereof, provided, the aggregate
value of such Notes shall not exceed $22,800,000, (ii) releases and discharges
any lien or security interest it may have in such Notes, (iii) waives the Event
of Default arising under the Loan Agreement in connection the purchase of the
Notes by Valley and its subsequent failure to enter into an Investment Account
Pledge Agreement, and (iv) amends the provisions of Subsection 8(E) of the MLA
to delete Subsection 8(E)(iv) in its entirety.
