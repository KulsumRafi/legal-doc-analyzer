     offsets by customers  that relate to matters for which Buyer is responsible
     under this Agreement  ("Customer Claims")  (Promotional  Payable Claims and
     Customer Claims being referred to herein as "Post-Closing  Claims"). In the
     event a party (the "Receiving Party") receives  Post-Closing Claims, it may
     submit  such  claims to the other  party (the  "Paying  Party") on a weekly
     basis, with any documentation  related to the Post-Closing  Claims received

     the Receiving Party, by wire transfer,  the amount of such Submitted Claims
     on the third  business  day  following  the date on which it  received  the
     Submitted Claims.  If such payment is not made timely,  the Receiving Party
     will be entitled to interest thereon at the rate of 18% per annum.

          (b)  <u>Monthly  True-up</u>.  A  Paying  Party  may,  after  the end of each
     calendar  month,  conduct an audit of the books and  records of a Receiving
     Party to confirm the existence of all Submitted  Claims and the accuracy of
     the  calculation of the Submitted  Claims and Receiving  Party will provide
     Paying Party and its agents  reasonable access to its books and records for
     this purpose.  In the event a Paying Party  reasonably  determines  that it
     overpaid  a  Submitted  Claim,  the  Receiving  Party  will  reimburse  the
     overpayment  by wire  transfer  on the third  business  day  following  the
     receipt by it of written notice of overpayment.

          (c) Time Limit.  The provisions of Section 3.3 shall terminate on June
     30, 2003.

all  jurisdictions  in  which  it is  required  to be so  qualified  and in good

default by Seller under any Contract. To the Seller's knowledge, there have been
no events  of  default,  and no state of facts  exists  that with  notice or the
passage  of time,  or both,  would  constitute  an event of  default  under  any
contract by any party other than  Seller.  Except as set forth on Schedule  5.7,
the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement will not
(and will not give any Person a right to)  terminate or modify any rights of, or

Buyer  pursuant to Article IV of this  Agreement  will be valid,  sufficient and
effective  to  completely  transfer  to Buyer all of Seller's  right,  title and

Authority.  Seller is not in default  or  violation  with  respect to any order,
writ,  injunction,  garnishment,  levy, or decree of any Governmental  Authority
applicable  to the  Assets  or the  Branded  Products,  and the use,  operation,
ownership,  or transfer of the Assets does not constitute a default or violation
thereunder.  Neither  the  condition  of the  Assets  nor the  Branded  Products
violates  in  any  material  respect  any  federal,  state,  or  municipal  law,
regulation or rule.

with respect to any Taxes,  nor are any such matters under  discussion  with any
Governmental Authority as they relate to the Business or the Assets.

          (b) any  misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Buyer in this
     Agreement or in any document,  certificate or Schedule delivered hereunder;
     or

          (c) any  non-fulfillment  of any  covenant or agreement by Buyer under
     this Agreement.

     <b>Section 10.4.</b> <b><u>Time to Assert Claims</u>.</b>  Any Buyer  Indemnification  Claims or
Seller  Indemnification Claims made pursuant to this Article must be asserted by
providing written notice to the party against which the Indemnification Claim is
made  reasonably  promptly after the asserting party becomes aware of such Claim
(the  "Indemnification  Claim  Notice").  The right of a party to be indemnified
hereunder  shall not be adversely  affected by such party's failure to give such
Indemnification Claim Notice unless, and then only to the extent that, the party
against  which the  Indemnification  Claim is made is  prejudiced  thereby.  The
parties shall resolve disputes between them regarding  Indemnification Claims in
accordance with Article XI. The term "Indemnification  Claim" shall mean a Buyer
Indemnification Claim or a Seller Indemnification Claim, as appropriate.

     <b>Section 10.5.</b> <b><u>Third Party Claim Indemnification  Procedure</u>.</b>  An indemnified
person shall  promptly  notify the  indemnifying  party of the  existence of any
Indemnification  Claim  resulting  from a claim made by a third  party and shall
give the  indemnifying  party  the  opportunity  to  defend  the same at its own
expense and with counsel of its own  selection,  provided that such  indemnified
person  shall at all  times  also  have the  right to  participate  fully in the
defense of the  Indemnification  Claim at its own expense.  If the  indemnifying
party shall,  within twenty (20) days after such notice, fail to acknowledge its
indemnification  obligation  hereunder in writing or  thereafter  fail to defend
such  Indemnification  Claim  adequately and  reasonably,  and such  indemnified
person is entitled  to such  defense,  such  indemnified  person  shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense of, and to compromise or
settle (exercising  reasonable business judgment) such Indemnification  Claim on
behalf,  for the  account,  and the sole risk and expense,  of the  indemnifying
party.

     <b>Section 10.6.</b> <b><u>Limitations on Indemnification</u>.</b>

          (a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary,  the indemnifying party
     shall not be liable for an Indemnification Claim under this Article for:

               (i)  any  Indemnification  Claim,  unless and until the aggregate
                    amount  of all such  Indemnification  Claims  otherwise  due
                    exceeds an accumulated total of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
                    ($100,000.00); or

               (ii) any Indemnification Claim to the extent arising directly out
                    of   the   acts   or   omissions   of  the   party   seeking
                    indemnification.

          (b) The maximum aggregate amount of all Indemnification Claims (except
     for those  set  forth in  subsection  (c)  below)  for which a party may be
     responsible  or  otherwise  liable  (whether for  indemnification,  breach,
     default  or  otherwise)   under  this  Article  and  this   Agreement  (the
     "Unintentional   Claims")   shall  be  the  sum  of  One  Million   Dollars
     ($1,000,000.00).


                                       20

          (c) The maximum aggregate amount of all  Indemnification  Claims based
     upon intentional misrepresentation, fraud or willful misconduct for which a
     party may be responsible or otherwise liable (whether for  indemnification,
     breach,  default or otherwise)  under this Article and this  Agreement (the
     "Intentional   Claims")   shall  be  the  sum  of  Five   Million   Dollars
     ($5,000,000.00).

          (d) The  maximum  aggregate  amount of all  Unintentional  Claims  and
     Intentional  Claims  combined  shall  be the  sum of Five  Million  Dollars
     ($5,000,000.00).

                                  <b>ARTICLE XI.
                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>

     <b>Section 11.1.</b> <b><u>General</u>.</b> All disputes between the parties arising under or in
connection with this Agreement,  including Indemnification Claims (as more fully
described below,  "Claims"),  shall be resolved in accordance with the following
procedures.

     <b>Section  11.2.</b> <b><u>Negotiation</u>.</b>  A party with a Claim (the  "Claiming  Party")
shall  give  reasonably  prompt  notice  (the  "Claim  Notice")  to  the  other,
specifically  identifying the issue and amount in dispute.  Senior executives of
the parties or their representatives shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to
resolve the Claim in the absence of attorneys and other  non-employer  advisors.
During this process, either party may request that an independent third party be
used to  mediate  the  dispute.  If the  parties  do not  resolve  the  Claim by
negotiation  within 60 days after receipt of the Claim Notice,  either party may
submit the Claim for binding arbitration.

     <b>Section 11.3.</b> <b><u>Arbitration; Claims Covered; Conclusive Determination</u>.</b> Claims
not settled by negotiation  shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance  with
the American Arbitration  Association  procedures for Commercial Arbitration and
any supplemental rules deemed appropriate by the arbitrator (the  "Procedures").
The arbitration shall be conducted in the city of Kansas City, Missouri.  Claims
by either party for injunctive or other equitable relief, for unfair competition
and  the  use  or  unauthorized   disclosure  of  trade  secrets,   confidential
information,  or  intellectual  property,  are not  covered by this  Section and
either  party  may seek  and  obtain  relief  for  such  Claims  from a court of
competent  jurisdiction.  The  decision  of the  arbitrator  may be entered as a
judgment in any court of competent  jurisdiction  thereof.  Any  arbitral  award
shall be a conclusive  determination  of the matter,  final and binding upon all
parties.

     <b>Section 11.4.</b> <b><u>Arbitration Procedures;  Survival</u>.</b> The parties agree that the
procedures  and  provisions  set  forth  in  <u>Schedule  11.4</u>  shall  apply to any
arbitration  under this Section.  This Agreement to arbitrate  shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

     <b>Section 11.5.</b> <b><u>Confidentiality</u>.</b>  All aspects of the proceedings provided for
by this Agreement,  including the exchange of information during discovery,  any
hearings,  and the record of the proceedings,  are confidential and shall not be
open to the public,  except (a) to the extent the  parties  agree  otherwise  in
writing,  (b) as may be appropriate in any  subsequent  proceedings  between the
parties, or (c) as may otherwise be required by a Governmental  Authority or the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange.

                             SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE</b>

     <b>Section 12.1.</b> <b><u>Contract  Manufacturing  Agreement  Amendment</u>.</b>  From the date
hereof through Closing, the parties shall continue to perform under the Contract
Manufacturing Agreement. As of the Closing, the Contract Manufacturing Agreement
shall  be  amended  pursuant  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Contract
Manufacturing Agreement Amendment, in the form of Exhibit 12.1 hereof.

     <b>Section 12.2.</b> <b><u>Settlement and Release</u>.</b>  Except as otherwise provided in this
Section  12.2,  as of the Closing  each of Buyer and Seller,  for itself and its
Affiliates,   successors   and   assigns,   does  hereby   fully,   finally  and
unconditionally release and forever discharge the other, the others' Affiliates,
agents,  attorneys,  employees,  directors and officers,  and all successors and
assigns,  and  representatives  of  each  of the  foregoing  (collectively,  the

Parties, from any and all debts, claims, obligations, damages, costs, attorneys'
fees, suits, demands, liabilities, actions, proceedings and causes of action, in
each case whether known or unknown,  contingent or fixed, direct or indirect and
of  whatever  nature or  description  and  whether  in law or in  equity,  under
contract,  tort,  statute or otherwise,  which each has heretofore had or now or
hereafter can, shall or may have against the Released Parties arising from acts,
claims  or  events  related  to or  arising  out of the  Contract  Manufacturing
Agreement  prior to the Closing and any performance or  nonperformance  prior to
the Closing thereunder.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  this Section in no way
pertains to the following:

          (a) this Agreement,  the other agreements  executed in connection with
     this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

          (b) the obligations of Seller to pay the production  invoices of Buyer

     <b>Section  13.2.</b> <b><u>Applicable  Law</u>.</b>  This  Agreement,   and  the  rights  and
obligations  of the  parties  hereto,  shall be governed  by and  determined  in
accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri,  without giving effect to the
choice or conflicts of law provisions thereof.

     <b>Section 13.3.</b> <b><u>Benefit and Assignment</u>.</b> This Agreement shall be binding upon,
and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective  successors
and permitted  assigns.  Neither this Agreement nor any rights  hereunder may be
assigned or transferred,  and no duties may be delegated,  by Seller without the
prior  written  consent of Buyer.  Buyer may assign or  transfer  its rights and
delegate its duties hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer.

     <b>Section 13.4.</b> <b><u>No Third Party Beneficiary</u>.</b> This Agreement is for the benefit
of, and may be  enforced  only by, the parties  who are  signatories  hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not for the
benefit of, and may not be enforced by, any third party.

     <b>Section 13.5.</b> <b><u>Expenses</u>.</b>  Except as otherwise  provided in this  Agreement,
each party hereto shall pay its own expenses  incurred in  connection  with this
Agreement  and in the  preparation  for  and  consummation  of the  transactions
provided for herein.

     <b>Section 13.6.</b> <b><u>Waiver</u>.</b>  Except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement,  no
delay or failure on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,  power
or  privilege  under this  Agreement or under any other  instrument  or document
given in connection with or pursuant to


                                       23


</pre>
<hr>
<pre>


this Agreement  shall impair any such right,  power or privilege or be construed
as a waiver of any  default or any  acquiescence  therein.  No single or partial
exercise  of any such  right,  power or  privilege  shall  preclude  the further
exercise of such right, power or privilege,  or the exercise of any other right,
power or  privilege.  No waiver shall be valid  against any party hereto  unless
made in writing and signed by the party against whom  enforcement of such waiver
is sought and then only to the extent expressly specified therein.

     <b>Section 13.7.</b> <b><u>Equitable  Relief;  Remedies  Cumulative;  Interest</u>.</b>  Seller
hereby  acknowledges that irreparable injury may result to Buyer in the event of
a breach of this  Agreement to Seller.  It is therefore  agreed that,  if Seller
breaches this  Agreement,  Buyer may seek, in addition to any other remedies and
damages  available:  (i) an injunction to restrain the violation thereof by such
party, or its shareholders,  directors, agents, servants, employers or employees
of such party,  and all Persons  acting for or with such party and (ii) specific
performance  of the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement.  All  rights  and
remedies  granted in this Agreement or available under law or at equity shall be
deemed concurrent and cumulative,  and not alternative or exclusive remedies, to
the full extent permitted by law and this Agreement.  Any party may proceed with
any number of remedies at the same time or in any order. The exercise of any one
right or remedy  shall not be deemed a waiver or release  of any other  right or
remedy. The parties waive any right they may have to require,  or any obligation
on the part of,  another party to post a bond in  connection  with any equitable
remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein,  each party shall be entitled to
interest on any  amounts  owed by and not timely paid by the other from the date
such amount was first due to be paid until the date of actual payment thereof at
the prime rate of Citibank,  N.A.,  as  published  from time to time in The Wall
Street Journal.

     <b>Section 13.8.</b> <b><u>Further Actions; Transition</u>.</b>

          (a) If at any time after the Closing any further  action is  necessary
     or desirable to carry out the purposes of this  Agreement,  each party will
     take such further  action  (including  the  execution  and delivery of such
     further  instruments  and  documents)  as the other  party  reasonably  may
     request,  all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting  party (unless
     the requesting party is entitled to indemnification  therefor under Article
     X).

          (b) Seller  shall not take any action  that is designed or intended to
     have the effect of  discouraging  any customer,  supplier or other business
     associate of Seller from  establishing  or  maintaining  the same  business
     relationships  with Buyer  after the Closing as it  maintained  with Seller
     prior to the Closing relating to the Assets. Seller will refer all customer
     inquiries  relating  to the  Branded  Products  to Buyer from and after the
     Closing.

          (c) In the event that Buyer or Seller receives funds after the Closing
     which belong to or are property  payable to the other,  the receiving party
     shall  promptly  endorse  over  or  otherwise  pay to the  other  all  such
     erroneously received funds.

     <b>Section 13.9.</b> <b><u>Entire Agreement; Amendment</u>.</b> This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto and the  Confidentiality  Agreement contain the entire
Agreement of the parties  hereto with respect to the  transactions  contemplated
hereby  and  supersede  any  and  all  prior   agreements,   arrangements,   and
understandings between the parties. No inducements

contrary to the terms of this Agreement exist. No waiver of any term, provision,
or condition of this Agreement,  whether by conduct or otherwise,  in any one or
more instances shall be construed as a further or continuing  waiver of any such
term,  provision or condition or any other term,  provision or condition of this
Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified orally and may only be amended in
a writing executed by all parties hereto.

     <b>Section 13.10.</b> <b><u>Counterparts</u>.</b>  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts,  each of which  shall  constitute  an  original,  but all of which
together shall constitute a single agreement.

     <b>Section 13.11.</b> <b><u>Termination</u>.</b>

          (a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows

               (i)  At any time by the mutual consent of Seller and Buyer;

               (ii) By either party, at its sole election,  if the Closing shall
                    not have occurred on or before October 31, 2003, unless such
                    party  has  taken  action  (or  failed  to take  action)  in
                    violation  of this  Agreement  and which caused delay in the
                    Closing;

               (iii)By  Buyer  upon a  material  breach  of any  representation,
                    warranty,  covenant or  agreement  on the part of Seller set
                    forth in this Agreement; or

               (iv) By Seller  upon a  material  breach  of any  representation,
                    warranty,  covenant  or  agreement  on the part of Buyer set
                    forth in this Agreement.

          (b) In the event of the  termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant  to
     subparagraph  (iii) or (iv) above because Seller or Buyer,  as the case may
     be,  shall have  willingly or in bad faith failed to satisfy a condition to
     the  Closing,  the other party shall be entitled to pursue,  exercise,  and
     enforce any and all remedies,  rights,  powers, and privileges available to
     it at law or in equity.

     <b>Section 13.12.</b> <b><u>Public Announcements</u>.</b>  Buyer and Seller will coordinate with
each other  regarding the content and timing of the initial public  announcement
of,  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement.   Buyer  and  Seller
acknowledge  and  consent  that each may issue a press  release  concerning  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  so long  as such  press  release
contains substantially the same information as set forth on <u>Schedule 13.12</u>.
