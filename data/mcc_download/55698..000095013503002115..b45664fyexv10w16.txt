                               EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT


This Agreement is made as of the 12th day of January, 2003 (the "Effective
Date") by and between Barry Boehme ("I") and THE FIRST YEARS INC. (the
"Company").

In consideration of my employment with the Company, its subsidiaries,
affiliates, successors, or assigns, and the compensation hereafter paid to me by
the Company, I agree as follows:

1) I recognize that during my employment with the Company I will receive,
   develop, or otherwise acquire information which is of a confidential or
   secret nature. Except as authorized in writing by the Company, I will not
   disclose or use, directly or indirectly, during or after my employment with
   the Company, any information of the Company which I obtain during the course
   of my employment, including information relating to inventions, products,
   product specifications, processes, procedures, machinery, apparatus, prices,
   discounts, manufacturing costs, business affairs, future business or product
   plans, ideas, technical data, the Company's customers, sources of supply,
   planned advertising, promotion or marketing, or other information which is of
   a secret or confidential nature, whether or not acquired or developed by me.
   My obligation under this paragraph shall not apply to information known by me
   prior to my employment with the Company, information generally known in the
   Company's field of business, information known to others hereafter without
   fault by me, or information disclosed to me by a third party without
   restriction and without breach of obligation to the Company.

2) I will communicate to the Company promptly and fully all discoveries,
   improvements, and inventions (hereinafter called "inventions") and all
   writings, drawings, and other works of authorship (hereinafter called "works
   of authorship") made or conceived or created or authored by me (either solely
   or jointly with others) during my employment and, as to inventions, for six
   months thereafter which are along the lines of the actual or anticipated
   business, work, or investigations of the Company or which result from or are
   suggested by any work I may do for the Company; and such inventions, whether
   patented or not, and works of authorship and any copyrights therein, arising
   from my employment shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the
   Company or its nominees.

3) I will, during my employment, keep and maintain adequate and current written
   records of all such inventions and works of authorship, in the form of notes,
   drafts, layouts, sketches, drawings, reports and the like relating thereto,
   which records shall be and remain the property of and available to the
   Company at all times.

4) I will, during and after my employment with the Company, without charge to
   the Company, but at its request and expense, assist the Company and its
   nominees in every proper way to obtain and vest in it or them title to, and
   to maintain and support the validity of, patents and copyrights on the
   inventions and works of authorship referred to in paragraph 2, above, in all
   countries by executing all necessary or desirable documents, including
   applications for patents and copyrights, assignments thereof, assignments of
   priority rights thereof and such other lawful documents as may be requested,
   and I agree to do such other lawful acts as may be requested for said
   purposes.

5) Upon the termination of my employment by the Company, I agree to deliver to
   the Company all property of the Company, including all documents and things
   evidencing or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and including
   without limitation, the documents referred to in Paragraph 3 above.

6) During the course of my employment by the Company, and for a period of 12
   months after the termination of my employment by the Company for any reason
   whatsoever, I shall not engage or become interested, directly or indirectly,
   as an employee, owner, consultant, officer, director or partner, through
   stock ownership, investment of capital, lending of money or property,
   rendering of services or otherwise, either alone or in association with
   others, in the operation of any type of business or enterprise competitive
   with the Company's business of developing, marketing, and distributing
   products for infants, toddlers, and young children (a "competitor company,")
   regardless of where such competitor company sells its products or where such
   competitor company is located.
<PAGE>
7) My holding (individually or otherwise) of any investment in any business or
   enterprise other than the Company shall not be deemed to be a violation of
   Paragraph 6 if such investment does not constitute over 5% of the outstanding
   issue of such security, and I do not otherwise accept employment with, act as
   a consultant to, become an officer, director, or partner of, or otherwise
   become actively associated with the issuer of such security.

8) I recognize, acknowledge and agree that the foregoing limitations of
   Paragraphs 6 and 7 are reasonable and properly required for the adequate
   protection of the Company's business and do not preclude me from pursuing my
   livelihood. However, if any such limitation is found by any court of
   competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a
   period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a
   geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum
   period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be
   enforceable.

9) In further consideration of my services and the agreement not to compete set
   forth in Paragraph 6, the Company agrees that in the event the Company
   terminates my employment for any reason (other than in the event of my death,
   Disability, or for Cause as defined in Paragraph 10 below), then the Company
   (1) will continue to pay me my base salary (then in effect) for a twelve (12)
   month period (to be paid in twenty-six (26) equal bi-weekly installments),
   reduced by the amount, if any, that I earn from other employment during such
   12-month period; and (2) continue to provide the medical and dental benefits
   (then in effect) via COBRA at the Company's expense for the same 12-month
   period, provided I continue to comply with my obligations under Paragraphs 1
   (one) through 7(seven) plus 11 (eleven) during such 12-month period.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, I will not participate in the Company's Annual
   Incentive Plan, 1993 Equity Incentive Plan (or similar cash-based or
   equity-based bonus plans then in effect for executive officers), or
   Pension/401K Plans during such 12-month post-employment period. Although I am
   not under any obligation to seek new employment, in the event I do obtain new
   employment during such 12-month period, the Company will cease providing the
   benefits on the day I obtain new employment. In the event I leave the employ
   of the Company voluntarily, no severance payments and/or benefits will be
   paid to me by the Company.


10)Termination for Cause for purposes of this Agreement shall be limited to
   termination for: (i) My gross, willful, and deliberate failure to perform a
   substantial portion of my duties hereunder for reasons other than disability,
   which failure continues for more than sixty (60) days after the Company gives
   written notice to me, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such
   failure; or (ii) conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction
   which is upheld upon appeal to a higher court, or upon the lapse of an appeal
   period if no appeal is taken from such conviction.

   a) Disability, for purposes of this Agreement, shall be limited to the
      following situations: (1) If I suffer any illness, disability, or
      incapacity which prevents me from substantially performing my duties, and
      such illness, disability or incapacity shall be deemed by a duly-licensed
      physician (who may be my personal physician) to be permanent; or (2) I am
      unable to substantially perform my duties for a period of twelve (12)
      consecutive months by reason of illness, disability, or incapacity, and
      the Board, by majority vote of its members, determines that I am
      permanently disabled.

11)During the course of my employment with the Company and for a period of
   twelve (12) months following termination of my employment, I will not, either
   individually or on behalf of or through any third party, directly or
   indirectly, hire, retain, entice, solicit or encourage any Company employee
   or consultant to leave the Company, nor will I directly or indirectly, be
   involved in the hiring, retaining or recruitment of any Company employee or
   consultant. This provision shall prohibit the aforesaid activities by me with
   respect to any person both while such person is an employee or consultant of
   the Company, and for ninety (90) days thereafter.


12)If I violate any provisions of this Agreement, then the time limitations set
   forth in this Agreement shall be extended for a period of time equal to the
   period of time during which such breach occurs and, in the event the Company
   is required to seek relief from such breach before any court, board, or other
   tribunal, then the time limitation shall be extended for a period of time
   equal to the pendency of such proceedings, including all appeals.
<PAGE>
13)I acknowledge that any breach of this Agreement by me may give rise to
   irreparable injury to the Company, which may not be adequately compensated by
   damages. Moreover, I acknowledge that to the extent that any breach of this
   Agreement by me may give rise to injury to the Company, which may be
   adequately compensated by damages, such damages are difficult or impossible
   to calculate. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of
   Paragraphs 1 through 7 of this Agreement by me, the Company shall have, in
   addition to any remedies it may have at law, the right to an injunction or
   other equitable relief to prevent the violation of its rights hereunder.


14)

   a) The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
      shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of
      this Agreement.

   b) This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements, written or oral,
      between the Company and me relating to the subject matter of this
      Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified, changed or discharged in
      whole or in part, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Company
      and me. This Agreement shall be binding upon me and my heirs and personal
      representatives, and shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its
      successors, assigns and nominees, provided that Paragraph 1 above shall be
      binding upon such heirs and personal representatives only to the extent
      that they obtain from me confidential information of the Company.

   c) No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this
      Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver
      or consent given by the Company on any one occasion is effective only in
      that instance and shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any
      right on any other occasion.

   d) I expressly consent to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement for
      the benefit of the Company or any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate
      thereof, without the necessity for any separate execution of this
      Agreement in favor of such parent, subsidiary, or affiliate.

   e) This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts, without giving effect to conflict of laws provisions
      thereof.
