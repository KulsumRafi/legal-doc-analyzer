                                THIRD AMENDMENT
                                     TO THE
                          LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

      THIS THIRD AMENDMENT (this "Amendment") is made August 28, 2002 by and
between GOLDEN EAGLE LEASING, INC., an Arizona corporation ("Borrower"), and
WEBSTER BANK, a federally chartered savings bank ("Lender").

                                   Background

      A. Lender has extended a revolving credit loan in the maximum amount of
$15,000,000 (the "Loan") to Borrower pursuant to the terms of that certain Loan
and Security Agreement by and between Lender and Borrower dated August 24, 2001
as amended by that certain First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement by and
between Lender and Borrower dated September 19, 2001, that certain Second
Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement by and between Lender and Borrower
dated March 28, 2002 and that certain letter agreement by and among Lender,
Borrower and Guarantor dated August 22, 2002 (collectively, the "Loan
Agreement").

      B. The Loan is evidenced by that certain Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit Note dated March 28,2002 in the original principal amount of $15,000,000
(the "Note"). The indebtedness of the Note is secured by Borrower's grant to
Lender of a security interest in the Collateral, as such term is defined in the
Loan Agreement.

      C. The Loan has been guarantied by Hypercom Corporation, the Borrower's
parent corporation, pursuant to that certain Guaranty dated as of August 24,
2001 as reaffirmed by that certain Reaffirmation of Guaranty dated March 28,
2002 (collectively, the "Guaranty" and together with the Loan Agreement, the
Note, and all other documents relating thereto, the "Loan Documents").

      D. Borrower has requested that Lender modify the terms of the Loan
Documents to provide for, among other things, an extension of the maturity of
the Loan, a decrease in the Revolving Credit Rate, and a modification of a
financial covenant.

      E. Lender has agreed to Borrower's request, subject to the terms and
conditions contained in this Amendment.

                                   Agreement

      In consideration of the Background, which is incorporated by this
reference, other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is acknowledged, and the mutual promises and covenants contained in this
Amendment, the parties, intending to be bound legally, agree as follows:

      "Stated Expiry Date" shall mean February 24, 2004.

      3. Reduction of the Revolving Credit Rate.

            (a) The Revolving Credit Rate set forth in the Transaction Summary
forming a part of Recital A of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to read as
follows:

      Revolving Credit Rate: The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus one and one
      quarter percent (1.25%) or 30 day LIBOR plus four hundred (400) basis
      points.

            (b) Section 2.5(a) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as
follows:

      2.5 Interest. (a) Borrower shall pay interest to Lender on each Revolving
      Credit Advance at the rate set forth in (i) or (ii) below as elected by
      Borrower at the time the Revolving Credit Advance is requested (the
      "Revolving Credit Rate") provided that (A) no more than fifty percent
      (50%) of the aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Credit Advances
      may bear interest pursuant to (i) below at any time; (B) each Revolving
      Credit Advance for which the Revolving Credit Rate set forth in (i) below
      is elected must be in the amount of no less than one hundred thousand
      dollars ($100,000); (C) Borrower may have no more than five (5) Revolving

      (i) below outstanding at any time; and (D) at the option of the Lender the
      rate described in (i) below shall no longer be available following the
      occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder:

      (i) A rate per annum (the "Revolving LIBOR-Based Rate") equal to the sum
      of London InterBank Offering Rate available to Lender for U.S.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

      dollar thirty-day deposits, plus four hundred (400) basis points, such
      Revolving LIBOR-Based Rate to be further adjusted to compensate Lender for
      all applicable reserve requirements imposed upon Lender in respect of
      LIBOR investments as determined by Lender at the time of such advance and
      at the end of each successive 30 day period thereafter (each an "Interest
      Period"). Each such rate shall remain in effect for the entire Interest
      Period until redetermined for the next successive Interest Period; or

      the "Prime Rate" as published in the section of the Wall Street Journal

      and one quarter percent (1.25%). The Revolving Prime-Based Rate will
      change automatically and immediately as of the date of a change in the
      Prime Rate, without notice to the Borrower.

      Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, but shall be
      computed for the actual number of days in each period for which interest
      is charged. With respect to a Revolving Prime-Based Rate, interest shall
      be payable monthly in arrears on the first Business Day of each month.
      With respect to a Revolving LIBOR-Based Rate, interest shall be payable,
      in arrears, on the first Business Day following the expiration of the

      interest on the Revolving Credit Loan shall be payable on the Commitment
      Termination Date, and if any interest accrues or remains payable after the
      Commitment Termination Date, upon demand by Lender.

      4. Modification of Financial Covenant.

            Section 5.2(a) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:

      (a) Total Liabilities/Tangible Net Worth Ratio. Borrower shall maintain a
      ratio of total liabilities (adding any contingent liabilities of the
      Borrower arising from the sale of any Leases) to Tangible Net Worth of no
      greater than (i) 15.0:1.0 as of the end of each Fiscal Quarter of the
      Borrower, beginning with the Fiscal Quarter ending September 30, 2001
      through and including the Fiscal Quarter ending June 30, 2002; and (ii)
      2.25:1.0 as of the end of each Fiscal Quarter of the Borrower thereafter,
      beginning with the Fiscal Quarter ending September 30, 2002.

      5. Limitation on Indebtedness.

            (a) The following is hereby added as Section 6(l) of the Loan
Agreement:

      (l) Create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Indebtedness that would
      cause


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         (i) Borrower's total outstanding Lease Financing to exceed
         $40,000,000.00,

         (ii) total Lease Financing available to Borrower, including, without
         limitation amounts outstanding and amounts unadvanced under existing
         facilities or transactions, whether committed, discretionary or
         otherwise, to exceed $45,000,000.00, or

         (iii) Borrower's Indebtedness other than (w) Lease Financing, (x) other
         Indebtedness of the Borrower disclosed in the Financial Statements
         delivered by Borrower to Lender pursuant to Section 5.1(c) hereof for
         the Fiscal Month ended June 30, 2002, (y) intercompany Indebtedness
         owed by Borrower to Hypercom up to a maximum of $7,500,000.00, all of
         which is fully subordinate to the Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to
         that certain Subordination Agreement of Hypercom dated August 24, 2002,
         and (z) Indebtedness incurred in connection with the implementation of
         Borrower's new lease tracking and general ledger system (i.e.
         "Leaseworks") up to a maximum of $700,000.00 (such amount to be in
         addition to the approximately $391,000.00 in Indebtedness already
         incurred for such purpose), to exceed $500,000.00,

      in any such case without the prior written consent of the Lender. As used
      herein, the term Lease Financing means the Obligations and other so called
      asset based loans and extensions of credit (A) similar in structure and
      terms to the Revolving Credit Loan, (B) secured solely by assets meeting
      the definition of Leases in Section 1(bq) hereof (other than
      identification on a Lease Certificate), (C) in which the total amount
      advanced and permitted to remain outstanding is limited to a percentage of
      the value of such collateral, and (D) having advance rates and collateral
      eligibility criteria substantially similar to those contained herein. For
      the purposes of this Section 6(l), Borrower's Lease Financing shall be
      determined exclusive of the existing Indebtedness of Borrower as
      evidenced in part by those certain Contract Backed Term Notes of Borrower
      payable to the order of United of Omaha Life Insurance Company, Teachers'
      Insurance and Annuity Association of America and Sigler & Co. dated May
      24, 2001, in the aggregate original principal amount of $31,960,044.00 and
      having an aggregate current principal balance of $16,253,189.34.

            (b) Section 1(bz) of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as
follows:

      which Borrower or any other Credit Party operates, (b) Borrower's or any
      other Credit Party's ability to pay or perform the Obligations under the
      Loan Documents to which such Credit Party is a party in accordance with
      the terms thereof, (c) the Collateral or Lender's Liens on the Collateral
      or the priority of any such Lien, or (d) Lender's rights and remedies
      under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Material Adverse Effect

      liability (other than Indebtedness permitted by Section 6(c) or Section
      6(l) and reasonable and customary business expenses incurred in the
      ordinary course of business), contingent or liquidated, which has an
      actual or estimated incurrence of liability, or dollar exposure or loss,
      greater than $100,000.

      reconciliation of the lease loss reserve in form, scope, substance and
      level of detail acceptable to the Lender, reconciling the Borrower's
