<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Company has granted the Hilton Hotels Pension and Thrift Committee (the "Committee") the authority to adopt amendents to the Plan on behalf of the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company wishes to amend the Plan provisions applicable to the determination of Years of Vesting Service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the Plan is amended as follows effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2003; such amendment shall apply only to individuals who are Participants under the Plan on or after the

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(g)
In the case of an Employee whose Compensation is determined on the basis of an hourly rate, the number of hours to be credited to the Employee in a Vesting Computation Period solely
for the purpose of determining Years of Vesting Service will be determined on the basis of Compensation, if: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Employee is credited with the number of hours equal to: the total of the Employee's Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period divided by the Employee's
hourly rate as in effect at such times during the Vesting Computation Period; or the Employee's total Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period divided by the Employee's lowest hourly rate
during the Vesting Computation Period, or by the lowest hourly rate payable to an Employee in the same or a similar job classification reasonably defined; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;870&nbsp;hours
credited under paragraph&nbsp;(1) of this subsection (g)&nbsp;are treated as equivalent to 1,000 Hours of Service, and 435&nbsp;hours credited
under paragraph&nbsp;(1) above are treated as equivalent to 500 Hours of Service. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>For
purposes of this subsection (g), Compensation at premium rates for overtime will be divided by the Employee's hourly rate for overtime, rather than the regular time hourly rate. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the case of an Employee whose Compensation is determined on a basis other than an hourly rate, hours to be credited to the Employee in a Vesting Computation Period

Employee is credited with the number of hours equal to the Employee's total Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period divided by the Employee's lowest
hourly rate of Compensation during the Vesting Computation Period, determined under subsection (i)&nbsp;below; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;750&nbsp;hours
credited under paragraph&nbsp;(1) of this subsection (h)&nbsp;are treated as equivalent to 1,000 Hours of Service, and 375&nbsp;hours credited

the case of an Employee whose Compensation is determined on the basis of a fixed rate for a specified period of time (other than an hour) such as a day, week or
month, the Employee's hourly rate of Compensation shall be the Employee's lowest rate of Compensation during a Vesting Computation Period for such specified period of time divided by the number of
hours regularly scheduled for the performance of duties during such period of time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of an Employee without a regular work schedule, the Employee's
hourly rate of Compensation shall be calculated on the basis of a 40-hour workweek or an 8-hour workday, or any other reasonable basis which reflects the average hours worked
by the Employee over a representative period of time, provided that the basis so used is consistently applied to all Employees within the same job classifications reasonably defined. </FONT></P>

the case of an Employee whose Compensation is not determined on the basis of a fixed rate for a specified period of time, the Employee's hourly rate of Compensation
shall be the lowest hourly rate of Compensation payable to Employees in the same job classification as the Employee, or, if no Employees in the same job classification have an hourly rate, the minimum
wage as established from time to time under Section&nbsp;6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. </FONT></P>
