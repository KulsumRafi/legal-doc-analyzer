                  discretion, the Bank's Board of Directors may increase the
                  annual benefit under this Section 2.3.1, but any increase

                  Benefit amount to the Executive in 12 equal monthly
                  installments on the first day of each month. The annual
                  benefit shall be paid to the Executive for 15 years.

         2.4 Change-in-Control Benefit. If the Executive's employment with the
Bank terminates involuntarily within 12 months after a Change in Control, or if
the Executive terminates employment voluntarily for Good Reason within 12 months
after a Change in Control, the Bank shall pay to the Executive the benefit
described in this Section 2.4 instead of any other benefit under this Agreement.
However, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement if the Executive's
employment is terminated under Article 5 of this Agreement.

         2.4.1    Amount of Benefit. The benefit under this Section 2.4 is
                  determined by vesting the Executive in the Normal Retirement
                  Age Accrual Balance ($687,377) required by Section 2.1,
                  without reduction for the time value of money or other
                  discount. In its sole discretion, the Bank's board of
                  directors may increase the benefit under this Section 2.4.1,
                  but any increase shall require recalculation of Schedule A.

                  Termination of Employment.

         2.5 Petition for Payment of Vested Normal Retirement Benefit, Vested
Early Termination Benefit or Vested Disability Benefit. If the Executive is
entitled to the normal retirement benefit provided by Section 2.1, the Early
Termination benefit provided by Section 2.2, or the Disability benefit provided

Accrual Balance amount corresponding to that particular benefit paid to the
Executive in a single lump sum after (1) deduction of any normal retirement
benefits, Early Termination benefits or Disability benefits already paid and (2)
addition of interest at the rate of 7.0% on the Accrual Balance not yet paid for
the period from Termination of Employment to payment of the lump sum amount. The
board of directors shall have sole and absolute discretion about whether to pay
the remaining Accrual Balance in a lump sum. If payment of the remaining Accrual
Balance is paid in a single lump sum, the Bank shall have no further obligations
under this Agreement.

         2.6 Change-in-Control Payout of Vested Normal Retirement Benefit,
Vested Early Termination Benefit or Vested Disability Benefit Being Paid to the
Executive at the Time of a Change in Control. If a Change in Control occurs at
any time during the entire 15-year salary continuation benefit payment period
and if at the time of that Change in Control the Executive is receiving the
benefit provided by Section 2.1.2, Section 2.2.2, or Section 2.3.2, the Bank
shall pay the remaining salary continuation benefits to the Executive, the
Executive's beneficiaries, or the Executive's estate in a lump sum within three
days after the Change in Control. The lump-sum payment due to the Executive,
beneficiaries, or estate as a result of a Change in Control shall be an amount
equal to the Accrual Balance amount corresponding to that particular benefit
then being paid to the Executive, beneficiaries, or estate under Section 2.1.2,
Section 2.2.2, or Section 2.3.2 after (1) deduction of any normal retirement
benefits, Early Termination benefits, or Disability benefits already paid and

for the period from Termination of Employment to payment of the lump sum amount.

         2.7 Contradiction in Terms of Agreement and Schedule A. If there is a
contradiction in the terms of this Agreement and the Schedule A attached hereto
concerning the benefits due under Section 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 hereof, then the
actual amount of benefits prescribed by this Agreement shall control.

instead of any benefit payable under this Agreement the Bank shall pay to the
Executive's beneficiary(ies) the benefit described in the Executive Survivor
Income Agreement attached to this Agreement as Addendum A.

         3.2 Death During Benefit Period. If the Executive dies after benefit
payments under Article 2 of this Agreement have commenced but before receiving

beneficiary(ies) at the same time and in the same amounts they would have been
paid to the Executive had the Executive survived.

         3.3 Death After Termination of Employment But Before Benefit Payments

after the date of the Executive's death. Payments shall be made in the same
amounts they would have been paid to the Executive had the Executive survived.

         3.4 Petition for Benefit Payments. If the Executive dies before
receiving any or all benefit payments to which he or she is entitled under
Section 2.1, Section 2.2, or Section 2.3, the Executive's beneficiary(ies) or
estate may petition the Board of Directors to have the Accrual Balance
corresponding to that particular benefit paid to the Executive's
beneficiary(ies) or estate in a single lump sum after (1) deduction of any
normal retirement benefits, Early Termination benefits, or Disability benefits
already paid and (2) addition of interest at the rate of 7.0% on the Accrual
Balance not yet paid for the period from the Executive's Termination of
Employment to payment of the lump sum amount. The board of directors shall have
sole and absolute discretion about whether to pay the remaining Accrual Balance
in a lump sum. If payment of the remaining Accrual Balance is paid in a single
lump sum, the Bank shall have no further obligations under this Agreement.

Section 2.1.2, Section 2.2.2, or Section 2.3.2, the Bank shall pay the remaining
salary continuation benefits to the Executive's beneficiaries or estate in a
lump sum within three days after the Change in Control. The lump-sum payment due

shall be an amount equal to the Accrual Balance amount corresponding to that
particular benefit then being paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiaries

Executive's beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the
beneficiary predeceases the Executive, or if the Executive names a spouse as
beneficiary and the marriage is subsequently dissolved. If the Executive dies
without a valid beneficiary designation, all payments shall be made to the
Executive's estate.

                  claim, the Bank shall notify the claimant in writing of such
                  denial. The Bank shall write the notification in a manner
                  calculated to be understood by the claimant. The notification

                  6.1.3.5  A statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil
                           action under ERISA (Employees Retirement Income
                           Security Act) Section 502(a) following an adverse
                           benefit determination on review.

         6.2 Review Procedure. If the Bank denies part or all of the claim, the
claimant shall have the opportunity for a full and fair review by the Bank of
the denial, as follows:

         6.2.1    Initiation - Written Request. To initiate the review, the
                  claimant, within 60 days after receiving the Bank's notice of
                  denial, must file with the Bank a written request for review.

         6.2.2    Additional Submissions - Information Access. The claimant
                  shall then have the opportunity to submit written comments,
                  documents, records and other information relating to the
                  claim. The Bank shall also provide the claimant, upon request
                  and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all
                  documents, records and other information relevant (as defined
                  in applicable ERISA regulations) to the claimant's claim for
                  benefits.

         6.2.3    Considerations on Review. In considering the review, the Bank
                  shall take into account all materials and information the
                  claimant submits relating to the claim, without regard to
                  whether such information was submitted or considered in the
                  initial benefit determination.

         6.2.4    Timing of Bank Response. The Bank shall respond in writing to
                  such claimant within 60 days after receiving the request for
                  review. If the Bank determines that special circumstances
                  require additional time for processing the claim, the Bank can
                  extend the response period by an additional 60 days by
                  notifying the claimant in writing, prior to the end of the
                  initial 60-day period, that an additional period is required.
                  The notice of extension must set forth the special
                  circumstances and the date by which the Bank expects to render
                  its decision.

         6.2.5    Notice of Decision. The Bank shall notify the claimant in
                  writing of its decision on review. The Bank shall write the
                  notification in a manner calculated to be understood by the
                  claimant. The notification shall set forth:

                  6.2.5.1  The specific reasons for the denial,

                  6.2.5.2  A reference to the specific provisions of the
                           Agreement on which the denial is based,

                  6.2.5.3  A statement that the claimant is entitled to receive,
                           upon request and free of charge, reasonable access
                           to, and copies of, all documents, records and other
                           information relevant (as defined in applicable ERISA
                           regulations) to the claimant's claim for benefits,
                           and

                  6.2.5.4  A statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil
                           action under ERISA Section 502(a).

                                   Article 7
                                  Miscellaneous

         7.1 Amendments and Termination. This Agreement may be amended or
terminated only by a written agreement signed by the Bank and the Executive.

         7.2 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall bind the Executive and the
Bank, and their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, successors, administrators
and transferees.

         7.3 No Guarantee of Employment. This Agreement is not an employment
policy or contract. It does not give the Executive the right to remain an
employee of the Bank, nor does it interfere with the Bank's right to discharge
the Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee nor
interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any time.

                                       7

         7.4 Non-Transferability. Benefits under this Agreement cannot be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, attached, or encumbered in any manner.

         7.5 Successors; Binding Agreement. By an assumption agreement in form
and substance satisfactory to the Executive, the Bank will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Bank to expressly
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Bank would be required to perform this Agreement if no such
succession had occurred. The Bank's failure to obtain such an assumption
agreement before the succession becomes effective shall be considered a breach
of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to the Change-in-Control
benefit provided in Section 2.4.

         7.6 Tax Withholding. The Bank shall withhold any taxes that are
required to be withheld from the benefits provided under this Agreement.

         7.7 Applicable Law. Except to the extent preempted by the laws of the
United States of America, the validity, interpretation, construction, and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Oregon, without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws of such state.

         7.8 Unfunded Arrangement. The Executive and the Executive's
beneficiary(ies) are general unsecured creditors of the Bank for the payment of
benefits under this Agreement. The benefits represent the mere promise by the
Bank to pay such benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner
to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
attachment, or garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life
is a general asset of the Bank to which the Executive and beneficiary(ies) have
no preferred or secured claim.

         7.9 Administration. The Bank shall have the powers that are necessary
to administer this Agreement, including but not limited to the power to:

                  (a) interpret the provisions of the Agreement,

                  (b) establish and revise the method of accounting for the
                  Agreement,

                  (c) maintain a record of benefit payments, and

                  (d) establish rules and prescribe forms necessary or desirable
                  to administer the Agreement.

         7.10 Named Fiduciary. The Bank shall be the named fiduciary and plan
administrator under this Agreement. The named fiduciary may delegate to others
certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the plan,
including the employment of advisors and the delegation of ministerial duties to
qualified individuals.

         7.11 Severability. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement, and each such other provision shall continue in full force and effect
to the full extent consistent with law. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid in part, such invalidity shall in no way affect the remainder of
the provision, and the remainder of such provision, together with all other
provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect to the full
extent consistent with law.

         7.12 Headings. The headings of sections herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision of this Agreement.
