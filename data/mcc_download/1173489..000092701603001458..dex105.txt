preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

the time for performance of any act or condition hereunder does not constitute

   SECTION 3.8. Successors; No Assignment.  Each Party agrees that it will not
assign, sell, delegate, or otherwise transfer, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, any right or obligation under this Agreement, provided, however,

obligations hereunder without such approval in connection with a merger,
reorganization, reincorporation into another state, or sale of all, or

Agreement, if the assignee agrees to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as the Assigning Party. Any
purported assignment, sale, delegation or other transfer in violation of this
Section 3.8 shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing limits on
assignment and delegation, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
