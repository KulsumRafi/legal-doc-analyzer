                                   THE MERGER

     Section 2.01 The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company as the
surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation." The closing of the Merger shall take place at the
offices of Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business
Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 9, or at such other time, date and location as
the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

     (b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Parent
shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective
Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary
of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of
merger).

     (c) From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be
as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. At
such time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers,
privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all
as provided under Delaware Law.

     Section 2.02 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

     (a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.02(b) and 2.05, each share
of Company Stock (along with each Right attached thereto) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the number of American Depositary Shares ("ADSs")
representing shares of Parent Stock equal to a fraction (rounded to the nearest
whole number, with any fraction equal to or higher than one-half rounded up to
the next succeeding whole number), the numerator of which is 41,500,000 and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Merger Consideration");

     (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than shares in an Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons)
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;


                                       7
<PAGE>


     (c) each share of Merger Sub Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Corporation Stock. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Stock shall evidence ownership of
such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

     (d) the Surviving Corporation shall issue shares of Surviving Corporation
Stock to Parent in consideration for Parent issuing Parent Stock in respect of
the ADSs to former stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 2.02(a), the
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Stock issued to Parent pursuant to
this Section 2.02(d) to be equal to the number of shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Stock to which Section 2.02(b) applies).

     Section 2.03 Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") reasonably acceptable to
the Company for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock and the Rights attached
thereto (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock and
the Rights attached thereto (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter
of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

     (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The ADSs
constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parent's option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a
holder of shares of Company Stock or is otherwise required under applicable
law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2.

     (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.


                                       8
<PAGE>


     (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this Article 2.

     (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto,
in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall not be liable to any holder of ADSs or shares of Parent
Stock or Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental authority)
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

     (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.03. Following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the
time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer
and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with
respect to such securities.

     Section 2.04 Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase shares of Company Stock under any stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a "Company Option"), whether
or not exercised or vested, shall be terminated and no consent of any holder of
any stock option or any employee shall be required under any Company stock
option or compensation plan or other arrangement of the Company for such
termination.

     Section 2.05 Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, any stock dividend
thereon or other like change occurs with respect to Parent Stock or the Company
Stock having a record date during such period, the Merger


                                       9
<PAGE>


Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.

     Section 2.06 [Reserved].

     Section 2.07 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. If
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, so
withholds such amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Stock in respect of which the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. Parent and
Merger Sub represent, warrant and agree that no amount will be withheld or
deducted from the Merger Consideration payable to any Person in respect of
Canadian withholding taxes.

     Section 2.08 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article 2.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                           THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

     Section 3.01 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect at the Effective Time shall be
amended in the Merger to be the same as the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Netro
Corporation, and as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law.

     Section 3.02 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable law.

     Section 3.03 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

<PAGE>

     Section 4.04 Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict

both, would become a default) under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled
under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit,
certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating in
any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts and
violations referred to in clause (ii) and for such failures to obtain any such
consent or other action, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations,
changes, losses or Liens referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) that would not
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

     Section 4.05 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 105,000,000 shares consisting of 100,000,000 shares of
Company Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per
share (the "Preferred Stock"), of which 800,000 shares are designated Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). Each
share of Company Stock has attached thereto a right (each, a "Right" and
collectively, the "Rights") to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series
A Preferred Stock at a price of $20 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject
to adjustment. The Rights were issued pursuant to an Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement dated as of July 31, 2002, between the Company and American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"). As of
the close of business on March 24, 2003, there were outstanding 38,700,354
shares of Company Stock and no shares of Preferred Stock and stock options to
purchase an aggregate of 8,597,988 shares (of which options to purchase an
aggregate of 4,792,206 shares were exercisable). All outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued
pursuant to the Employee Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights created under
Delaware Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
agreement or document to which the Company is a party or by which it or its
assets are bound. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, and
Company Options have been issued and granted in compliance with


                                      12
<PAGE>


all applicable securities law and other legal requirements and all requirements
set forth in applicable agreements or instruments. None of the outstanding
Shares is unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition providing that such Shares may be forfeited or repurchased by
the Company or otherwise vest upon termination of stockholder's or grantee's
employment, directorship or other relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the terms of any restricted stock agreement or other
agreement with the Company.

     (b) Except for changes since the close of business on March 24, 2003,
resulting from the issuance of shares of Company Stock pursuant to the ESPP and
from the exercise of Company Options outstanding on such date, there are no (i)
shares of capital stock of or other voting securities or ownership interests in
the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests
in the Company or (iii) options or other rights (including preemptive rights)
to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any capital stock or
other voting securities or ownership interests in or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock or other voting securities or ownership
interests in the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
registration rights and, except for the Rights Agreement, there is no voting
trust, proxy, rights plan, antitakeover plan or other agreement or
understanding to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which it is bound with respect to any Company Securities. Assuming that ADSs
are quoted on Nasdaq at the Effective Time, stockholders of the Company will
not be entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights under applicable state law
in connection with the Merger. There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Securities.

     (c) No shares of Company Stock are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company.

     Section 4.06 Subsidiaries. (a) Schedule 4.06(a) contains a correct and
complete list identifying each of the Company's Subsidiaries, together with a
list of each other entity in which the Company holds (directly or indirectly,
other than through an interest in a mutual fund) an equity interest, whether
voting or otherwise, indicating the name and the Company's equity interest in
such entity. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents
and approvals the absence of which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of or other voting securities or
ownership interests in each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any other
limitation or restriction (including any restriction


                                      13
<PAGE>


on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
voting securities or ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i)
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of or other voting securities or
ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other
rights (including preemptive rights) to acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any capital
stock of or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock of or other
voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the
items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to collectively as the "Company
Subsidiary Securities"). There are no registration rights and there is no
voting trust, proxy, rights plan, antitakeover plan or other agreement or
understanding to which any Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound with
respect to any Company Subsidiary Securities. There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities.

     Section 4.07 SEC Filings. (a) The Company has made available to Parent (i)
the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, (ii) its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for its fiscal
quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, (iii) its

Company held (or actions taken without a meeting by such stockholders) since
December 31, 2000, (iv) all of its other reports, statements, schedules and

(the documents referred to in this Section 4.07(a), collectively, the "Company
SEC Documents"), which are all the reports, statements, schedules and
registration statements required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since
its initial public offering and (v) complete and correct copies of any
correspondence with, and inquiries from the SEC since January 1, 2001 with
respect to the Company SEC Documents.

its terms, and the Company has no Knowledge suggesting other than that all
parties to each material license agreement is in compliance with, and have not
breached any term of any such license agreements in such a manner that would
give rise to a termination right. With respect to each material license
affecting Company Intellectual Property Rights, acquisition of the same through
Merger will not affect the exercise of the rights provided thereunder to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that would be available had the Merger not
occurred, and the acquisition through Merger does not result in payment of any
additional material amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties
or payments which the Company or its Subsidiaries would otherwise be required

Knowledge, all registered or issued Company Intellectual Property Rights on
Schedule 4.21(a) are subsisting, in full force and effect, have not been
cancelled or abandoned, and have not expired. All maintenance and renewal fees

any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights.

Laws. The Company has not made a prospectus offering or a distribution exempt
from the prospectus requirements under Canadian Securities Laws in any

Company as of the date of this Agreement and on reasonable assumptions based on
such information and after consultation with its advisors, the declaration and
payment of the Cash Dividend as of the date of this Agreement would not be

certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not create, and Parent is not a
party to, any shareholder rights plan, poison pill, rights agreement or other
similar plan or agreement.

                            COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

     The Company agrees that:

     Section 6.01 Conduct of the Company. Prior to the date hereof, the Company
has furnished Parent with the previously prepared budget for operating expenses
of the Company, which has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors
(the "Business Plan"). During the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
its terms and the Effective Time, unless Parent shall have otherwise consented
in writing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall conduct their
respective business operations in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice (to the extent contemplated by the Business Plan) and in accordance
with all applicable laws and regulations and pay or provide for all of their
liabilities and obligations (including, without limitation, all customers,
suppliers, licensors, and licensees), in each case, in accordance with the
Business Plan, in an orderly fashion, so as to reasonably maximize the cash and
cash equivalents available to the Surviving Corporation and, to the extent
contemplated by the Business Plan, shall use their commercially reasonably
efforts to preserve intact the Company's and each of its Subsidiaries' business
organizations and relationships. The Company agrees not to materially deviate
from the Business Plan without Parent's advance written approval, including
incurring or paying any expense or liability the amount of which exceeds by
more than $75,000, the amount therefor reflected in the Business Plan, or
expenses or liabilities the aggregate amount of which exceeds by more than
$250,000, the respective amounts therefor reflected in the Business Plan. The
Company agrees to promptly advise Parent in writing of all material
developments relating to the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including resolution of litigation, disposition of tangible and
intangible assets and satisfaction of liabilities. If Parent requests the
written consent of the Company under Section 7.01 prior to taking any action
for which such consent is required thereunder, the Company shall respond to
such request as promptly as practicable and shall not unreasonably withhold
such consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the
prior written consent of Parent, from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries, to:

     (a) adopt or propose any change to its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws;

amount of stock or assets of any other Person;

     (c) incur or pay any fees and expenses of counsel and accountants in
amounts in excess of the sum of (1) $600,000 plus (2) the excess (if any) of
budgeted operating expenses under the Business Plan over actual operating
expenses, to the extent the Company reasonably expects (and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company certifies) that such excess will exist throughout the
period reflected in the Business Plan and on the Closing Date, in the
aggregate, arising out of, or in connection with or related to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;


                                      34

     (d) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any material Subsidiary
or material amount of assets, securities or property except (i) pursuant to
existing contracts or commitments and (ii) in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice or in accordance with the Business Plan;

     (e) (i) take any action that would make any representation and warranty of
the Company hereunder inaccurate in any material respect at, or as of any time
prior to, the Effective Time or (ii) omit to take any action reasonably
necessary to prevent any such representation or warranty from being inaccurate
in any material respect at any such time;

     (f) other than as disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule, waive any
stock repurchase rights, accelerate, amend or change the period of
exercisability of options or restricted stock, or reprice options granted under

payments in exchange for any options granted under any of such plans;

     (g) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
repurchases of unvested shares at cost in connection with the termination of
the employment relationship with any employee pursuant to stock option or
purchase agreements in effect on the date hereof;

     (h) issue, deliver, sell, authorize, pledge or otherwise encumber, or

stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital
stock, or enter into other agreements or commitments of any character
obligating it to issue any such shares or convertible or exchangeable
securities, other than (i) the issuance, delivery, sale of shares of Company
Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options therefor outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement and (ii) the granting of stock options (and the issuance
of Company Stock upon exercise thereof), in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices, in an amount not to exceed options to purchase
(and the issuance of Company Stock upon exercise thereof) 100,000 shares in the
aggregate (provided that, the vesting of these options shall not accelerate
(and these options shall terminate) upon the closing of the Merger);

     (i) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantee any such
indebtedness of another Person, issue or sell any debt securities or options,
warrants, calls or other rights to acquire any debt securities of the Company

aggregate, other than the payment, discharge, settlement or satisfaction, in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices or in accordance
with their terms, of liabilities recognized or disclosed in the most recent
consolidated financial statements (or the notes thereto) of the Company
included in Company SEC Documents or in accordance with the


                                      35
<PAGE>


Business Plan, or (b) waive the benefits of, agree to modify in any manner,

confidentiality or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
beneficiary;

     (k) incur or enter into any agreement, contract or commitment requiring
the Company to pay in excess of $75,000 individually or $250,000 in the
aggregate in any 12 month period other than in the ordinary course of business
or in accordance with the Business Plan;

     (l) grant any severance or termination pay to any employee, except as
required by applicable law or as described on the Company Disclosure Schedule
or pursuant to written agreements in effect or policies existing on the date
hereof and as previously disclosed in writing to Parent or except to
non-executive employees in the ordinary course consistent with past practice,
or adopt any new severance, retention or change in control plan;

     (m) declare, set aside, or pay any dividends on or make any other
distributions (whether in cash, stock, equity securities or property) in
respect of any capital stock or split, combine or reclassify any capital stock
or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in
lieu of or in substitution for any capital stock; and

     (n) except as set forth in Section 4.20, the Company shall not redeem the
Rights or terminate the Rights Agreement prior to the Effective Time;

provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from declaring and paying, and the Company hereby
agrees to declare and pay (subject to permissibility under applicable law) a
cash dividend (the "Cash Dividend") in respect of each outstanding share of
Company Stock in an amount equal to a fraction (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), the numerator of which shall be $100,000,000 and the denominator of
which shall be the number of outstanding shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such dividend to be segregated and set
aside immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to each share of
Company Stock outstanding on the record date for such dividend (which shall be
the Closing Date) and distributed to the holders of such shares promptly
following the Effective Time.

     Section 6.02 Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cause a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as
soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting on the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. Except as permitted by Section
6.03(b), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
will take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote
or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law
to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Company Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of
the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the


                                      36
<PAGE>


Company Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall
ensure that the Company Stockholder Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held
and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with
the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Delaware Law,
the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq and
all other applicable legal requirements. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company's obligation to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with this
Section 6.02 shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or of any Change of Recommendation (as defined herein) and the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or
propose to do so.

     Section 6.03 No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) Until the earlier of the
Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants
or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
induce or take any action to facilitate or encourage any inquiry with respect
to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
inquiries or effort by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, or
that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iv) authorize, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
Liquidation Alternative (except to the extent permitted pursuant to Section
6.03(b)(iii)), or (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement constituting, contemplating or related to, or an agreement
that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal.

     (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if and only if none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries nor any of their officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors,
directly or indirectly, shall have breached any of the restrictions or the
obligations under this Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may
(i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to
the Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors reasonably
believes (considering advice from Davis Polk & Wardwell, outside legal counsel
to the Company, and Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisor to the Company)
will (x) lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) is from a Person reasonably
capable of consummating such Acquisition Proposal; (ii) in the case of such
Acquisition Proposal referred to in Section 6.03(b)(i), furnish to such Third
Party nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less


                                      37
<PAGE>


favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and terms which shall not include any provision calling for an exclusive right
to negotiate with such Third Party or having the effect of prohibiting the
Company from satisfying its obligations hereunder (a copy of which shall be
provided for informational purposes only to Parent); provided that,
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Third
Party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); (iii) following
receipt of a Superior Proposal or a determination that a Superior Alternative
exists, fail to make, withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation to its stockholders ("Change of Recommendation"); provided that,
(A) the Company Stockholder Meeting has not occurred, (B) the Company delivers
to Parent, promptly following the Board of Directors resolution to make the
Change of Recommendation, written notice ("Change of Recommendation Notice") of
the Change of Recommendation, which notice shall state the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal, and the identity of the Third Party making
any Superior Proposal, or, in the case of a Superior Alternative, that such
Superior Alternative exists, (C) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its reasonable judgment by a majority vote, after considering
advice from Davis Polk & Wardwell, outside legal counsel to the Company, and
the Company's financial advisors (including Goldman, Sachs & Co.), that failure
to make a Change of Recommendation would cause the Board of Directors to breach
its fiduciary duties or otherwise be unlawful under applicable law, and (D) for
a period ending at 5:00 p.m. San Francisco time on the third Business Day after
delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto; and/or
(iv) take any non-appealable, final action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under
the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the reasonable judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would breach its obligations under applicable
law.

     (c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection
unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action, and the Company shall
continue to advise Parent after taking such action. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent by 5:00 p.m. San Francisco time on the first Business Day
following receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any indication that any Third Party is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such notice
orally and shall provide such notice in writing in accordance with Section
11.01 hereof and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep Parent fully
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including of any meeting of its
Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the


                                      38
<PAGE>


officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants or other agents or advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Party (or its agents or
advisors) in possession of confidential information about the Company that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such
information.

     Section 6.04 Tax Matters. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall make or change any material Tax election, change any annual
tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any
material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any
material closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim, audit or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset or other
reduction in Tax liability surrendered, consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or
omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the
effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to
be established in accordance with U.S. GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all material Taxes, whether or not shown as being due on
any Tax Return, due with respect to any period ending prior to or as of the
Effective Time.

     (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value
added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger and imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax)
shall be paid by the Company when due, and the Company shall, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

     (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
shall, on or prior to the Effective Time, pay all Taxes, and file all Tax
Returns, directly relating to the Cash Dividend if such payments or filings are
due on or prior to the Effective Time. If any such payment or filing is not due
on or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make such payment or
filing on or before the due date thereof. The Company shall elect to reduce to
zero the amount of federal withholding Tax payable in respect of the Cash
Dividend pursuant to Code Sections 1441, 1442 and 1443 by making the election
provided in Treas. Regulations Section 1.1441-3(c)(2)(i)(C), which election
shall be based on a "reasonable estimate" of the Company's accumulated and
current earnings and profits on the date of payment of the Cash Dividend, as
provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.1441-3(c)(2)(ii).

     Section 6.05 WARN Covenant. The Company shall not, at any time within 90
days before the Closing Date, without complying fully with the notice and other
requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate (i) a "plant closing" as defined in

operating units within any site of employment of the Company; or (ii) a "mass
layoff" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment


                                      39
<PAGE>


of the Company; or any similar action under applicable state or local law
requiring notice to employees in the event of a plant closing or layoff.

     Section 6.06 Termination of Company 401(k) Plan. The Company agrees to
terminate its 401(k) plan, in accordance with reasonable directions from
Parent, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, at which time
participants in the plan will become fully vested in their accounts under such
plan, subject to Parent's agreement in Section 7.05(f).

                                   ARTICLE 7

                       COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

     Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, each agrees that:

     Section 7.01 Conduct of Parent. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Effective Time,
unless Parent shall have otherwise consented in writing, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve intact their business organizations and relationships with third
parties and to keep available the services of their present officers and
employees. If the Company requests the written consent of Parent under Section
6.01 prior to taking any action for which such consent is required thereunder,
Parent shall respond to such request as promptly as practicable and shall not
unreasonably withhold such consent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Company, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries, to:

     (a) adopt or propose any change in its certificate of incorporation,
except that Parent may adopt a new general bylaw to conform to recent
amendments to the CBCA as has been previously disclosed by Parent to the
Company; and

     (b) take any action that would make any representation and warranty of
Parent hereunder inaccurate in any respect at, or as of any time prior to, the
Effective Time;

provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion, repay in whole or
in part C$5,000,000 principal amount (plus interest and other fees due with
respect to such amount) outstanding under Parent's credit facility with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

     Section 7.02 Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

     Section 7.03 Director and Officer Liability. (a) For six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former officer and director of the Company (each an
"Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the confirmation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other applicable laws and in
accordance with the indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof
between the Company and such


                                      40
<PAGE>


Indemnified Person and as provided under the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that, such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under applicable law.

     (b) For three years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers' and directors' liability insurance, to the extent such
insurance can be obtained by the Surviving Corporation using its commercially
reasonable efforts, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement
and the confirmation of the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each
such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount comparable to those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
provided that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.03(b), the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 200%
of the current annual premium therefor, which amount is not more than
$1,200,000, and if such insurance cannot be so maintained at a cost equal to or
less than 200% of the current annual premium, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain as much of such insurance as can be so
maintained at a cost equal to 200% of the current annual premiums of the
Company for such insurance.

     (c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall include provisions for exculpation of director and officer
liability and indemnification that are at least as favorable as those set forth
in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date
hereof. For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws providing for indemnification of Indemnified Persons, with respect to
the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted from time to time under Delaware Law, which provisions
shall not be amended except as required by applicable law or except to make
changes permitted by applicable law that would enlarge the scope of the
Indemnified Persons' indemnification rights thereunder.

     (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.03. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
nothing in this Section 7.03 shall in any way restrict or preclude the sale,
liquidation or dissolution of any Subsidiary of Parent at any time after the
Effective Time.

     (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.


                                      41

     Section 7.04 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the ADSs to be issued in connection with the Merger
to be approved for quotation on Nasdaq and the shares of Parent Stock to be
issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the TSX, subject to, in
the case of Nasdaq, official notice of issuance.

     Section 7.05 Employee Matters. (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain compensation and employee benefits
plans and arrangements for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (other than
equity-based benefits).

     (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors shall
pursuant to Section 19 of the Company's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP"), shorten the Purchase Periods and Offering Periods (each as defined in
the ESPP) then in progress by setting a New Purchase Date (as defined in the
ESPP) that is prior to the Effective Time and notifying all participants in the
ESPP of such New Purchase Date at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the New
Purchase Date, and each participant's option under the ESPP shall be exercised
automatically on the New Purchase Date, unless prior to such date such
participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period, and any Purchase Periods
and Offering Periods then in progress shall end on the New Exercise Date.

     (c) Parent shall, with respect to each employee of the Company that
becomes an employee of Parent (a "Company Employee"), cause such Company
Employee's service with the Company to be recognized as service for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and for purposes of vacation, paid time off and severance,
benefit accrual, in each benefit plan of Parent that is extended to any Company
Employee on or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that such crediting
of service shall not operate to duplicate the payment or funding of any benefit
under such plan.

     (d) Parent shall use its best efforts to cause its benefit plans to waive
any preexisting condition, exclusion or waiting period limitation that was
likewise waived or otherwise satisfied as to each Company Employee under the
terms of any corresponding Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that, the applicable insurance carrier, third party provider or
the like agrees to do so; provided further that, Parent agrees that it will
comply with Section 9801 of the Code with respect to Company Employees.

     (e) For the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2003,
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the severance
policies set forth in Section 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to employees of the Company as of the date hereof and on the terms of
such plans and agreements as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however,
that in no event shall additional severance benefits granted under the
authority of the resolution of the Company Board of Directors as of February
21, 2003 listed on Schedule 4.18(a) exceed $100,000 in the aggregate.

under such plan directly transferred to), and to continue to be eligible to
participate in, a plan or plans qualified under Section 401 of the Code
maintained by Parent after the Effective Time.

<PAGE>


consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property,
or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties
and stock.

and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report

Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as

     Section 8.02 Certain Filings. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the
Company Proxy Statement and the Registration Statements, (ii) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity
is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required
in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statements and seeking on a timely basis to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

     Section 8.03 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult

of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release or
make any such other public statement prior to such consultation. In addition,
the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any documents to be filed with the SEC, or any other public company statements
by the Company, to be made, to the extent such filings or statements contain
information concerning the Company's financial condition or results of
operations, prior to their being publicly filed with the SEC or publicly
released, as the case may be.

     Section 8.04 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the

of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

     Section 8.05 Access to Information. (a) From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to applicable law and the Confidentiality Agreement

<PAGE>


between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company
and Parent shall, upon reasonable notice, (i) give to the other party, its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other

the other party, its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as such party may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its

pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other party. No

opinions or analyses relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, but
without disclosure of identifying information or, except to the extent relating
to such tax structure or tax treatment, any nonpublic commercial or financial
information) on and after the date hereof. Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this agreement, there shall be no limitation on either party's
ability to consult any tax advisor, whether or not independent from the
parties, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment or tax structure of
the transaction.

     Section 8.06 Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company, on the one
hand and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall promptly notify the other
of:

     (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

     (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity or
stock exchange in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

     (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Sections
4.12, 4.13, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19, 5.12, 5.13, 5.15, 5.17 or 5.18, as the case may

Agreement.

affiliates of the Company under Rule 145 of the 1933 Act. As soon as
practicable and, in any event, at least ten days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written
agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, from each Person who
may be so deemed.

     Section 8.09 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Parent Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under such Act, such steps to be taken in
accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC
to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

     Section 8.10 Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. (a) As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall
prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file
the Parent Stock Registration Statement (in which the Company Proxy Statement
shall be included) and the ADS Registration Statement, with the SEC. Each of
Parent and the Company shall provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the
reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statements, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its
counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement and the Registration Statements.
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statements to become effective under the 1933 Act as soon
after such filing as practicable and to keep the Registration Statements
effective (in the case of the Parent Stock Registration Statement, as long as
is necessary to consummate the Merger). The Company Proxy Statement shall
include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, except to the extent
the Board of Directors shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or
recommendation pursuant to Section 6.03(b). Parent and the Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Company stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Parent
Stock Registration Statement becomes effective. Parent and the Company shall
promptly provide to each other copies of, consult with each other regarding and
together prepare written responses with respect to any written comments
received from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statements and shall promptly advise each other of any oral SEC
comments. The Registration Statements and the Company Proxy Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act,
respectively.

     (b) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect
to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the 1933 Act, the
1934 Act, Canadian Securities Laws and applicable foreign or state securities
or "blue sky" laws. Each party hereto shall advise the other, promptly after
receipt of notice thereof, of the time of the effectiveness of the Registration
Statements, the filing of any supplement or amendment thereto, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the qualification of the
ADSs issuable in


                                      46
<PAGE>


connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any
SEC request for amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statements, SEC comments thereon and each party's responses thereto or SEC
request for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Company
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statements shall be filed without the
approval of the parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the
Company should discover any information relating to any party, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statements or the Company Proxy
Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

     Section 8.11 Board of Directors of Parent. Following the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of Parent will take all actions necessary such that one
member of the Company's Board of Directors, designated by the Company and

Directors with a term expiring at the next annual meeting of Parent's
stockholders following the Effective Time and shall include such person in the
slate of nominees recommended by Parent's Board of Directors to the
stockholders of Parent at such annual meeting.

understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
breach by the Company is cured during such 30-day period); and provided
further, that, the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of any of its

its advisors, fails to reaffirm that the declaration and payment of the Cash
Dividend as of the date of the request for such reaffirmation would not be
illegal under applicable law or (ii) the Company, if the Company's Board of
Directors determines in its reasonable judgment, after considering the advice
of its advisors, that the declaration and payment of the Cash Dividend shall
not be permissible under applicable law.

other party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from the
willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to
perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of
such failure. The provisions of this Section 10.02 and Sections 8.03, 11.04,

     Section 11.02 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties and agreements contained herein and in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the
Effective Time, except for those agreements contained herein and any other
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Effective Time (including the provisions regarding director and
officer liability set forth in Section 7.03).

     Section 11.03 Amendments; Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that, after the adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company and without their further
approval, no such amendment or waiver shall reduce the amount or change the
kind of consideration to be received in exchange for any shares of capital
stock of the Company.

     (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

     Section 11.04 Fees; Expenses. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Section, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such cost or expense, whether or not the Merger is
consummated; provided, however that, the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with (i) the printing, filing and mailing to stockholders of the
Company Proxy Statement and the Registration Statements and the solicitation of
the stockholder approval of the Company, and all SEC and other regulatory
filing fees incurred in connection with the Company Proxy Statement and (ii)
the filing fee for the notification and report forms filed with the Federal
Trade Commission and Department of Justice under the HSR Act and premerger
notification and report forms under similar applicable laws of other
jurisdictions, shall be shared equally by the Company and Parent.

     (b) The Company shall pay Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) the amounts set forth below within four Business Days after
any of the following events ("Payment Events"):

          (i) $6,000,000 upon termination of this Agreement for one or more of
     the following reasons: (x) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c), (y) by
     either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) but only if
     there has been a Change of Recommendation or (z) by Parent pursuant to
     Section 10.01(e)(i) (but only if the breach referred to in Section
     10.01(e)(i) is a willful and material breach of a material covenant or
     agreement contained in Article 6 or Article 8 of this Agreement (it being
     understood that no Payment Event shall occur pursuant to this clause
     (b)(i)(z) with respect to any breach of any covenant contained in Section
     6.01(c), 6.01(e), 6.04, 6.05, 6.06 or 8.06 hereof));


                                      53
<PAGE>


          (ii) $2,000,000 upon termination of this Agreement (x) by either
     Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) if there has been
     no Change of Recommendation, (y) by the Company pursuant to Section
     10.01(f)(ii) or (z) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(e)(i) with respect
     to a breach of the covenant contained in Section 6.01(c);

          (iii) in the case of any termination described in Section
     11.01(b)(ii)(x) or (y), if the Company consummates a Qualifying
     Transaction within eighteen (18) months of the termination, concurrently
     with consummation of such Qualifying Transaction, an additional
     $2,500,000, for an aggregate payment under this Section 11.04(b) of
     $4,500,000; provided, however, that if such Qualifying Transaction
     involves the participation of a Third Party (or any of such Third Party's
     Affiliates) who made (directly or indirectly through its Affiliates or
     representatives) an Acquisition Proposal that was publicly announced and
     made known to the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder
     Meeting (whether or not conditional and whether or not such Acquisition
     Proposal shall have been rejected or shall have been withdrawn prior to
     the Company Stockholder Meeting), then the Company shall pay Parent an
     additional $4,000,000 for an aggregate payment under this Section 11.04(b)
     of $6,000,000.

     For purposes of this Section 11.04, a "Qualifying Transaction" means a
transaction whereby, (A) the Company merges with or into, or is acquired,
directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a Third Party (other than
the Company); (B) a Third Party (other than the Company), directly or
indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the total assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up initiated by the Company or any of its officers and directors in
their capacities as such and not including any other Third Party prior to the
time of adoption or implementation of such liquidation, dissolution or winding
up); (C) a Third Party (other than the Company), directly or indirectly,
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Stock; or (D) the
Company adopts or implements a plan of liquidation, recapitalization or share
repurchase at the initiation of, or (prior to the time the Company so adopts or
implements such plan) involving, a Third Party (it being understood that a
liquidation initiated by the Company or any of its officers and directors in
their capacity as such and not involving any other Third Party prior to the
time of adoption or implementation of such liquidation shall not constitute a
Qualifying Transaction) relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or
an extraordinary dividend relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares
of 50% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

     (c) If a Payment Event occurs, the Company shall pay to Parent in
immediately available funds, within four Business Days after submission of
reasonable documentation therefor, an amount equal to all out-of-pocket
expenses and fees actually incurred by Parent arising out of, or in connection
with or related to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, all fees and expenses of agents, counsel, commercial banks,
investment banking firms, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent and
its affiliates if this Agreement is terminated in any of the circumstances set
forth in clauses (i) or (ii) of paragraph (b) above.

     (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount
due to Parent pursuant to this Section 11.04, it shall also pay any costs and
expenses incurred by Parent in connection with any legal actions brought to
enforce this Agreement (including attorney's fee and expenses), together with
interest on the amount of the fees to be paid pursuant to Section 11.04(b) from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

     Section 11.05 Right of First Negotiation and First Refusal. If (x) this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.01 and (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company approves a plan to liquidate, dissolve or wind up the
Company that, prior to the time of such approval, does not involve a Third
Party (other than the Company or its officers or directors in their capacity as
such), then upon the public announcement of such plan the Parent shall have (a)
a right of first negotiation and (b) a right of first refusal with the Company
with respect to the purchase of the Technology from the Company, in each case
for a period ending at 5:00 p.m. San Francisco time on the 45th day following
such announcement (the "Expiration Date"). During such period, the Company
shall be free to negotiate with any prospective transferee to obtain an offer
to purchase the Technology; provided that, such offer must be a bona fide cash
offer from an independent Third Party and must contain customary
representations and warranties, and must not contain any special provisions
which could not be fulfilled by the independent Third Party. If the Company
receives from a prospective transferee such an offer on terms that the Company
is willing to accept, the Company shall provide written notice thereof to
Parent, setting forth the cash price and the other principal terms and
conditions of the proposed transfer. Upon the receipt of such notice, Parent
shall have the right to purchase, at the offered price, the Technology. After
the Expiration Date, Parent shall have no further rights under this Section
11.05 and the Company shall have the ability to sell or transfer the Technology
to any Third Party at any price on any terms or conditions.

     Section 11.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.03,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

     (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to enter into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but any such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

     Section 11.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable conflict of law
principles.

Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts

Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely
