COLOR="#000000">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Overview</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to produce YIG oscillators, synthesizers, and filters based upon the design expertise and manufacturing concepts of Asvan. The Company believes
that the combination of the Company&#146;s strong design, marketing and manufacturing functions in the signal source market with the innovative YIG design expertise of Asvan will result in a strong market entry into the YIG oscillator, synthesizer,
and filter market. The Company intends to commit process, mechanical and electrical design engineering personnel to establish this capacity. Accordingly, the parties intend to close this transaction quickly and to enter the market as quickly as
possible. Upon payment of the purchase price described in Section 4 hereof (the &#147;Purchase Price&#148;) by the Company, Asvan will cause the Assets to be immediately transferred to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

9 below are met, the Company will acquire the Assets by paying the Purchase Price to Asvan at the closing (the &#147;Closing&#148;). Even after the Closing, however, Asvan will retain the right to develop and sell YIG based end item instrument
products pursuant to a grant by the Company of a non-exclusive license to such effect at Closing. Notwithstanding the grant of such non-exclusive license, however, the Company will have the exclusive right after the Closing to sell YIG based
products for use in instrumentation equipment, such as spectrum analyzers, network analyzers and the like to other instrumentation manufacturers. While it is not the present intention of the Company to enter the end item instrumentation market, it
may elect to do so in the future. </FONT></DIV>
