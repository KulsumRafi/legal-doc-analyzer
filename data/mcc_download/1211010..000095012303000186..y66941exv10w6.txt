                                             REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT (the
                                    "Agreement") dated as of November 22,2002,
                                    between UNITED STATES FILTER CORPORATION
                                    ("USF") and NATIONAL WATERWORKS, INC.,
                                    formerly known as Blue Acquisition Corp.
                                    ("NWW').

                  Reference is made to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset
Purchase Agreement") dated as of September 12,2002 among USF, NWW and U.S.
Filter Distribution Group, Inc. ("Distribution") pursuant to which NWW is
acquiring substantially all of the assets of, and certain liabilities of,
Distribution. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have their
respective meanings set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                  USF has heretofore caused the supply and installation bonds
listed on Schedule A-1 hereto (the "Supply Bonds"), the performance bonds listed
on Schedule A-2 hereto (the "Performance Bonds") and the lease guaranties listed
on Schedule A-3 attached hereto (the "Lease Guaranties") to be executed on
behalf of Distribution in favor of the obligees referenced on such schedules.
Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement, USF will remain obligated under the Supply Bonds, Performance Bonds
and Lease Guaranties.

                  Accordingly, USF and NWW agree as follows:

         SECTION 1.  Reimbursement.

         NWW shall reimburse USF for (i) the amount of any claim made by the
issuer of the Supply Bonds and paid by USF and any liability, loss, cost or
expense incurred by USF in connection therewith (each such claim, liability,
loss, cost or expense, a "Supply Bond Obligation"), (ii) the amount of any claim
made by the issuer of the Performance Bonds and paid by USF and any liability,
loss; cost or expense incurred by USF in connection therewith, (each such claim,
liability, loss, cost or expense, a "Performance Bond Obligation"), and (iii)
the amount of any payment made by USF under the Lease Guaranties, and any
liability, loss, cost or expense incurred by USF in connection therewith (each
such claim, liability, loss, cost or expense, a "Lease Guaranty Obligation"), in
each case upon written notification from USF setting forth the amount of the
Supply Bond Obligation, Performance Bond Obligation or Lease Guaranty
Obligation, as the case may be, and documentation evidencing such obligation and
amount.

         SECTION 2.  Letters of Credit.

         On the date hereof NWW is causing UBS AG, Stamford Branch (the "Issuing
Bank") to issue (i) a letter of credit to USF as beneficiary in the amount of
$1,025,758.25 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-l, to secure NWW's
obligations to USF pursuant to Section 1 above with respect to the Supply Bond
Obligations (the "Supply Bond L/C"), (ii) a letter of credit to USF as
beneficiary in the amount of $250,000, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A-2, to secure NWW's obligations to USF pursuant to Section 1 above with respect
to the Performance Bond Obligations (the "Performance Bond L/C"), and (iii) a
letter of credit to USF as beneficiary
<PAGE>
in the amount of $86,531.75, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-3, in each
case to secure NWW's obligations to USF pursuant to Section 1 above with respect
to the Lease Guaranty Obligations (the "Lease Guaranty L/C"). USF shall have the
right to make one or more draws under the Supply Bond L/C, the Performance Bond
L/C or the Lease Guaranty L/C, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the
applicable Supply Bond Obligation, Performance Bond Obligation or Lease Guaranty
Obligation, respectively, if NWW fails to reimburse USF such amounts within 10
business days of receipt of notice given in accordance with Section 1 above.

          SECTION 3. Termination.

         (a) The reimbursement obligations of NWW contained herein with respect
to the Supply Bonds shall terminate at such time as all Supply Bonds have been
terminated or released. Within ten business days of written notice delivered by
NWW to USF of such release or termination of all Supply Bonds, USF shall take
all action reasonably necessary at NWW's cost and expense to terminate the
Supply Bond L/C, including providing written notice of termination to the
Issuing Bank and delivering the original Supply Bond L/C to the Issuing Bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event all Supply Bonds have been
terminated or released but a claim for reimbursement of a Supply Bond is pending
pursuant to Section 1 above, then USF shall take all action reasonably necessary
at NWW's cost and expense to terminate the Supply Bond L/C within ten business
days of resolution of such claim.

         (b) The reimbursement obligations of NWW contained herein with respect
to the Performance Bonds shall terminate at such time as all Performance Bonds
have been terminated or released. Within ten business days of written notice
delivered by NWW to USF of such release or termination of all Performance Bonds,
USF shall take all action reasonably necessary at NWW's cost and expense to
terminate the Performance Bond L/C, including providing written notice of
termination to the Issuing Bank and delivering the original Performance Bond L/C
to the Issuing Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event all Performance
Bonds have been terminated or released but a claim for reimbursement of a
Performance Bond is pending pursuant to Section 1 above, then USF shall take all
action reasonably necessary at NWW's cost and expense to terminate the
Performance Bond L/C within ten business days of resolution of such claim.

         (c) The reimbursement obligations of NWW contained herein with respect
to the Lease Guaranties shall terminate at such time as all Lease Guaranties
have been terminated or released. Within ten business days of written notice
delivered by NWW to USF of such release or termination of all Lease Guaranties,
USF shall take all action reasonably necessary at NWW's cost and expense to
terminate the Lease Guaranty L/C, including providing written notice of
termination to the Issuing Bank and delivering the original Lease Guaranty Bond
L/C to the Issuing Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event all Lease
Guaranties have been terminated or released but a claim for reimbursement of a
Lease Guaranty is pending pursuant to Section 1 above, then USF shall take all
action reasonably necessary at NWW's cost and expense to terminate the Lease
Guaranty L/C within ten business days of resolution of such claim.

         SECTION 4.  Permit Bonds.


                                       2

         NWW has obtained, as of the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the Asset Purchase Agreement, permit bonds to replace the permit bonds listed on
Schedule B attached hereto which USF had caused to be issued on behalf of
Distribution for various obligees on or prior to the closing date of the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Permit Bonds").
NWW shall use its best efforts (apart from commencing litigation), at NWW's cost
and expense, to obtain the release of the Permit Bonds as soon as reasonably
practicable following the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the
Asset Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 5.  Governing Law.

that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
their respective successors and permitted assigns in accordance with Section
10.3(a) of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 9.  Severability.

         In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, no party hereto
shall be required to comply with such provision for so long as such provision is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, but the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby.

         SECTION 10. Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different
parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an
original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this
