<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Executive Cash Bonus Program</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westamerica Bancorporation&#146;s (the Company&#146;s) executive compensation program
includes salary, annual cash bonuses, long-term stock grants, and Company
contributions to non-qualified compensation plans. This description relates to
the annual cash bonus element of that program. Stock grant programs and
non-qualified compensation plans have been approved by shareholders and are
discussed in the &#147;Executive Compensation&#148; and &#147;Other Arrangements&#148; sections of
the Company&#146;s Proxy Statement dated March&nbsp;17, 2003, which has been filed with
the Commission pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;14A.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most senior executives participate in the &#147;Group I&#148; or &#147;Senior Management&#148;
portion of the program. The Group I program includes annual cash bonuses which
are in the range of 35% &#151; 70% of salary if established goals are met. Each
position has a designated target within these ranges, with the CEO having the
highest percentage and other senior managers at lower points in the range.
Other selected senior managers participate in the &#147;Group II&#148; or Management&#148;
portion of this program. The Group II program includes annual cash bonuses
which are targeted in the range of 10% &#151; 30% of salary if established goals are
met.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee Benefits and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
&#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) selects participants for these plans based on
recommendations by the Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;). As part of the
budgeting process, the Board establishes annual corporate performance
objectives. During the first quarter of each year, based on a review with the
CEO of corporate and individual performance for the year just completed, the
Compensation Committee makes the final decision on actual individual cash
bonuses.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual cash bonuses depend on achievement of corporate and other objectives.
Weighting of objectives varies by position, with more weight on corporate
performance for Group I employees. Failure on a significant element of
performance may result in no bonus. This program is established, governed, and
may be modified from time to time by the Compensation Committee.
