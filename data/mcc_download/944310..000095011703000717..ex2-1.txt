                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     3.1 Representations and Warranties of Sellers. Each Seller jointly and
severally represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

          (a) Organization. Each Seller is a limited liability company or

where such qualification is necessary,


                                       4

been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Seller and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller, enforceable against such
Seller in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity. Neither the execution and delivery by Sellers, nor the
consummation or performance by Sellers of any of the transactions to be
consummated or performed by it under this Agreement, will directly or indirectly
(with or without notice or lapse of time): (i) violate or constitute a breach of
any provision of Sellers' limited liability company agreement, limited
partnership agreement or other applicable organization document; (ii) constitute
a violation by Sellers of any applicable judgment, law, statute, ordinance,
regulation, code, rule or order of any governmental authority (collectively,
"Laws"); (iii) conflict with, give rise to a right of acceleration or
termination under, result in any payment or benefit becoming due thereunder,
result in the increase of any payment or benefit due thereunder, result in a

encumbrances of every kind and nature (collectively, "Liens"). It is
acknowledged that Sellers will be required to satisfy and remove any Liens and
purchase any Assets covered by leases at or prior to the Closing.

          (ii) The Assets constitute all the rights, properties, assets and
resources necessary for Purchaser to conduct the Webcasting Business in
substantially the same manner as conducted by Sellers as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date.

satisfactory operating condition and repair and free from any material defects,

functions for which they were intended.

          (iv) EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSETS

Business in the manner required for the normal operation of the Webcasting
Business; Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate to determine the required
number of licenses required by the Purchaser to operate the Webcasting Business
as intended by the Purchaser and the extent to which Purchaser has licenses that
will cover any of the Licensed Software for which a license is not being
transferred. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(e), neither the validity nor

violate any of the Business Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in

infringes upon, misappropriates or violates the Intellectual Property or other
property rights of any other person, and none of Sellers or any affiliate
thereof has received any written notice of any claim or other assertion by any
other person with respect to any of the foregoing. Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will

such Business Intellectual Property. Sellers are in material compliance with all
Contracts entered into with other persons with respect to the Business
Intellectual Property. Each of the Sellers and any applicable affiliate thereof
has taken all commercially reasonable steps (including measures to protect

the "Contracts"), Sellers are not a party or bound by any contract, commitment,
arrangement or plan relating to the Webcasting Business or any of the Assets.
Each Contract disclosed in any Schedule to this Agreement or required to be
disclosed pursuant to this Section is a valid and binding agreement of Sellers
and is in full force and effect, and neither Sellers nor, to the knowledge of
Sellers, any other party thereto is in default or breach in any respect under
the terms of any such Contract, nor, to the knowledge of Sellers, has any event
or circumstance occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute any event of default thereunder. True and complete copies of each
such Contract have been delivered to Purchaser.

          (ii) Except as set forth and described in Schedule 3.1(n)(ii), no
Seller is a party to or bound by any contract, commitment, arrangement or plan
relating to the Webcasting Business or the Assets that limits the freedom of any
Seller to compete in any line of business or with any person or in any area or
to own, operate, sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any

<PAGE>

               (D) Sellers have not received any written notice of a material

length basis.

          (q) Bankruptcy. Upon information and belief of Sellers, the Purchase
Price plus the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities being paid in consideration
for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Assets
constitutes fair consideration and a reasonably equivalent value for the Assets
and the Webcasting Business under the Untied States Bankruptcy Code and the
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and will not constitute a fraudulent
conveyance within the meaning of such or similar Laws to which Sellers are
subject.

          (r) Full Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in
this Section 3.1 do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements and
information contained in this Section 3.1, in light of the circumstances in
which made, not misleading.

Purchaser will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents and approvals of all persons and governmental authorities (including,

contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable insofar as such matters
are within its respective control.

     4.7 Employees.

          (a) On the Closing Date, Sellers shall terminate the employment of
each individual who is an employee of Sellers on the Closing Date and whose name

each of the Employees at the same or higher level of compensation as was made
available to such Employee by Sellers immediately prior to the Closing. Except
as specifically provided herein nothing in this Agreement shall (x) prevent
Purchaser from altering the terms, salary, wages or benefits after the Closing
of any Employee who accepts such offer of employment (each, a "Hired Employee")
or (y) create any obligation on the part of Purchaser to continue the employment
of any Hired Employee for any definite period of time following the Closing. The
Parties acknowledge that Sellers have heretofore disclosed to Purchaser the
levels of compensation and employee benefits made available to the Employees by
Sellers.

          (b) Purchaser further agrees that the Hired Employees shall be
credited for their service with Sellers before the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefits accruals) in the
employee plans provided by Purchaser on and after the Closing Date, including

The Hired Employees' benefits under Purchaser's group health plans shall not be

<PAGE>

to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions and no waiting periods shall
be applicable with respect to the Hired Employees.

          (c) Purchaser agrees to provide severance benefits to any Hired
Employee whose employment with Purchaser terminates within two years from the
Closing and who would have been entitled to such benefits according to the terms
of the Change in Control Severance Protection Plan II attached as Exhibit E (the
"Severance Plan") had such Hired Employee been a "participant" in such plan at
the time of such Hired Employee's termination. The severance benefits paid to
any such terminated Hired Employee shall be at least equal to the benefits that
such Hired Employee would have been entitled to receive under the Severance Plan
had such Hired Employee been a "participant" in such plan at the time of such
Hired Employee's termination. For purposes of determining the amount required to
be paid, the affected Hired Employee's title shall be deemed to be the higher of
the title which the Hired Employee held immediately prior to October 15, 2002
and the title which the Hired Employee held immediately prior to the Closing.

their Related Persons from and against all Claims with respect to the
termination of a Hired Employee's employment after the Closing Date, except,

understandings or arrangements between a Hired Employee and a Seller or any of
its affiliates.

          (f) Sellers shall not take any action or fail to take any action with
respect to any employees of the Webcasting Business that shall give rise to any
liability of Purchaser under the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act, or any similar state or local Law, rule or regulation.

     4.8 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall not issue any press release or make any such public statement prior to
obtaining the approval of the other Party; provided, however, that such approval
shall not be required where such release or announcement is required by
applicable Law.

     4.9 Confidentiality Agreement. The Nondisclosure Agreement, dated November
7, 2002, between Sellers and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall
remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement until
the Closing, unless terminated as described therein, and is hereby incorporated
herein by reference and shall constitute a part of this Agreement for all

          (a) After the Closing, Sellers and their affiliates will hold, and
will use their best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of Law, all confidential documents and information
concerning the Webcasting Business, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) in the public domain through no fault of Sellers
or their affiliates or (iii) later lawfully acquired by Sellers from sources
other than those related to its prior ownership of the Webcasting Business. The
obligation of Sellers and their affiliates to hold any such information in
confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to
such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own
similar information.

          (b) On and after the Closing Date, Sellers will afford promptly to
Purchaser and its agents reasonable access to its books of account, financial
and other records (including, without limitation, accountants' work papers),
information, employees and auditors to the extent necessary or useful for
Purchaser in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or
any other reasonable business purpose relating to the Webcasting Business.

     4.11 Notices of Certain Events. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Sellers shall give prompt notice in writing to Purchaser of: (i) any
information that indicates that, to the knowledge of Sellers, any of their
representations or warranties contained herein was not true and correct as of
the date hereof or will not be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date
with the same force and effect as if made at and as of the Closing Date; (ii)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which will result, or has a
reasonable prospect of resulting, in the failure of any condition, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement to be complied with or satisfied; (iii)
any failure of any Party to comply with or satisfy any condition, covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; (iv) any notice or
other communication from any person or entity alleging that the consent of such
person or entity is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) any notice or other communication from any
governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (vi) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Sellers or the
Webcasting Business that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing such notices shall not be deemed to cure, or relieve Sellers of
any liability or obligation with respect to, any breach of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant or condition under this Agreement.

     4.12 Noncompetition.

          (a) Sellers agree that for a period of eighteen (18) months from the
Closing Date, neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, or the subsidiaries of
WilTel Communications Group, Inc. shall: (i) engage, either directly or
indirectly, as a principal or for its own account or solely or jointly with
others, or as stockholders in any corporation or joint stock association, in any
business that directly competes with the Webcasting Business in the United
States (the "Restricted Territory"); (ii) directly or indirectly, solicit or
attempt to solicit business or


                                       16




<PAGE>

patronage of any person, partnership, or corporation or other business entity
within the Restricted Territory, for the purpose of production and distribution
of multi-media presentation materials using streaming media technology; provided
however that providing network services to another person who competes with the
Webcasting Business will not be considered a breach of this provision; or (iii)
solicit for employment any Hired Employee.

          (b) If any provision contained in this Section 4.12 shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions
of this Section 4.12, but this Section 4.12 shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It
is the intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too
broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be
null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or
enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
construe and interpret or reform this Section 4.12 to provide for a covenant
having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions
(not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable
under such applicable Law. Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser would be
irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 4.12 and that there would be no
adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Purchaser for any such
breach. Sellers agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief
requiring specific performance by Sellers of this Section 4.12, and Sellers
consent to the entry thereof.

     4.13 Transition Assistance. From the date hereof, Sellers will not in any
manner take or cause to be taken any action which is designed, intended or might
reasonably be anticipated to have the effect of discouraging customers, clients,
sponsors, suppliers, vendors, lessors and other associates of the Webcasting
Business from maintaining the same business relationships with Purchaser after
the date of this Agreement as were maintained with the Webcasting Business prior
to the date of this Agreement.

     4.14 Nonassignable Contracts. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to
the contrary, no Contracts, properties, rights or other Assets shall be deemed
sold, transferred or assigned to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement if the
attempted sale, transfer or assignment thereof to Purchaser without the consent
or approval of another party or governmental authority would be ineffective or
would constitute a breach of contract or a violation of any Law or would in any
other way materially and adversely affect the rights of Sellers (or Purchaser as
transferee or assignee) and such consent or approval is not obtained on or prior
to the Closing Date. In such case, to the extent possible: (i) the beneficial
interest in or to such Contracts, properties or other Assets (collectively, the
"Beneficial Rights") shall in any event pass as of the Closing Date to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall assume or discharge the
liabilities of Sellers under such Beneficial Rights (the "Retained Liabilities")
as agent for Sellers, and Sellers shall act as Purchaser's agent in receipt of
any benefits, rights or interests received from the Beneficial Rights and in
discharging any Retained Liabilities. Purchaser and Sellers shall use reasonable
efforts (and bear their respective costs) without payment of any fees, penalties
or other amounts to any third party to obtain or secure consents or approvals
for the contracts, properties, rights or other Assets that may be necessary to
effect the legal and valid sale, transfer


                                       17




<PAGE>

or assignment of Contracts, properties, rights or other Assets underlying the
Beneficial Rights and Retained Liabilities. Purchaser and Sellers shall make or
complete such transfers as soon as reasonably practicable and cooperate with
each other in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide for Purchaser
the Beneficial Rights including enforcement at the cost and for the account of
Purchaser of any and all rights of Sellers against the other party thereto, and
to provide for the discharge by Purchaser of Retained Liability under such
Contracts, properties or other Assets.

authority in order to relieve Purchaser of any obligation to withhold any
portion of the purchase price hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                          INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

     6.1 Indemnification. Each of the Sellers (jointly and severally) and
Purchaser, as the case may be (each an "Indemnifying Party"), hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party, and its directors,
officers, managers, employees and controlled and controlling persons and
entities (collectively, "Related Persons"), from and against any and all Claims
(as hereinafter defined) asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred by such Party or such Party's Related Persons (each, an "Indemnified
Person"), arising out of or resulting from: (a) the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement; (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Indemnifying Party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or (c) with
respect to Purchaser and its Related Persons, any Excluded Liabilities or, with
respect to each Seller and its Related Persons, any Assumed Liabilities, as
applicable. As used in this Article VI, the term "Claim" shall include: (x) all
debts, liabilities and obligations, (y) all losses, diminutions in value,
damages, costs and expenses, including pre- and post-judgment interest,
penalties, court costs, expert witness fees and attorneys' fees and expenses,
and (z) all demands, claims, actions, costs of investigation, causes of action,
proceedings, arbitrations, judgments, settlements and assessments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) an Indemnified Person shall not be entitled
to seek indemnification under Section 6.1(a) for breach of any representation or
warranty by the Indemnifying Party unless the aggregate amount of assessments,
damages, fines, taxes, penalties, costs and expenses required to be paid
pursuant to


                                       19




<PAGE>

Claims ("Losses") in respect of all such breaches of representations and
warranties and pursuant to Section 6.4 exceeds Twenty-five Thousand Dollars
($25,000), at which point the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Person from and against all such Losses; and (ii) in no event
shall an Indemnifying Party be liable under Section 6.1(a) in respect of
breaches of representations or warranties for Losses and under Section 6.4 in
excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), in the aggregate, except that such
limitations in clause (i) and (ii) above shall not apply to any Unlimited
Representation Claim (as hereafter defined).

     6.2 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event any Claim is asserted
against any Indemnified Person by a third party, the Indemnified Person shall
with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such Claim;
provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give such
notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Article VI, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually
materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In any such proceeding,
following receipt of notice properly given, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled, at its sole discretion, to assume the entire defense of such Claim
(with counsel selected by it which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person or Persons), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the entire cost of
defending such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to settle
any such Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Person or Persons.
In the event of the assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any further legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with such defense
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, the Indemnified Persons shall have the right to participate in such
defense, at their own cost, and the obligation to cooperate therewith.

     6.3 Survival. The representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall survive (notwithstanding any investigation made at any time by or on
behalf of a Party) for a period of one year after the Closing, except with
respect to Claims asserted in writing prior to the end of such one-year period
in which case such representation or warranty shall survive with respect to such
Claim until the final resolution of any such Claim; provided, however, that, (a)
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.1(c),
3.1(d)(i), 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.2(c) and 3.3 and Claims arising out of fraud or
deceit (each, an "Unlimited Representation Claim") shall survive the Closing
indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.1(k) and 3.1(l) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations periods plus 60 days, except with respect to
Claims asserted in writing prior to the end of the applicable time period in
which case such representation or warranty shall survive with respect to such
Claim until the final resolution of any such Claim. The covenants and agreements
made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue to be applicable
and binding thereafter until the expiration of applicable statute of limitations
periods, except with respect to Claims asserted in writing prior to the end of
the applicable time period in which case such covenant or agreement shall
survive with respect to such Claim until the final resolution of any such Claim.
The obligations of each Indemnifying Party to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless an Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 6.1(c) shall survive the
Closing without time limitation and shall not terminate at any time.

     6.4 Starguide Litigation. WCLLC agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Related Persons from and against any and all Claims
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Purchaser in
connection with the litigation disclosed on Schedule 3.1(h) or any other
litigation that Starguide (as defined in Schedule 3.1(h)) may bring against
either Purchaser or Sellers relating directly to the infringement claims which
are the subject of the litigation disclosed in section 3.1(h) (the "Covered
Litigation"). The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate, at Sellers' expense, in
the Covered Litigation; provided that Sellers will not consent to any
settlement, compromise or discharge (including the consent to entry of judgment)
of such litigation which would impact Purchaser's operation of the Webcasting
Business or Purchaser's ability to use the Assets as they are used on the date
hereof in the operation of the Webcasting Business without Purchaser's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                   TERMINATION

     7.1 Termination Rights. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing: (a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Sellers; or (b)
by either Seller or Purchaser if: (i) the Closing has not occurred by February
14, 2003 (provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this clause (i) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement under
this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before such date); or (ii) any governmental authority shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable
(provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (ii) shall not be available to any Party until such Party has used all
commercially reasonable efforts to remove such injunction, order, decree or
ruling).

     7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated by either Seller
or Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no further obligation under this
Agreement on the part of any Party or its respective affiliates, directors,
officers, or stockholders to any other Party, except pursuant to the provisions
of Sections 4.3, 4.8 and 4.9, Article VII and Article VIII, which provisions
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; provided,
however, that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from
any liability for damages incurred as a result of a breach by such Party of its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder occurring prior to such termination.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     8.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the substantive law of the State of New York without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

     8.2 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

     8.3 Assignment; Binding Effect; Third Parties. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
either Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Party; provided that without such consent Purchaser
may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries, in which event such assignee shall be substituted for Purchaser
for purposes of this Agreement to the extent appropriate, but without affecting
any liability of Purchaser hereunder who shall otherwise remain primarily liable
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person, other than the
Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement.

     8.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and any documents referred to therein) and the Services Agreements
constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties, and supersedes all prior
understandings, agreements (other than the Confidentiality Agreement),
arrangements and representations between the Parties, written or oral, to the
extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

Either Party may change its addresses for receiving notices by giving written
notice of such change to the other Party in accordance with this Section 8.5.

     8.6 Litigation Costs. If any Party should hereafter institute litigation
against any other Party alleging that such other Party has breached this
Agreement or any instrument delivered pursuant hereto, the nonprevailing Party
(whether plaintiff or defendant) in such action shall reimburse the prevailing
Party for the prevailing Party's reasonable attorneys' fees, witness fees, court
costs and all other costs in connection with such litigation.

     8.7 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended, and rights
hereunder may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by the Party to be
charged with such amendment or waiver.

     8.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

     8.9 References and Interpretation. All references in this Agreement to
Schedules, Exhibits, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
refer to the corresponding Schedules, Exhibits, Articles, Sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of or to this Agreement unless expressly provided
otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do
not constitute any part of this Agreement, and shall be disregarded in
construing the language hereof. Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement are
attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes. The
words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof," and words
of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Article," "this
Section" and "this subsection," and words of similar import, refer only to the
Article, Section or subsection hereof in which such words occur. The word "or"
is not exclusive, and the word "including" (in its various forms) means
including without limitation. Words, terms and titles (including terms defined
herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice
versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The Parties acknowledge that the
Parties and their counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the
normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the interpretation
of this Agreement. Information set forth in each Schedule specifically refers to
the section of this Agreement to which such information is responsive, and no
disclosure made in any particular Schedule shall be deemed made in any other
Schedule unless expressly made therein (by cross-reference or otherwise) or
unless, and only to the extent that, it is reasonably apparent from the
disclosure that such disclosure contains information which also modifies another
representation and warranty therein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule,
but not otherwise defined therein, shall have the meanings as defined in this
Agreement.

     8.10 Bulk Sales. The Parties do not contemplate sending notices that may be
provided for under any so-called bulk transfer Laws (the "Bulk Transfer Laws")
of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of Assets. Except as provided in
Section 4.5, Sellers agree to indemnify Purchaser against all liability, damage
or expense which Purchaser incurs due to the failure to send notices pursuant to
any Bulk Transfer Laws.

     8.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

     8.12 Knowledge. For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge" of Sellers
shall mean the actual knowledge, after due inquiry, of the following: David
Young, Nick Balletta, Jim Dutton, Craig McElwain.

     8.13 Specific Performance. Sellers hereby acknowledge and agrees that money
damages would not be adequate compensation for the damages that Purchaser would
suffer by reason of a breach of this Agreement by Sellers or a failure of
Sellers to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement and hereby waives
any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate in any action for specific
performance. Therefore, Sellers hereby agree that in addition to and without
limiting any other remedy or right Purchaser may have, Purchaser shall have the
right to an injunction, temporary restraining order or other equitable relief in
any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing
specifically the terms and provisions hereof.
