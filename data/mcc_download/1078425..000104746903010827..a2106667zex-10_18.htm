<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">This
Change of Control Severance Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made and entered
into by and between Luis Buhler (the &#147;Employee&#148;) and Latitude Communications,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), effective as of December 19,
2002.</font></p>

<p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-align:center;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">RECITALS</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It is expected that the Company from
time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company
or other change of control.&#160; The Board
of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) recognizes that such consideration
can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider
alternative employment opportunities.&#160;
The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued
dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility,
threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board believes that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with
an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to
maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of
its stockholders.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">C.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board believes that it is
imperative to provide the Employee with certain benefits upon Employee&#146;s
Involuntary Termination (as defined below) of employment following a Change of
Control that provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and
incentive and encouragement to the Employee to remain with the Company
notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.</font></p>

The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employee&#146;s employment
is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law.&#160; If the Employee&#146;s employment terminates for
any reason, including (without limitation) any termination prior to a Change of
Control, the Employee shall not be entitled to any benefits, damages, awards or
compensation other than as may otherwise be available in accordance with the

If the Employee&#146;s employment terminates as a result of Involuntary
Termination other than for Cause at any time at or within 24 months following a
Change of Control, then, subject to Section 5, the Company (or its successor in
interest) will pay to Employee a lump sum payment equal to one year of his then
current base salary, payable not later than 10 days following the effective
date of such Involuntary Termination.&#160;
In addition, in lieu of the benefit of Section 14(d) of the Company&#146;s
1999 Stock Plan and any similar provisions in any other equity incentive plans
or other stock option or restricted stock purchase agreements between the
Company and Employee, if the Employee&#146;s employment terminates as a result of
Involuntary Termination other than for Cause at any time at or within 24 months
following a Change of Control (as such terms are defined in this Agreement),
then, subject to Section 5, the unvested shares under each stock option granted
to Employee pursuant to the Company&#146;s 1999 Stock Plan shall automatically be
accelerated such that an additional 50% of the total number of unvested shares
as of the effective date of such Involuntary Termination shall automatically
become vested.</font></p>

reason of the Employee&#146;s voluntary resignation (and is not an Involuntary
Termination), or if the Employee is terminated for Cause, then the Employee
shall not be entitled to receive any benefits except for those (if any) as may
then be established under the Company&#146;s then existing severance and benefits

death of the Employee, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive any

hereunder.&#160; In the event Employee is not
the prevailing party, determined without regard to whether or not the action

In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this
Agreement or otherwise payable to the Employee (i) constitute &#147;parachute
payments&#148; within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and (ii) but for this Section 5, would be
subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state income tax law), then the Employee&#146;s
severance benefits under Section 3(a) shall be either</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; delivered in full, or</font></p>

which would result in no portion of such severance benefits being subject to
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts,
taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and
the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by the Employee
on an after-tax-basis, of the greater amount of severance benefits,
notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits may be
taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.&#160;
Unless the Employee otherwise requests in writing (in which event the
Company and the Employee shall mutually agree upon a third party to make the
determination), any determination required under this Section 5 shall be made
in writing by the Accountants, whose determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Employee and the Company for all purposes.&#160; For purposes of making the calculations
required by this Section 5, the determining party shall make reasonable
assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on
reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code.&#160; The Company
and the Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and
documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a
determination under this Section.&#160; The
Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection
with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5.&#160; In the event that subsection (a) above applies, then Employee
shall be responsible for any excise taxes imposed with respect to such
severance and other benefits.&#160; In the
event that subsection (b) above applies, then each benefit provided hereunder
shall be proportionately reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of
such excise taxes.</font></p>
