     maximum  aggregate  principal amount of $10,000,000 (the "Revolving  Credit
     Loan");

     Amended and Restated Secured Term Note dated as of February 15, 2002 (as
     amended from time to time, the "Term Note") by Borrower in favor of Lender
     evidencing a term loan in the initial principal sum of $3,000,000 (the
     "Term Loan", and collectively with the Revolving Credit Loan, the "Loans")

Dear Mr. Wilson:


<PAGE>

         Reference is made to the Loan Agreement and the Term Note. All
capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter agreement shall have the
respective meanings given them in the Loan Agreement.

         The Loans each mature on March 12, 2003. Borrower has requested that
Lender extend the maturity of each Loan to April 12, 2003. Accordingly, upon
Lender's receipt of written acceptance of this letter agreement by Borrower, the
maturity of each of the Loans shall be deemed extended until April 12, 2003.
Such extension is made upon the following terms and conditions:

         1. The entire remaining principal balance of each Loan then
outstanding, together with all unpaid interest accrued thereon, and all other
unpaid fees, costs and charges, shall become immediately due and payable on
April 12, 2003, if payment is not made or demanded sooner; provided that
advances made under the Revolving Credit Loan during such extension period shall
be subject to Lender's sole discretion.

         2. Borrower hereby confirms and agrees to the following:

                  (a) Any further extension of either Loan must be made via
binding written agreement, and no such agreements exist as of the date of this
letter agreement. No past, present or future verbal discussions with regard to a
further extension of either of the Loans shall be binding upon Lender. No
representations have been made by Lender as to any future extension of either
Loan.

                  (b) Borrower has no defenses, counterclaims, setoffs,
recoupments or other adverse claims or causes of action of any kind existing
with respect to the Loans, the Obligations, the Loan Documents or this letter
agreement.

                  (c) The Loan Documents, and all covenants, agreements and
conditions set forth therein, are hereby ratified and reaffirmed by Borrower as
of the date hereof and shall remain in full force and effect as modified herein.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to constitute a novation of the
Loan Documents or the lending relationship between Borrower and Lender.

                  (d) Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to waive
(i) any defaults which may now or in the future exist under the Loan Documents
or (ii) any rights and remedies of Lender in respect of such defaults,
including, but not limited to, the right to accelerate the maturity of either
Loan.

                  (e) Borrower hereby fully, finally, and absolutely and forever
releases and discharges Lender and its present and former directors,
shareholders, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns, and their separate and respective heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns, from any and all actions, causes of action, claims,
debts, damages, demands, liabilities, obligations and suits, of whatever kind or
nature, in law or equity of Borrower, whether now known or unknown to Borrower,
and whether contingent or matured (i) in respect of either Loan, the Loan
Agreement, the Term Note or any other Loan Document, or the actions or omissions

                                       2
<PAGE>

of Lender in respect of either Loan, the Loan Agreement, the Term Note or the
Loan Documents; or (ii) arising from events occurring prior to the date of this
letter agreement.

3. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Maryland. This letter agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, including by facsimile signature, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute but one
instrument.

         4. Borrower shall pay Lender an extension fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00). This fee shall be non-refundable. If on or prior to April 12, 2003,
Lender agrees to renew either Loan for one year from the Closing Date, this
extension fee may be applied toward payment of the renewal commitment fee.

                               [SIGNATURES FOLLOW]

                                       3
