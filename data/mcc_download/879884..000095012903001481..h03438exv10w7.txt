                  (d)      United Wellhead Services of Louisiana, Inc.;

                  (e)      Wellhead Recycling, Inc.;

hereby revokes its designation of each of the De-Designated Subsidiaries as a
Guarantor. The Agent and the Required Banks hereby (a) accept such foregoing
revocation, and (b) agree that no mandatory

release its Liens on the assets owned and/or leased by the De-Designated
Subsidiaries, (ii) the originals of any applicable Guaranty Agreement executed

described on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement (and the original stock powers
that correspond to such stock certificates), and (iv) such other documents,
releases or other instruments in respect of such revocation as the Borrower may
reasonably request.

         Borrower of the assets or stock of any Guarantor or any Subsidiary of
         the Borrower, or by any Guarantor of the assets or stock of any
         Subsidiary of the Borrower;"

Section 2.05  Addition of Section 10.12.  The following language is added to
the Agreement as Section 10.12:

                  Section 10.12 Restrictions on Certain Subsidiaries.
