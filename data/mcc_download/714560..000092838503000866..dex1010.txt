                               SEVERANCE AGREEMENT

          Agreement dated as of April 8, 2002, between US Airways, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, having a place of business at Crystal Park Four, 2345
Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22227 (the "Company") and Jerrold A. Glass,
residing at 9491 Harrow Hill Lane, Burke, VA 22015 (the "Executive").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

          WHEREAS, the Executive has assumed duties of a responsible nature to
the benefit of the Company and to the satisfaction of its Board of Directors
(the "Board");

          WHEREAS, the Board believes it to be in the best interests of the
Company to enter into this Agreement to assure Executive's continuing services
to the Company including, but not limited to, under circumstances in which there
is a possible, threatened or actual severance of employment or Change of Control
(as defined below) of the Company; and

          WHEREAS, the Board believes it is imperative to diminish the
inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties
and risks created by a pending or threatened severance of employment or Change
of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the
Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of
Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits
arrangements upon a severance of employment which ensure that the compensation
and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are
competitive with those of other corporations. Therefore, in order to accomplish
all the above objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this
Agreement.

Company prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is
reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment or
cessation of status as an officer (i) was at the request of a third party who
has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change of Control or (ii)
otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of the Change of Control,

the date immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment or
cessation of status as an officer.

65th birthday ("Normal Retirement Date"); provided, however, that commencing on
the date one year after the

                                        2

annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Renewal
Date"), the Employment Period shall be automatically extended so as to terminate
on the earlier of (x) three years from such Renewal Date or (y) the Executive's

Control Date, the Employment Period shall automatically be extended so as to
terminate on the earlier to occur of (1) the third anniversary of such date or
(2) the Executive's Normal Retirement Date.

          (e)  "Key Employee" shall mean a senior vice president level employee

nomination for election by Group's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at
least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be
considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest (as
such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents;

indirectly, less than 85% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case
may be, of the corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or
consolidation (or any parent thereof) in substantially the same proportions as
their ownership, immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or
consolidation of the Outstanding Group Common Stock and the Outstanding Group
Voting Securities, as the case may be; or

corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Group Common Stock and Outstanding
Group Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in
substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such

     performing his duties in accordance with Section 4(a)(iii) hereof, it shall
     re-elect the Executive to the position of Senior Vice President with
     substantially similar duties to the position held by the Executive on the
     Effective Date, and (B) the Executive's services shall be performed at the

     Date, the Company's headquarters, or a location where a substantial
     activity for which the Executive has responsibility is located.

                   (ii)  During the Employment Period and on and following a
     Change of Control Date, (A) the Executive's position (including status,
     offices, titles and reporting relationships), authority, duties and
     responsibilities shall be at least commensurate in all material respects
     with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any time
     during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change of Control Date
     and (B) the Executive's services shall be performed at the location where
     the Executive was employed immediately preceding the Change of Control Date
     or any office or location where a substantial activity for which the
     Executive has responsibility is located.

     periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the
     Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal
     business hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the
     extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the
     Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best efforts to
     perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. During the
     Employment Period it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the
     Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or
     committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at
     educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as
     such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the

     with this Agreement. It is also expressly understood and agreed that to the
     extent that such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to
     the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the
     conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to

     than his base salary in effect on the last day of the preceding 12-month
     period. During the Change of Control Period, base salary shall be reviewed
     at least annually and shall be increased at any time and from time to time
     as shall be substantially consistent with increases in base salary awarded
     in the ordinary course of business to other Key Employees of the Company
     and its subsidiaries. Any increase in base salary shall not serve to limit
     or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. Base
     salary shall not be reduced after any such increase. Base salary under
     Section 4(b)(i) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Base Salary".

     more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in effect
     at any time thereafter with respect to other Key Employees.

         (iv) Welfare Benefit Plans. During the Change of Control Period, the
     Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be
     eligible for participation in and shall receive all benefits under welfare
     benefit plans, practices, policies and programs applicable to other Key
     Employees (including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental,
     disability, salary continuance, employee life, group life, accidental death
     and travel accident insurance plans and programs), in each case providing

5.   TERMINATION.

     (a)  Mutual Agreement. During the Employment Period, the Executive's
employment hereunder may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement on terms
to be negotiated at the time of such termination.

     (b)  Death or Disability. This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon
the Executive's death. If the Company determines in good faith that the
Disability of the Executive has occurred (pursuant to the definition of
"Disability" set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice of
its intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the
Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 90th
day after receipt by the Executive of such notice given at any time after a
period of six consecutive months of Disability and while such Disability is
continuing (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 90 days
after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time
performance of the Executive's duties. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Disability" means disability which, at least six months after its commencement,
is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company
or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's

Date, Executive shall be entitled to all compensation provided for under Section
4 hereof, to the extent applicable.

     (c)  Cause. During the Employment Period, the Company may terminate the
Executive's employment for "Cause." For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause"
means (1) a reasonable good faith determination by the Company that the
Executive engaged in an act or acts of personal dishonesty intended to result in
substantial personal enrichment of the Executive at the expense of the Company,
(2) repeated violations by the Executive of the Executive's obligations under
Section 4(a) of this Agreement which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on
the Executive's part and which are not remedied in a reasonable period of time
after receipt of written notice from the Company or (3) the conviction of the
Executive of a felony.

     (d)  Good Reason. During the Employment Period, the Executive's employment
hereunder may be terminated by the Executive for Good Reason. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Good Reason" means:

     (i)  with respect to the termination of the Executive's employment other
     than during the Change of Control Period:

          (1)  any reduction by the Company of the Executive's rate of base
               salary, as in effect on the Effective Date or as the same may be
               increased from time to time;

          (2)  any material and substantial diminution in the Executive's
               position, authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated
               by Section 4(a)(i) of this Agreement, or any other action by the
               Company which results in a material and substantial diminution in
               such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding
               for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent
               action not taken in bad faith

                                       10

<PAGE>

               and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of
               notice thereof given by the Executive;

          (3)  any demotion of the Executive to a position lower than Senior
               Vice President; or

          (4)  any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section
               11(c) of this Agreement, and

     (ii) with respect to the termination of the Executive's employment during
     the Change of Control Period:

          (1)  the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any
               respect with Executive's position (including status, offices,
               titles and reporting relationships), authority, duties or
               responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) or (iii) of
               this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results
               in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or
               responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated,
               insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and
               which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice
               thereof given by the Executive;

          (2)  (x) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the
               provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement, other than an
               isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in
               bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after
               receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive or (y) any
               failure of the Company to pay Base Salary or Annual Bonus in
               accordance with Sections 4(b)(i) and (ii), respectively, and any
               failure by the Company to maintain or provide the plans,
               programs, policies and practices, and benefits described in
               Sections 4(b)(iii) - (vii) on the most favorable basis such
               plans, programs, policies and practices were maintained and
               benefits provided during the 90-day period immediately preceding
               the Change of Control Date, or if more favorable to the Executive
               and/or the Executive's family, as in effect at any time
               thereafter with respect to other Key Employees;

          (3)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office
               or location other than that described in Section 4(a)(ii)(B)
               hereof, except for travel reasonably required in the performance
               of the Executive's responsibilities;

                                       11

<PAGE>

          (4)  any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's
               employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this
               Agreement; or

          (5)  any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section
               11(c) of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 5(d)(ii), any good faith determination of "Good
Reason" made by the Executive on or after the Change of Control Date shall be
conclusive.

     (e)  Notice of Termination. Any termination during the Change of Control
Period by the Company for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in
accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the
specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and
(iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of
receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not
more than fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the
Executive to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance
which contributes to a showing of Good Reason shall not waive any right of the
Executive hereunder or preclude the Executive from asserting such fact or
circumstance in enforcing his rights hereunder. Any termination other than
during the Change of Control Period by the Company for Cause or by the Executive
for Good Reason shall be communicated by written notice (which written notice
shall not constitute a Notice of Termination hereunder) to the other party
hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement.

                                       12

<PAGE>

     (f)  Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" means the date of receipt
of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case
may be; provided, however, that (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated
by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and
(ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or
Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive
or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

     (g)  Dispute Concerning Termination. If within fifteen (15) days after any
Notice of Termination is given, or, if later, prior to the Date of Termination
(as determined without regard to this Section 5(g)), the party receiving such
Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning
the termination, the Date of Termination shall be extended until the earlier of
(i) the date on which the Change of Control Period ends or (ii) the date on
which the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the
parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of
competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the
time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected);
provided, however, that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of
dispute given by the Executive only if such notice is given in good faith and
the Executive pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence;
and provided further, this Section 5(g) shall be applicable only for
terminations of employment occurring during the Change of Control Period.

     (h)  Compensation During Dispute. If a purported termination occurs during
the Change of Control Period and the Date of Termination is extended in

                                       13

dispute was given (including, but not limited to, Base Salary) and continue the
Executive as a participant in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in
which the Executive was participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute
was given, until the Date of Termination, as determined in accordance with

6.   OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UPON TERMINATION.

          (a)  Death.

          (i)  If the Executive's employment is terminated during the Change of
               Control Period by reason of the Executive's death, this Agreement
               shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's
               legal representatives under this Agreement, other than those
               obligations accrued or earned and vested (if applicable) by the
               Executive as of the Date of Termination, including, for this
               purpose (1) the Executive's full Base Salary through the Date of
               Termination at the rate in effect on the Date of Termination,
               disregarding any reduction in Base Salary in violation of this
               Agreement (the "Highest Base Salary"), (2) the product of the
               Annual Bonus paid to the Executive for the last full fiscal year
               and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
               the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and the
               denominator of which is 365 and (3) any

                                       14

<PAGE>

               compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
               with any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by the
               Company and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid by the Company
               (such amounts specified in clauses (1) through (3)) are
               hereinafter referred to as "Accrued Obligations" and such amounts
               specified in clauses (1) and (3) are hereinafter referred to as
               "Termination Obligations"). Anything in this Agreement to the
               contrary notwithstanding, the Executive's family shall be
               entitled to receive benefits in accordance with the most
               favorable plans, programs, practices and policies of the Company
               and its subsidiaries in effect during the 90-day period
               immediately preceding the Change of Control Date, or if more
               favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in
               effect at any time thereafter with respect to other Key
               Employees.

          (ii) If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the
               Executive's death other than during the Change of Control Period,
               this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the
               Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement other than
               the Termination Obligations.

          (iii) All such Accrued Obligations and Termination Obligations shall
               be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiary, as applicable,
               in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination
               or the date of termination (as applicable).

                                       15

          (b)  Disability.

          (i)  If the Executive's employment is terminated during the Change of
               Control Period by reason of the Executive's Disability, this
               Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the
               Executive, other than those obligations accrued or earned and
               vested (if applicable) by the Executive as of the Date of
               Termination, including for this purpose, all Accrued Obligations.
               Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
               Executive shall be entitled after the Disability Effective Date
               to receive disability and other benefits in accordance with the
               most favorable plans, programs, practices and policies of the
               Company and its subsidiaries in effect during the 90-day period
               immediately preceding the Change of Control Date, or if more
               favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in
               effect at any time thereafter with respect to other Key
               Employees.

          (ii) If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the
               Executive's Disability other than during the Change of Control
               Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further
               obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other than the
               Termination Obligations.

                                       16

<PAGE>

          (iii) All such Accrued Obligations and Termination Obligations shall
               be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of
               the Date of Termination or the date of termination (as
               applicable).

          (c)  Cause; Other than for Good Reason. If during the Employment
Period the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause or the Executive
terminates his employment other than for Good Reason, this Agreement shall
terminate without further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement
other than those obligations accrued or earned and vested (if applicable) by the
Executive through the Date of Termination or the date of termination (as
applicable), including for this purpose, the Termination Obligations. All such
Termination Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash
within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

          (d)  Good Reason; Other Than for Cause or Disability.

               (1)  If, during the Employment Period and prior to a Change of
     Control, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than
     for Cause, Disability or death or if the Executive shall terminate his
     employment for Good Reason, the Company shall pay to the Executive in a
     lump sum in cash within 30 days after the date of termination the aggregate
     of the following amounts:

               A.        to the extent not theretofore paid, the Executive's
                    annual rate of base salary as in effect immediately prior to
                    the date of termination; and

               B.        the product of two (2) times the sum of (x) the
                    Executive's annual rate of base salary as in effect
                    immediately prior to the date of termination, and (y) the
                    Executive's "target bonus" under the Incentive Plan for the
                    year in which the date of termination occurs; and

                                       17

<PAGE>

               C.        in the case of compensation previously deferred by the
                    Executive, all amounts previously deferred (together with
                    any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by the
                    Company, and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid by the
                    Company; and

               (2)  If, during the Employment Period and on and after a
Change of Control Date, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
other than for Cause, Disability, or death or if the Executive shall terminate
his employment for Good Reason:

               (i)       the Company shall pay to the Executive in a lump sum in
cash within 30 days after the Date of Termination the aggregate of the following
amounts:

               A.        to the extent not theretofore paid, the Executive's
                         Highest Base Salary through the Date of Termination;
                         and

               B.        the product of (x) the Annual Bonus paid to the
                         Executive for the last full fiscal year ending during
                         the Change of Control Period or, if higher, the Annual
                         Bonus paid to the Executive during the last full fiscal
                         year ending during the Change of Control Period or, if
                         higher, a constructive annual bonus calculated at the
                         "target bonus" level under the Incentive Plan in effect
                         immediately preceding the Change of Control Date (the
                         highest Annual Bonus determined under this clause (x)
                         shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Recent Bonus")
                         and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                         number of days in the current fiscal year through the
                         Date of Termination and the denominator of which is
                         365: and

               C.        the product of (x) three and (y) the sum of (i) the
                         Highest Base Salary and (ii) the Recent Bonus; and

               D.        in the case of compensation previously deferred by the
                         Executive, all amounts previously deferred (together
                         with any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by
                         the Company, and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid
                         by the Company; and

                                       18

<PAGE>

               (ii) The Company shall:

               A.        for a period of three years following the Date of
                    Termination or such longer period as any plan, program,
                    practice or policy may provide, the Company shall continue
                    benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at
                    least equal to those which would have been provided to them
                    in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and
                    policies described in Sections 4(b)(iii)(with respect to any
                    retirement plans), (iv) and (vi) of this Agreement as if the
                    Executive's employment had not been terminated and as if the
                    Change of Control Period expired on the 3rd anniversary of
                    the Date of Termination, and for purposes of eligibility for
                    retiree benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs
                    and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have
                    remained employed until the 3rd anniversary of the Date of
                    Termination; and

               B.        the Company shall provide continuation of Travel
                    Privileges for the life of the Executive which are at least
                    as favorable as the benefits provided pursuant to the most
                    favorable of such plans, practices, policies and programs in
                    effect at any time during the 90-day period immediately
                    preceding the Change of Control Date or, if more favorable
                    to the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as in effect
                    at any time thereafter with respect to other Key Employees.

          (e)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, upon termination of the Executive's employment for any reason
following the 5th anniversary of the Executive's date of employment, the
Executive shall be entitled to the Travel Privileges described in 6(d)(2)(ii)(B)
above.

7.   NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.

     Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plans,
programs, policies or practices, provided by Group, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein
limit or otherwise affect such rights as the

                                       19

<PAGE>

Executive may have under any stock option, restricted stock or other agreements
with Group, the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Amounts which are vested
benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any Plan,
policy, practice or program of Group, the Company or any of its subsidiaries at
or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with
such plan, policy, practice or program.

8.   FULL SETTLEMENT.

          The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this
Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right
or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no
event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company agrees to pay, to the full
extent permitted by law (a) all legal fees and expenses, as incurred by the
Company, the Executive and others, which the Executive may reasonably incur as a
result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company or
others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision
of this Agreement (other than Section 6(d)(1) and 6(e)) or any guarantee of
performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about
the amount of any payment pursuant of Section 9 of this Agreement) and (b) all
legal fees and expenses, as incurred by the Company, the Executive and others,
which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest by the
Company or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under,
Section 6(d)(1) and 6(e) of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance
thereof but only, in the case of this clause (b), if the Executive prevails on
at

                                       20

<PAGE>

least one material issue in such contest plus, in the case of clauses (a) and
(b), interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)
(or any successor provision thereto) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").

9.   CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.

          (a)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company
to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed
or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section
9, including, but not limited to, any amounts in respect of (i) options to
acquire shares of Group common stock, (ii) restricted shares of Group common
stock, and (iii) the letter agreement entered into as of April 8, 2002 between
the Executive and the Company with respect to supplemental retirement benefits,
as amended (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section
4999 (or any successor provision thereto) of the Code or any interest or
penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any
such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income and employment taxes
(and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax,
imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon Payments.

                                       21

<PAGE>

          (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c), all determinations
required to be made under this Section 9, including whether a Gross-Up Payment
is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by a firm of
independent public accountants selected by Group prior to the Change of Control
(the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations
both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the
receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such
earlier time as is requested by the Company or the Executive. In the event that
the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual,
entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint
another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations
required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to
this Section 9, shall be paid to the Executive within five (5) days of the
receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm
determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the
Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on the
Executive's applicable federal income tax return would not result in the
imposition of a negligence or other penalty. Any determination by the Accounting
Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the
uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor
provision thereto) at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting
Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-up Payments which will not have been
made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the
calculations required to be made hereunder. In the

                                       22

<PAGE>

event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 9(c) and the
Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the
Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment (together with
interest and penalties incurred by the Executive in connection therewith) that
has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to
or for the benefit of the Executive.

          (c)  The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by
the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by
the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as
practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive knows
of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the
date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay
such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period following the date
on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on
the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the
Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period
that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

          (i)  give the Company any information reasonably requested by the
          Company relating to such claim,

          (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the
          Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
          including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with
          respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the
          Company,

          (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to
          contest such claim,

          (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to
          such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay
          directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and
          penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall
          indemnify and hold the

                                       23

<PAGE>

          Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or
          income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto,
          imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and
          expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this
          Section 9(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in
          connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or
          forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
          conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and
          may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax
          claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible
          manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a
          determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of
          initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the
          Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company
          directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the
          Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on
          an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive
          harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax,
          including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with
          respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with
          respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of
          the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the
          taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
          amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
          amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be
          limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be
          payable hereunder; whereas the Executive shall be entitled to settle
          or contest, as the case may be, any other issued raised by the
          Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

          (d)  If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by
the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive
any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the
Company's complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay to the
Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited
thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive
of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination
is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to
such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its
intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30)
days after such

                                       24

<PAGE>

determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to
be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof,
the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

          The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of
the Company all confidential and proprietary information, relating to Group, the
Company or any of their subsidiaries, and their respective businesses, which
shall have been obtained by the Executive's employment by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than
by acts by Executive or his representatives in violation of this Agreement).
After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, communicate or
divulge any such information to anyone other than the Company and those
designated by it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive or his
representatives may disclose any such information if such information is
compelled by legal process, provided that if Executive is so compelled, he shall
provide the Company with prompt notice so that it may seek a protective order or
other remedy. In any event, Executive shall furnish only that portion of the
confidential information that is legally required to be disclosed. In the event
the Executive breaches any provision of this Section 10, any payments or other
